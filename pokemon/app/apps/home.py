        The following list describes the worflow for this project:
        
        1. Fetch the data from Bulbapedia.
        2. Create three sections for the analysis:
            - pokemon-episodes graph
            - pokemon-routes graph
            - sentiment analysis of pokemons belonging to the same **Type** category
        3. Create a website using **Plotly Dash**.
        
        ## Page navigation

        ## Graphs traits
        
        The generated graphs are **interactive** graphs. It is possible to:
        - display more information about the single/multiple nodes by:
            - hovering over single node
            - clicking on the single node
            - selecting multiple nodes with the lasso/box tools (top right corner of the graph)
        - zoom in and zoom out by:
            - pressing + and - buttons in the graph tools
            - double clicking on the graph (default zoom in, followed by zoom out)
            - selecting an area with a mouse to zoom in
        - move throughout the graph by holding Shift, left mouse button and by hovering the mouse
        multiple nodes with the
