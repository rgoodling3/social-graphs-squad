VS {{tt|Yarukimono|Vigoroth}}!\'\') is the third episode of the {{series|Advanced Generation}} and the 277th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on December 5, 2002 and in the United States on November 15, 2003.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/06_15-theres-no-place-like-hoenn/-->\n<i>Ash and May have made it all the way to Petalburg City—the first city with a gym. Ash is very excited to take on the gym leader. May seems a little uneasy—perhaps it\'s because she hasn\'t yet told Ash that her father, Norman, is the gym leader in Petalburg! When Ash first gets to the gym, he meets May\'s little brother, Max, who is pretending to be the gym leader. Max knows a lot about Pokémon and can\'t wait until he\'s old enough to become a trainer. Once Ash finally meets Norman, he learns that he will need three Pokémon in order to battle at the gym. He only has Pikachu with him. When Norman agrees to an unofficial battle, Ash encounters his first Vigoroth. Ash realizes that he will have to train hard in order to win a badge in Petalburg City. After a quick scuffle with Team Rocket, Ash and May are ready to hit the road again. Max has decided to tag along, too!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{an|May}} arrive at [[Petalburg City]], and as the pair sits down in a park, Ash is quick to bring up the [[Hoenn League]]. He asks May if she wants to compete in the League, but she is startled and laughs off the idea. Ash wonders what the Petalburg [[Gym Leader]] is like, and May replies that she is sure "he" is a nice guy. Ash becomes suspicious of May\'s familiarity with the Gym Leader, but she admits having heard a lot about him on the streets. Ash suggests they go to the [[Gym]] together, but May rushes off to take care of things.\n\nAsh soon reaches the [[Petalburg Gym]], steps inside, and reaches the main arena. He tries introducing himself to present a challenge, but there is initially no response. Ash tries again, just as a young boy carrying books walks into the room. The boy recognizes Ash and asks him if he was in the [[Silver Conference]]. Ash confirms this and says he got all the way to victory round. The boy tries to remember Ash\'s name and guesses it is "Alf". After Ash corrects him, the boy goes onto criticize Ash\'s performance against [[Harrison\'s Blaziken]]. Ash becomes infuriated by the young boy\'s sharp comments and orders him to call out the Gym Leader. In a surprising twist, the boy claims he is the Gym Leader. Ash doubts it, but immediately asks if he could challenge him and the boy accepts. As both of them prepare battle, the boy says that they will each use three Pokémon, though Ash only has Pikachu to fight for him. At that moment, May peers through a window and returns with two other people, her parents. May asks the boy, who turns out to be her little brother [[Max]], what he is doing acting like the Gym Leader.\n\nMay formally introduces her family to Ash. It is revealed that Max is too young to be a {{pkmn|Trainer}}, and Max and May\'s father, [[Norman]], is the real Gym Leader. May\'s mother, [[Caroline]] thanks Ash for helping escort May home. Caroline then turns her attention to May\'s missing [[bicycle]], and she explains that [[AG001|Pikachu shocked it to a crisp]]. Max asks to see which [[starter Pokémon]] May chose, and she sends out {{TP|May|Torchic}}. Max is disappointed that May picked Torchic, and states that he would have picked {{p|Treecko}}, which causes Torchic to start {{m|peck}}ing him, much to Ash\'s amusement. Caroline doesn\'t mind the extra company, so Ash decides to enjoy lunch with the family. Over the dinner table, Ash reveals that he used to travel with {{ashfr}}. During the meal, Ash asks about the rules Norman uses for his matches; Max makes a comment that it was the same rules as he stated before, a three-on-three match. When Ash is dismayed by this, Caroline tells him that he can have his Pokémon sent to the [[Pokémon Center]]. However, Ash replies that he wants to start fresh and only use Pokémon he catches in [[Hoenn]]. Norman is impressed by Ash’s ambitions and offers him an unofficial match, but Ash doesn\'t mind. Just after lunch, everyone goes back to the arena for the battle.\n\nAs the battle starts, Ash uses Pikachu and Norman sends out {{p|Vigoroth}}. Ash looks it up on his [[Pokédex]] to see how to handle the Pokémon. When the Pokédex tells him that Vigoroth is both powerful and quick, Ash feels he has an advantage since he emphasizes on speed. Unbeknownst to everyone, {{TRT}} has been spying on them through a window. The villainous trio plan their next move to see if they can snag Ash\'s Pikachu, and maybe the Gym Leader\'s Pokémon. The first strike is a {{m|Thunderbolt}} from Pikachu, but Vigoroth uses its quick reflexes to easily jump away. Vigoroth soon runs towards Pikachu at high speed and {{m|Slash}}es him. As a result, Ash switches from {{t|Electric}} [[move]]s to physical attacks, and Pikachu sprints into a {{m|Quick Attack}}. Even so, Pikachu\'s speed is still no match for Vigoroth; Pikachu ends up being tossed around, and is eventually defeated.\n\nSuddenly, Team Rocket blows a hole in one of the Gym\'s walls. Unaware of the threat, Caroline thanks Team Rocket for assisting May on her journey so far, thinking they are friends. Team Rocket scoffs at the idea and launches into their {{motto}}. [[Jessie]] then sends out {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}} and [[James]] calls on {{TP|James|Weezing}} to attack the group. Weezing uses {{m|Smokescreen}}, as Arbok use {{m|Headbutt}} on Pikachu. Vigoroth decides to help, but when it cannot see through the Smokescreen, Max suggests that May should use her Pokémon. Nervously, May calls out her {{TP|May|Torchic}}, but as she pauses to think, Arbok lands an attack on Torchic. As Jessie gets ready to steal Vigoroth and Pikachu, Ash has Pikachu use Thunderbolt on them, but it hits Max by accident. As Ash checks to see if he is okay, Team Rocket escapes in the Smokescreen. Once the dust settles, May realizes she has lost her Torchic.\n\nThe Rocket trio flee in their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|balloon]]. They soon land, and [[Jessie]] reaches into the loot bag to find Torchic instead. Torchic retaliates and lands an {{m|Ember}} attack on James\'s face. Jessie is upset, admitting that Torchic is definitely not Team Rocket material. {{MTR}} comes up with a backup plan and suggests they use Torchic as bait to get Pikachu. Meanwhile, May\'s family and Ash decides to split up to cover more ground in their search for Torchic. Caroline and Norman search together, leaving the children on their own. Max first attempts to use a magnifying glass to find footprints, but May reminds him that Team Rocket fled in a balloon. May’s parents soon return with good news; they\'ve located Team Rocket nearby. They reach the clearing, and Ash confirms that the balloon is unmistakably Team Rocket’s. May spots her Torchic stuck in a cage, so she and little brother rush forward. Ash tries to call them back, but it is too late as the pair fall into a hole. Norman and Caroline run after them; Ash tries to stop them as well, but they fall into another pitfall trap. The Rocket trio emerge from hiding to laugh at the family’s predicament.\n\nAsh reaches for {{AP|Bayleef}}\'s [[Poké Ball]], but he quickly remembers that he only has Pikachu with him. As Ash peers into the pitfall trap, Jessie calls for Arbok to attack. Ash sends Pikachu out to confront the Rocket trio while he helps May and Max out of the hole. Caroline and Norman make it out on their own. Norman is infuriated at the Rocket trio for stealing his daughter\'s first Pokémon and he sends Vigoroth into the fray. James calls on Weezing to even things out. Meanwhile, Max sneaks passed and reaches Torchic\'s cage, freeing it. Torchic returns to May, who tries to use its attacks at Max\'s suggestion. Meanwhile, Arbok wraps itself around Vigoroth, so Ash has Pikachu help it by using Quick Attack on Arbok. Then, May tries to use Torchic\'s "Amber" attack, but Max corrects her, saying she meant "Ember". When May commands it again, Torchic attacks Max by mistake. This time, she tells it to use Peck, but again it attacks Max. Meanwhile, Arbok Headbutts Pikachu and Vigoroth tackles them both into the balloon. Then, Pikachu finishes it off with Thunderbolt, sending Team Rocket blasting off.\n\nDespite the theft, some good has come of the situation: May and Torchic are already showing signs of bonding. Later, back in front of Norman\'s Gym, as May and Ash are about to resume their journey, Max insists that he is traveling with them. Norman notes that Max will be a good help thanks to his wide knowledge, while Caroline says it will be a lot less trouble for her. Despite May\'s clear irritation, Norman asks Ash, who quickly agrees to the idea.  As a gift, Norman gives Ash and May a Badge case each and Max is thrilled to receive a [[PokéNav]]. With his new toy in hand, Max rushes ahead as Norman directs Ash to [[Rustboro City]] for the closest Gym.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and {{an|May}} arrive in [[Petalburg City]].\n* Ash goes to the [[Petalburg Gym]] and meets May\'s brother [[Max]], her mother [[Caroline]], and her father [[Norman]], the local [[Gym Leader]].\n* Ash is unable to have an official Gym battle as he needs three {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. He is allowed to have an unofficial battle, but loses.\n* Max encounters {{TRT}} for the first time.\n* Max joins {{ashfr|the group}}.\n* Max receives a [[PokéNav]] while Ash and May receive a [[Badge]] case each from Norman.\n* Ash learns of [[Rustboro Gym|the Gym]] in [[Rustboro City]] and decides to head there.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Norman]]\n* [[Caroline]]\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n*{{p|Vigoroth}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Norman]]\n* [[Caroline]]\n* [[Professor Birch]] (flashback)\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP AG003.png|thumb|200px|right|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Cleffa}}\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Charizard}} ({{OP|Ash|Charizard}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Torchic}} ({{OP|May|Torchic}})\n* {{p|Arbok}} ({{OP|Jessie|Arbok}})\n* {{p|Weezing}} ({{OP|James|Weezing}})\n* {{p|Vigoroth}} ([[Norman]]\'s; debut)\n* {{p|Blaziken}} ({{OP|Harrison|Blaziken}}; flashback)\n\n==Trivia==\n* The [[eyecatch]]es are updated in this episode to include [[Max]].\n* When [[EP007|first arriving]] in [[Cerulean City|her home city]], {{an|Misty}} was also wary of {{Ash}} going to the local [[Gym]] because of it being run by family, just like {{an|May}} is in this episode.\n* When May calls out Amber instead of {{m|Ember}}, an image of a mushroom goes across the screen. This was a joke that was only understandable in the Japanese version because \'\'kinoko\'\' (mushroom) sounds very similar to \'\'hinoko\'\' (Ember).\n* The title of this episode is a reference to the common saying "\'\'There\'s no place like home\'\'".\n* Music from \'\'[[PK01|Pikachu\'s Vacation]]\'\' can be heard in this episode.\n* This is the first episode where an instrumental version of [[Advance Adventure]] is used as the new action sequence in the Japanese version. This arrangement is used throughout the {{series|Advanced Generation}} and as its preview theme.\n\n===Errors===\n* The scene with {{p|Blaziken}}\'s hands being red instead of gray is used for a flashback.\n* Ash calls Max by name before knowing him.\n* After [[Ash\'s Pikachu]] lost the battle to [[Norman]]\'s {{p|Vigoroth}}, the back of Ash\'s shoe had a different design between scenes.\n* When Ash is thinking about his {{AP|Noctowl}}, his shirt is missing.\n* When they find {{TRT}}\'s hot-air balloon, Norman\'s left hand is missing.\n* At the end of the episode, Ash and May are leaving and waving goodbye. However, instead of walking off-screen, for a split-second, they appear to walk in place at the screen boundary.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* Two separate scenes showing [[James]]\'s head and Max on fire due to {{TP|May|Torchic}}\'s Ember attack were cut from the dub for being too violent.\n* After the scene when James is caught on fire, the scene of Torchic with a sad expression was also taken out from the dub.\n* In the {{DL|Pokémon in the United States|Kids\' WB}} version of this episode and [[List of English language Pokémon Advanced home video releases (Region 1)|first two North American home video releases]], the {{i|Poké Ball}} design on Ash\'s and May\'s Badge cases are painted over and replaced with rectangles. This edit occurs every time Ash\'s Badge case appears in the Hoenn saga, though it initially did not happen in international airings. This also does not occur in the [[List of English language Pokémon Advanced home video releases (Region 1)|2017 North American home video release]], Cartoon Network and Boomerang airings, [[List of English language Pokémon Advanced home video releases (Region 4)|Australian home video releases]], [[Pokémon TV]], Disney NOW, and [[List of digital home video releases of Pokémon anime|digital home video releases]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:AG003 Error 2.png|Ash\'s missing shirt\nFile:AG003 Cut shot.png|Shot cut from the dub\nFile:AG003 Error.png|Blaziken\'s miscolored hands\nAG003 badge case without edit.png|Badge case without Kids\' WB! edit\nAG003 badge case edit.png|Badge case with Kids\' WB! edit\n</gallery>\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=9999FF|bordercolor=FF7777\n|zh_cmn={{tt|橙華道館對抗過動猿！|Chénghuá (Petalburg) Gym, VS Vigoroth!}}\n|da={{tt|Hjem, kære hjem|Home, sweet home}}\n|de={{tt|Nervensäge Max|Nag Max}}\n|nl={{tt|Oost west, Hoenn best|East west, Hoenn best}}\n|fi={{tt|Oma Hoenn kullan kallis|Hoenn sweet Hoenn}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Réunion de famille|Family Reunion}}\n|he=אין כמו הוון{{tt|ein kmo Hoenn|There\'s Nothing Like Hoenn}}\n|it={{tt|Il fratellino|The little brother}}\n|ko={{tt|동화체육관, 피카츄 VS 발바로|Petalburg Gym, Pikachu VS Vigoroth}}\n|no={{tt|Borte bra, men Hoenn best|Away\'s good, but Hoenn\'s best}} {{tt|*|The title goes by the Norwegian adaptation of the original pun}} {{tt|**|In contextual translation the title goes by \'\'There\'s no place like Hoenn\'\'}}\n|pl={{tt|Nie ma jak w Hoenn|There\'s no place like Hoenn}}\n|ru={{tt|Нет места лучше, чем Хоенн|There is no better place than Hoenn}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Não há Lugar como Hoenn|There\'s no Place like Hoenn}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Não há Lugar como Hoenn|There\'s no Place like Hoenn}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡No hay lugar como Hoenn!|There\'s no place like Hoenn!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|No hay otro lugar como Hoenn|There\'s no other place as Hoenn}}\n|sv={{tt|Trubbel i Hoenntrakten!|Trouble in the Hoenn region}}\n|th={{tt|โทกะยิม! ปะทะ ยารุคิโมโนะ!|Touka Gym!
