However, Charizard escapes with ease as its flames scorch through the threads. {{an|Sophocles}} isn\'t fazed as he notices that Charizard is still paralyzed from an earlier {{m|Zap Cannon}} attack. He orders a {{m|Signal Beam}}, but Charizard uses {{m|Fire Punch}} on the ground to escape. The opponents exchange stares, and then, Vikavolt fires Signal Beam, which Charizard dodges. Vikavolt follows up with {{m|String Shot}}, though Charizard evades it. Vikavolt then chases Charizard and repeats its move, slowly covering its opponent in the threads. Charizard uses {{m|Slash}} to repel another String Shot. Vikavolt takes the opportunity to attack, but Charizard fires {{m|Flamethrower}}. Once it does so, Vikavolt has seemingly disappeared.\n\nA moment later, Vikavolt appears behind Charizard and successfully wraps it in String Shot. Declaring this to be the day he will defeat {{an|Kiawe}}, Sophocles has Vikavolt use {{m|Wild Charge}}, though Charizard manages to stop the attack with a Fire Punch. The pair subsequently dives into the battlefield from the collision. As the dust clears, Charizard promptly tosses Vikavolt into the ground. Charizard is beginning to show signs of exhaustion, but neither side are prepared to give up. Vikavolt uses String Shot, but it is forced to evade Charizard\'s Flamethrower. Kiawe builds up his Z-Power and passes it onto Charizard, who unleashes a powerful {{m|Supersonic Skystrike}}. Vikavolt attempts to intercept the attack with Wild Charge, and it manages to hold out against the Z-Move for several moments. However, Charizard\'s force overpowers Vikavolt and slams it to the ground, knocking it out. [[Hala]] calls the match in Kiawe\'s favor. Afterwards, Sophocles and Kiawe shake hands.\n\nSophocles and Kiawe visit {{an|Lana}} to cheer her up before her match [[Guzma]]. Just then, Guzma, [[Plumeria]], and several {{tc|Team Skull Grunt}}s walk by, and [[Tupp]] hurls an insult. Lana retorts that strength alone isn\'t always the key to victory, and Kiawe supports her. Tupp claims their Z-Moves are nothing compared to Guzma\'s strength, a sentiment echoed by Guzma himself. As Team Skull makes their way past them, Kiawe asks Lana to be careful because Guzma is rather unpredictable.\n[[File:SM134 Lana VS Guzma.png|thumb|250px|Lana facing Guzma]]\nFor the fourth match of the second round, Lana sends out {{TP|Lana|Primarina}} against Guzma\'s {{p|Golisopod}}. After remembering Golisopod\'s {{m|First Impression}} from [[SM115|Ash\'s battle with Guzma]], Lana warns Primarina to be on the lookout for it. As the battle starts, Lana braces Primarina for impact, but to her surprise, Golisopod remains still. Lana prepares to make the first move with {{m|Sparkling Aria}}, but Golisopod suddenly strikes first with {{m|Throat Chop}}, rendering Primarina unable to use its voice. Lana then has Primarina use {{m|Aqua Jet}}, but Golisopod blocks it with its arms. It then grabs a hold of Primarina before unleashing a series of {{m|Poison Jab}}s, [[damage|damaging]] Primarina and {{status|poison}}ing it in the process. Golisopod drops Primarina before Guzma orders it to pick it back up by the tail and hit it with another merciless series of Poison Jabs. Primarina manages to escape after blasting Golisopod with {{m|Icy Wind}}, but it is already debilitated by the poison. Golisopod continues attacking Primarina with more Poison Jabs despite the latter\'s attempts to defend itself. Golisopod momentarily releases Primarina from its clutches before hitting it with a Throat Chop.\n\nGuzma briefly looks at {{an|Professor Kukui}} before resuming the battle. Primarina stands up as Lana declares the battle isn\'t over yet. Guzma has Golisopod use {{m|Pin Missile}}, but Primarina summons {{m|Surf}} to stop the attack. Moreover, Golisopod\'s legs get stuck in ice from Lana\'s previous Icy Wind attacks, while Primarina\'s voice has seemingly recovered as it goes on to perform {{m|Oceanic Operetta}}. As Guzma declares that he will destroy the Z-Move, Golisopod\'s {{m|Liquidation}} slashes the large bubble in half. Primarina is then struck down, and Olivia declares Guzma the winner of the match. The crowd is shocked, with only the Team Skull Grunts cheering over the result. As Lana tends to Primarina, Guzma insults her and [[recall]]s Golisopod. Olivia asks Guzma to show respect for his challenger, though Guzma continues to walk away, only stopping momentarily to glare at Kukui.\n\nLater, Lana\'s friends visit her, as she is tending to Primarina. {{an|Mallow}} has {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Shaymin}} use {{m|Aromatherapy}} to cure Primarina\'s poison symptoms. Mallow is still annoyed by Guzma\'s violent battle style, and {{an|Lillie}} agrees. However, Lana explains he didn\'t break any rules, and Kiawe confirms that Guzma merely found a weak spot in Primarina. Lana admits that she is now more she determined to work harder to overcome future tough opponents. At the [[Pokémon Center]], the quartet of [[Nurse Joy]]s have healed Lana\'s Primarina, to which Lana thanks them. Suddenly, the television screen reveals the semi-final match ups: Kiawe versus {{an|Gladion}}, while Ash will take on Guzma.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
