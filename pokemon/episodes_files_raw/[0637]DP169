Heatran Rescue Mission!!\'\') is the 169th episode of the {{series|Diamond & Pearl}}, and the 635th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan as a 1-hour special on March 18, 2010, along with [[DP168]] and in the United States on October 16, 2010.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/tv-episodes/season-13/episode-11-13_11-pokemon-ranger-heatran-rescue/-->\n<i>Lake Valor is the site of the Grand Festival, and the next stop for Ash and the gang. But on the way, they meet a Pokémon Ranger named Ben, who’s trying his hardest to capture a rare Heatran. The members of Team Rocket want in on the action, too, and vow to catch Heatran for themselves. Shortly after all the commotion, Ben is found. He has crashed into a river, only to be rescued by a Feraligatr.\n\nBen asks our heroes for help in capturing Heatran. They agree, and they all set off in anxious search of the special Pokémon. But soon after they discover Heatran in a lava-filled cave, the cave begins to crumble, compelling Ben, Ash, and the gang to jump into action! When the Team Rocket baddies realize they are in over their heads, they hightail it out of the cave. After moves from Piplup, Buneary, and Buizel cool down the lava, a final Ice Beam from Feraligatr chills the lava enough for Ben to rescue Heatran and begin transporting it to the National Park.\n\nThanking our heroes for their assistance, Ben and Heatran board a helicopter for their destination, and once again the journey toward Lake Valor and the Grand Festival continues!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} are preparing a meal by a river. Meanwhile further upstream a {{tc|Pokémon Ranger}} named {{ra|Ben}} is trying to capture a {{p|Heatran}} which knows {{m|Eruption}}. Just before he could capture it, a small earthquake takes place making Heatran [[Escape|flee]]. Ben then catches a {{p|Pidgeot}} which is flying by and he uses to chase after Heatran. However as he finds Heatran so does {{TRT}} who use their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|RoboDiglett]] to break the boulders in order to stop Heatran in its tracks. It quickly escapes and one of the boulders hits Pidgeot and sends Ben plummeting into the river. He then calls upon a {{DL|Ben (Ranger)|Feraligatr}} to rescue him and take him downstream, which Feraligatr successfully does.\n\nBen then floats down the river to Ash, {{an|Brock}} and {{an|Dawn}} and introduces himself as a Pokémon Ranger. As he is talking with them he notices his [[Capture Styler]] is missing. He then asks them if they have spotted {{p|Heatran}}. Ben explains to them that it is a special one as it is the only one of its kind which can learn Eruption. He plans to take it to the [[National Park]]. Then he requests their help to which they gladly agree.\n\nMeanwhile as Team Rocket is walking down the stream they find Ben\'s Capture Styler and plan to use it to capture Heatran. Meowth then has a [[Boss fantasy|fantasy]] of the boss using Heatran as a grill, a {{wp|sauna}} heater and a fireplace.\n\nBen, Ash, Dawn, and Brock are climbing up a mountain. Ben then checks the temperature of the ground to feel if there are any volcanoes nearby. They keep going as Ben constantly checks the temperature which is getting warmer and warmer. They then approach a cave where the ground is especially warm due to the flow of magma and go inside it. Team Rocket then appears and follows them inside. As the group goes deeper inside the cave they find a lake of lava where they spot Heatran whose [[Ability]] {{a|Flash Fire}} activates.\n\nTeam Rocket appears again with their RoboDiglett and recite their {{motto}}. Then, James tries to use the Capture Styler but fails. Ben then says he\'s the only one who can use it. Meowth uses the RoboDiglett to try to capture Heatran, but Heatran stops it with Eruption. The cave wall is about to collapse and Heatran is in trouble. Ben bravely goes and helps Heatran, Ash and Dawn help him by cooling down the floor with their Pokémon. Ben takes the Capture Styler from James, but the floor under him crumbles and he almost falls into the lava. {{AP|Pikachu}} then uses {{m|Thunderbolt}} on Team Rocket and Meowth drops the RoboDiglett remote into the lava. Heatran then destroys the RoboDiglett with Eruption.\n\nHeatran is holding on to a rock that is falling into the lava, Ben then summons Feraligatr who uses Ice Beam on the lava. Heatran is saved then Ben captures it and they escape the cave as it collapses. Outside, Ben asks for a helicopter using his Styler to come by and pick him and Heatran up. He then shakes hands with Ash while the helicopter arrives. As the helicopter is leaving, he bids farewell to the group.\n\nThe scene cuts with the [[narrator]]\'s conclusion.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode. Only events pertaining to the series as a whole, such as captures, releases, Badge/Ribbon wins, etc., go here. -->\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} meet {{ra|Ben}}, a {{OBP|Pokémon Ranger|Ranger series}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n=====Main series debuts=====\n* {{ra|Ben}}\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n=====TV episode debuts=====\n* {{p|Heatran}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{an|Giovanni}} ([[Boss fantasy|fantasy]])\n* {{ra|Ben}}\n* Ben\'s grandfather (flashback)\n* Helicopter pilot\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Piplup}} ({{OP|Dawn|Piplup}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Buizel}} ({{OP|Ash|Buizel}})\n* {{p|Buneary}} ({{OP|Dawn|Buneary}})\n* {{p|Heatran}}\n* {{p|Pidgeot}}\n* {{p|Feraligatr}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* There is no [[Professor Oak\'s Big Pokémon Examination]] following this episode, instead being replaced by a trailer for [[M13|the thirteenth movie]].\n* Despite having being made a {{ra|Partner Pokémon}} by {{ra|Ben}} in the [[Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs]] specials, [[Ukulele Pichu]] does not appear in this episode.\n* Music from \'\'[[M05|Pokémon Heroes: Latios & Latias]]\'\', \'\'[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]\'\', and \'\'[[M09|Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea]]\'\' is used as background music.\n* At one point, [[Jessie]] calls {{Ash}} by his name instead of calling him a "[[twerp]]".\n* This is the only main anime episode featuring [[Pokémon Ranger (Ranger series)|Pokémon Rangers]] to not feature [[Solana]].\n* Similar to the previous two {{OBP|Pokémon Ranger|Ranger series}} specials (\'\'[[AG171|Pokémon Ranger - Deoxys\' Crisis! Parts 1]]\'\' \'\'[[AG172|and 2]]\'\', and \'\'[[DP071|Pokémon Ranger and the Kidnapped Riolu! Parts 1]]\'\' \'\'[[DP072|and 2]]\'\'), the English dub of this episode followed a different order than that of the Japanese version when first aired. Specifically, it aired between \'\'[[DP177|A Grand Fight for Winning!]]\'\' and \'\'[[DP178|For The Love Of Meowth!]]\'\', so as to be closer to the release of its respective Ranger game, in this case [[Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs]].\n** Unlike \'\'Pokémon Ranger and the Kidnapped Riolu! Parts 1 and 2\'\', this episode was returned to its original position in the season after the first airing. However, Pokémon.com still lists its placement in [[S13|season 13]] before \'\'[[DP168|Keeping in Top Forme!]]\'\' rather than after it.\n* Unlike the previous Pokémon Rangers specials, this was a standalone episode instead of a two-parter.\n\n===Errors===\n* When {{an|Brock}} says that normal {{p|Heatran}} cannot use {{m|Eruption}}, {{an|Dawn}}\'s hat has some strange lines.\n* In the {{pmin|Thailand|Thai}} dub, Ben calls {{p|Pidgeot}} "{{p|Pidgeotto}}".\n\n===Dub edits===\n* In the Japanese version, the [[narrator]] mentions during the opening and closing monologues that the gang are on their way to [[Valor Lakefront]] for the [[Grand Festival]]. However, due to the dubbed episode being postponed so it could air nearer the release of [[Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs]] (at which point {{ashfr|the group}} was now on the way to [[Sunyshore City]]), both speeches are changed so that the group\'s destination isn\'t mentioned.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FCC|bordercolor=99F\n|zh_cmn={{tt|神奇寶貝保育家！席多藍恩救援作戰！！|Pokémon Ranger!
