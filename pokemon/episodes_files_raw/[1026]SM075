Intense Lazy Training!!\'\') is the 75th episode of the {{series|Sun & Moon}}, and the 1,014th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on May 17, 2018, in New Zealand on September 6, 2018, in Canada on October 6, 2018, and in the United States on October 20, 2018.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/21_31-some-kind-of-laziness/-->\n<i>Thanks to Acerola’s help, Ash arrives at the Ruins of Abundance, home of the Ula’ula Island Guardian Tapu Bulu. Ash wants to train with Tapu Bulu to prepare for his rematch against the Island Kahuna Nanu, and after our hero demonstrates his friendship with his Pokémon, Tapu Bulu springs into action! \n\nShowing immense power, the Island Guardian engages Ash and Lycanroc in battle—and Lycanroc learns how to use Stone Edge! As the bond between Ash and Lycanroc grows, Tapu Bulu returns to its nap, satisfied that the training session was a success!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} rushes out of [[Acerola]]\'s home, eager to train for his upcoming [[Island challenge|Grand Trial]] against [[Nanu]]. {{Rotom}} directs Ash\'s attention to the [[Ruins of Abundance]], and are joined by Acerola and her [[Poké Ride]] {{p|Mudsdale}}. She has Ash hop onto Mudsdale\'s back and the group make their way to {{DL|Guardian deities (anime)|Tapu Bulu}}\'s location via [[Haina Desert]]. Mudsdale traipses through the sandy ground with great care while Ash takes in a mouthful of sand. The desert conditions send {{AP|Rowlet}} flying from the safety of Ash\'s backpack, fortunately {{AP|Poipole}} rescues it. They soon make it to the entrance of the Ruins of Abundance, though Acerola tells Ash\'s that they will have to climb a sharp cliff to reach Tapu Bulu. The ascent is an unexpected hurdle. Ash finds himself lagging behind as {{AP|Pikachu}} and Acerola leap along the cliff, while Rotom, Mimikins and Poipole fly up. In a bid to not be outdone, Ash speeds his way up the ascent and reaches the plateau before his own Pokémon.\n\nAsh sends out {{AP|Torracat}} and {{AP|Lycanroc}}, while Rowlet eagerly flies away. Acerola points out Tapu Bulu, who is resting near a lake. Ash and the others run towards Tapu Bulu, finding Rowlet happily perched on the Island Guardian\'s head. Ash requests Tapu Bulu\'s assistance for his training, but his request is greeted by snoring, much to his surprise. Rotom scans Tapu Bulu, providing further information on it. Poipole sprays the Island Guardian with blue sludge, causing it and Rowlet to wake up. Ash immediately apologizes as Tapu Bulu wipes itself clean on some nearby grass. Tapu Bulu flies up and begins to dig a trench into the ground with its horns. The display perplexes both Rotom and Ash, who watch as Tapu Bulu begins to plant seeds in its made trench. The Island Guardian lets out a cry and performs an attack that causes the new seedlings to grow into fully fledged trees, impressing Acerola. It then lies amongst the tree\'s leaves and begins to absorb their energy, as described by Rotom\'s data entry. Rowlet flies into the tree to rest, though find itself caught up in Tapu Bulu\'s now flowering display and becomes energised. To everyone\'s surprise Rowlet performs a new [[move]], {{m|Razor Leaf}}. Acerola believes that Rowlet was affected by the Island Guardian\'s mysterious powers. Tapu Bulu admires Ash\'s embrace of Rowlet while dark clouds and a few specks of rain begin to descend.\n\nNearby, {{TRT}} manages to seek refuge from the storm in a cave. As [[Jessie]] squeezes her hair to dry out, [[James]] looks outside as the gloomy weather continues. They huddle together, with Jessie finding the cave to be relaxing. {{MTR}} then realizes that they have become more comfortable with caves since living with {{an|Bewear}} in [[Alola]]. Jessie reassures him that the major difference is that they are free to do what they like and she calls out her {{TP|Jessie|Mimikyu}} for some [[Z-Move]] training. Jessie asks it to teach her how to pose, but Meowth and James doubt Mimikyu knows anything about its own Z-Move. Mimikyu perks up, and with a purple glow performs a series of ominous poses, which instantly alarms everyone.\n\nMeanwhile, Ash and his Pokémon play in mud and rain while Acerola, Tapu Bulu and Lycanroc watch from the cover of the trees. Tapu Bulu whips Lycanroc with its tail, sending the Pokémon to join Ash in the mud. Rowlet and Poipole soon add to Lycanroc\'s muddied appearance, only infuriating the Pokemon as its eyes turn red. Ash rushes to Lycanroc and holds its face in an attempt to calm it down. Lycanroc resists, but Ash reminds it of its days as a {{p|Rockruff}} when it enjoyed playing in the mud and rain. The recollection works, as the rainstorm stops and the sun again shines through. Lycanroc\'s eyes return to normal. It smiles and wags its tail as it embraces Ash. Lycanroc\'s change of heart and newfound control prompts Tapu Bulu to fly over and it challenges Ash, thrilling the young {{pkmn|Trainer}}.  \n\nAs the {{pkmn|battle}} is about to begin, Tapu Bulu rings its tail bell and changes the plateau using {{m|Grassy Terrain}}. Rotom reminds Ash that the attack powers {{t|Grass}} moves. The green atmosphere reminds Ash of the [[SM037|green flash when Lycanroc evolved from Rockruff]]. He encourages Lycanroc, stating that it has the powers of both the Midday and Midnight forms within itself. Tapu Bulu starts to attack and hits Lycanroc with a {{m|Wood Hammer}}, slamming it into the rock wall. Lycanroc is unscathed and responds with a {{m|Rock Throw}}. Tapu Bulu bats the attack away using an unrooted tree for defense. The show of strength shocks Ash. He watches as Tapu Bulu charges at Lycanroc with the tree and sends it flying into the lake. Anticipating Lycanroc to go berserk, Ash watches as his Pokemon emerges from the lake and walks slowly towards its foe. To his relief, Lycanroc just shakes itself dry, impressing Acerola and Ash\'s other Pokémon with its maintained composure. Rotom states that Tapu Bulu is about to unleash a {{m|Horn Leech}} attack. Lycanroc charges ahead with {{m|Tackle}}, though Tapu Bulu tosses its foe aside with its horns. Tapu Bulu follows up with a {{m|Solar Beam}}, but Lycanroc leaps out of the way and lands in front of Ash. To his amazement, Lycanroc is glowing with an orange aura and unleashes a new move, {{m|Stone Edge}}. Tapu Bulu anticipates the impact and retreats into its protective shell. The battle stops as Tapu Bulu rings its bell and claps its hooves together. According to Acerola, the display indicates that Tapu Bulu recognizes Lycanroc\'s strength, pleasing Ash and his Pokémon.\n\nTapu Bulu makes one of its trees sprout [[Oran Berry|Oran Berries]] and tosses them to Ash and his Pokémon as a show of gratitude. Ash and Lycanroc thank the Island Guardian for its training assistance as Tapu Bulu returns to its slumber. With his team\'s newly developed attacks and strengths, Ash declares that he is now ready to take on Nanu\'s Trial. As the group departs, Rowlet flies out of Ash\'s backpack and returns to resting on top of Tapu Bulu\'s head.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
