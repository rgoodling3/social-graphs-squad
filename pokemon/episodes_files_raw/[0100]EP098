Everyone Assemble!\'\') is the 98th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on May 27, 1999 and in the United States on April 8, 2000. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/02_43-a-way-off-day-off/-->\n<i>Ash and the gang discover a new island that is loaded with different types of fruit trees, and since the food there is free they decide to take a day off and give their Pokémon a little vacation. Unfortunately, Team Rocket doesn\'t take a day off from trying to steal Pikachu... will they catch our heroes off guard?</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} sail onboard {{AP|Lapras}}, but all of them seem bored. {{AP|Pikachu}} points to [[Unnamed island (EP098)|a nearby island]], which they mark as their destination. As they head for it, {{an|Jigglypuff}} surfaces nearby. They touch down in a cove as Pikachu and {{TP|Misty|Togepi}} run off while the humans take in the island scenery. {{an|Misty}} sends out her {{TP|Misty|Goldeen}} and {{TP|Misty|Staryu}} to play, along with Lapras. A piece of fruit suddenly hits Ash in the head, and they see a {{p|Farfetch\'d}} flying above them. A whole flock takes off from the island as {{Tracey}} sketches them. Pikachu and Togepi return with some fruit as Pikachu points to all the fruit trees. Ash and Misty take a bite of the yellow fruit, finding them sour. Tracey finds some darker ones that are riper.\n\nThe group decides to rest for the day on the island and sends out all of their Pokémon. Just then, as Ash is trying to interact with {{AP|Charizard}}, it uses {{m|Flamethrower}} on him. The attack also heads toward {{TP|Tracey|Scyther}}, but it deflects it with its scythes. The two then have a tense confrontation before it is defused by Ash. Meanwhile, {{TRT}} is also taking a vacation on the island. [[Jessie]] decides to not steal any Pokémon, but when she spots the group\'s Pokémon, they realize that Ash and his friends are nearby, and abandon their vacation plans in favor of stealing Pokémon.\n\nLater, Ash and his friends bring back fruit as {{AP|Snorlax}} attempts to eat the pile, but Scyther wards him away. Inside the pile, Jigglypuff pops out and {{m|sing}}s, putting everyone to {{status|sleep}}. As usual, Jigglypuff stops, gets angry, and scribbles on everyone\'s faces. When everyone wakes up, they decide to let Snorlax sleep longer while they continue preparing. The Pokémon enjoy their share of fruit as everyone realizes how much they need the vacation. Tracey brings fruit sandwiches to the table as Misty is curious about the new food style. Snorlax comes up, eats everything, and goes back to sleep, leaving everyone else to clean the dishes. Tracey notices that Snorlax doesn\'t eat as much now due to less energy exertion. Misty chastises Ash for not {{pkmn|training}} Snorlax.\n\nAt night, everyone is asleep, but Pikachu wakes up and notices that Ash is not there. He finds Ash on the beach, speculating about the [[GS Ball]]. Pikachu comes over and joins him in some stargazing. Ash then pulls out his two [[Badge]]s and remembers how different [[Cissy]] and [[Danny]] were as [[Gym Leader]]s compared to the ones in [[Kanto]].\n\nBack at the camp, Misty is awakened by Tracey\'s sleep-talking, but a {{m|Sleep Powder}} attack over the camp silences all but Charizard and Scyther. [[James\'s Victreebel]] stops sending the powder as Jessie fires a {{wp|bazooka}}, capturing everyone with suction plugs. {{MTR}} tries to reel them all in, but Snorlax is too heavy to drag. Scyther slashes the rope as Charizard steps up to aid. The powerful Pokémon roar battle cries, waking the camp and getting Ash and Pikachu to return. Team Rocket rappels in on a {{wp|zip-line}} reciting their {{motto}}, but they crash into a tree before they can finish.\n\nTeam Rocket sends out {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}} and {{TP|James|Weezing}} as Ash sends Pikachu. Weezing\'s {{m|Smokescreen}} covers the field, but Scyther\'s {{m|Swords Dance}} clears it and sends Weezing flying. {{AP|Bulbasaur}}, {{AP|Squirtle}}, and {{AP|Pikachu}} take turns using {{m|Vine Whip}}, {{m|Water Gun}}, and {{m|Thunder Shock}} to attack Team Rocket. Charizard follows up with Flamethrower as Scyther uses {{m|Skull Bash}} to send them blasting off. Ash congratulates the Pokémon as they watch Charizard and Scyther walk away in an informal motion of respect.\n\nThe next day, Ash brings out Lapras as everyone departs the island with refreshed spirits. Meanwhile, Team Rocket finds themselves stuck on a small rock island. They try to relax as a Farfetch\'d comes up, and the trio realizes that the small rock is holding the Farfetch\'d flock. The Farfetch\'d all proceed to smack Team Rocket with their sticks.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
