It was first broadcast in Japan on September 28, 2000 and in the United States on September 15, 2001. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/04_09-two-hits-and-a-miss/-->\n<i>On the way to Ecruteak, a renegade Tauros dashes past our heroes. Seeing an old man in Tauros\'s path, Ash and Bulbasaur battle the break-away beast. The old man is impressed with Ash\'s skill and asks him to come to his dojo. Ash quickly realizes the old man is looking for a new Shihan (master teacher) to take over, but the old man\'s granddaughter believes she will inherit the dojo, even though her method of training has more to do with fitness than fighting. Who will be selected as Shihan?</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} encounter a panicking {{pkmn|Trainer}} who has lost control of his Pokémon. The rampaging {{p|Tauros}} charges towards an unsuspecting old man. Before the old man can call on his Pokémon, Ash intervenes and tries to stop Tauros with his {{AP|Bulbasaur}}. The man watches intently as Bulbasaur uses {{m|Vine Whip}} to stop Tauros in his tracks, then it puts Tauros to {{status|asleep|sleep}} with a follow up with a {{m|Sleep Powder}}. {{an|Misty}}, {{an|Brock}} and Tauros\'s Trainer joins them. The Trainer thanks Ash for his assistance and recalls his Pokémon. The old man congratulates Ash on training his Bulbasaur very well and escorts them over to an urgent task he needs handled.\n\nThe elederly man introduces himself as {{OBP|Kenzo|EP166}} and he points the group to his fighting dojo where he is the current {{wp|Shihan}}. As they approach the dojo, the gang hears voices from the inside. They ask what is going on, and Kenzo replies that it\'s his granddaughter\'s stupid idea of training through dancing. After the door opens, Ash sees a {{p|Hitmontop}} dancing and checks him on his [[Pokédex]]. After the training is over, Kenzo\'s granddaughter [[Chigusa]] presents herself, and Kenzo informs her that Ash will be the new Shihan. Ash reacts surprised while Chigusa is angered and she retorts that she must be the new Shihan. Kenzo refuses to pass the title on to Chigusa because he considers her training strategy to not be due to serious, and he claims that she is teaching ballet than fighting. Ash then tries to settle the argue, while Chigusa challenges Ash to a {{pkmn|battle}} which will the decide the future Shihan. Ash replies he doesn\'t want to be a Shihan and he even doesn\'t have a {{type|Fighting}} Pokémon to battle, but Kenzo intervenes saying he should use Bulbasaur.\n\nAs Ash refuses again, an outsider called [[Shiro]], also known as the "Dojo Destroyer", appears at the entryway and challenges the current Shihan to a match. He declares his intentions, to earn enough respect to open his own dojo after already defeating 11 dojos. Kenzo accepts his challenge, while from the rooftop {{TRT}} spies on them, planing to steal Chigusa\'s Hitmontop. Next, the battle is up. Shiro sends {{p|Hitmonlee}} and Kenzo calls out his {{p|Machoke}}, but as it gets out of its Poké Ball both Kenzo and Machoke experience backaches. Chigusa offers to take her grandfather\'s place, and with the risk of losing their dojo\'s plaque, Kenzo agrees to the substitution. Brock takes his position as the referee and the battle restarts. \n\nThe battle begins with Hitmonlee blocking all Hitmontop\'s {{m|Rolling Kick}} attacks. Hitmontop then launches a {{m|Rapid Spin}} attempting to use {{m|Triple Kick}}, but Shiro predicts every hit, ordering Himonlee to dodge. Next, Hitmonlee hits his opponent with {{m|Double Kick}} followed by a {{m|Jump Kick}} and a {{m|Hi Jump Kick}}. As Shiro prepares to end the match, Team Rocket shows up releasing smoke onto the field. After the smoke clears, the two Fighting Pokémon are being caught in a net while Team Rocket recite their {{motto}} in {{wp|Ninja#Outerwear|ninja outfits}}. \n\nAs they are dragged into the [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|balloon]], Ash sends Bulbasaur to use {{m|Razor Leaf}} on the net, therefore releasing the Pokémon. [[Jessie]] and [[James]] reply by sending {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}} and {{TP|James|Victreebel}} respectively. Arbok uses {{m|Poison Sting}}, but Hitmonlee dodges the attack attempting to use Hi Jump Kick. Victreebel counters with {{m|Sleep Powder}} putting Hitmonlee to sleep. {{AP|Pikachu}} and Bulbasaur quickly dispose of Arbok and Victreebel, then Bulbasaur\'s Razor Leaf slices the balloon which blasts Team Rocket blasting off.\n\nAfter all that\'s happened, Shiro suggests that he and Chigusa should battle tomorrow as both their Pokémon are fatigued due to the intense activity they encountered. The day turns to night and the scene moves to the inside of the dojo where Chigusa expresses feels confident that she\'ll win the challenge. Kenzo informs her of a possible failure if she continues to battle the same way she did today. Then he turns to Ash for assistance, and he agrees to help train Chigusa. To help Chigusa prepare, Ash has his Bulbasaur compete in a practice battle against Hitmontop. Chigusa orders the first attacks, but Bulbasaur evades the onslaught. Then Hitmontop launches into a Rapid Spin and attempts to use Triple Kick, but Ash predicts every hit, ordering Bulbasaur to dodge the attacks. After all the successful dodging, Bulbasaur uses its vines to spin Hitmontop out of control, wrap him and then using {{m|Tackle}} to knock him out. Kenzo declares Ash the winner, and he proceeds to inform his granddaughter of the flaws in her style of battling. Chigusa realizes the mistakes she made and she apologizes to Hitmontop for her focus on how his attacks looked. Hitmontop reassures Chigusa, and the pair set their sights on becoming a stronger team and they proceed to train with Ash and Bulbasaur again. \n\nThe next day arrives, and the Chigusa\'s match against Shiro takes place again. Hitmonlee proceeds to use Rolling Kick, but this time Chigusa predicts his attacks and orders Hitmontop to dodge them. Next Hitmonlee uses Double Kick but Hitmontop manages to block his attack. Then, he attempts to use Hi Jump Kick but misses while Hitmontop launches into an improvised upright Rapid Spin attempting to use Triple Kick again. While he misses two times, Hitmontop manages to knock Hitmonlee with a third hit. Chigusa is declared the winner, and she is overjoyed with the result. Shiro is gracious in his defeat and bows to Kenzo as a sign of respect.\n\nSuddenly, Team Rocket make another unwelcome appearance, this time they show up with a boxing Meowth machine. One of the mecha\'s hands extends to grab Hitmontop, but Bulbasaur cuts it with Razor Leaf. Then the other hand proceeds to grab Bulbasaur, but Hitmontop kicks the flying glove away with Rapid Spin which sends it back to the machine. Then Pikachu uses {{m|Thunderbolt}} to blast Team Rocket off, destroying the machine as well.\n\nAs the sun sets, Ash, Misty and Brock are saying their goodbyes and heading on their paths once again. Chigusa apologizes to Ash for causing so much trouble, but Ash laughs it off and admits that he enjoyed his time. She then turns her attention to her grandfather and admits that she has a lot to learn. Kenzo declares that he is too old to continue training, but at Chigusa\'s insistence he agrees to teach her to become the dojo\'s next Shihan. Misty is thrilled for Chigusa, as she and friends make a final bow before continuing on their way towards [[Ecruteak City]].\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

However, Hitmonlee is Shiro\'s Pokémon, as Chigusa owns a Hitmontop.\n* At one point, Shiro incorrectly refers Hitmonlee\'s {{m|High Jump Kick}} as "Hi Jump Attack".\n* At the point where Kenzo explains Chigusa the weakness of Hitmontop\'s spinning, Hitmontop stands in front of Chigusa. But after it turned around to her and back again, it suddenly stands behind her without moving a single step.\n* In one scene when the battle resumes, one of Misty\'s shoes is colored green.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* In the original version, when Kenzo says he is the Shihan of the Dojo, Ash thinks a Shihan is a new-type Pokémon. In the dub, he thinks it is a Chinese restaurant dish.\n* The original airing of this episode on Hungama TV in {{pmin|India}} started the episode directly from the title card, skipping the part of the episode that comes before it.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|bg={{tt|Две попадения и един пропуск|Two hits and one miss}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|柯波朗對抗妙蛙種子，格鬥大對決|Hitmontop vs. Bulbasaur, Fighting Showdown}}\n|cs={{tt|Škola bojových pokémonů|The school of fighting Pokémon}}\n|nl={{tt|Twee Treffers en een Misser|Two Hits and a Miss}}\n|de={{tt|Dojo Träume|Dojo dreams}}\n|fi={{tt|Kaksi osumaa ja huti|Two hits and a miss}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Combat pour un dojo|Fight for a dojo}}\n|he=קרב של בעיטות{{tt|krav shel beitot|A Kicks Battle}}\n|it={{tt|I lottatori!|The fighters!}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Uma Questão de Honra|A Affair of Honor}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Duas Certas e Uma Errada|Two Hits and a Miss}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Equipo en batalla!|A team in battle!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Dos Pokémon Hits y una dama|Two Hit Pokémon and a lady}}\n|sv={{tt|Pokémon får sparken|Pokémon gets fired (Pokémon gets the kick, lit.}}\n|pl={{tt|Szkoła Dojo|Dojo school}}\n|hi=कौन बनेगा डोजो डोजो का शिहान? {{tt|\'\'Kaun banega dojo ka Shihan?\'\'|Who will become the Shinhan of the Dojo?}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n}}\n\n\n<br>\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP165 |\nprevtitle=Hassle In The Castle |\nnextcode=EP167 |\nnexttitle=A Hot Water Battle |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Johto | }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0166}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|166]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Shōji Yonemura]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Hisashi Shiina]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Tarō Iwasaki]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Katsumi Hashimoto]]\n\n[[de:Dojo Träume!]]\n[[es:EP168]]\n[[fr:EP166]]\n[[it:EP166]]\n[[ja:無印編第166話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第167集]]'}
