It first aired in Japan on October 22, 2015, in Canada on December 12, 2015, and in the United States on December 19, 2015.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/18_45-all-eyes-on-the-future/-->\n<i>The Double Battle between Ash and Olympia, the Anistar Gym Leader, is just beginning! Olympia’s powerful team of Meowstic, with their combination of Helping Hand (a support move) and Future Sight (a delayed attack), seems unbeatable. But once Ash recognizes Olympia’s strategy, things begin to turn around! He asks Pikachu to measure the timing of the Future Sight delay, and with that information, directs his Talonflame and Frogadier to send the Meowstic right into the path of their own attack! Ash claims the victory, and with it, the Psychic Badge!\n\nOur heroes then set their sights on Snowbelle City, where Ash hopes to win the last Gym badge he needs to enter the Kalos League...while Olympia warns of a future crisis that threatens the entire Kalos region!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} is at [[Anistar Gym]], ready for his [[Gym]] {{pkmn|battle}}. [[Olympia]] tells Ash to keep his eyes on the past to decide who he will be in the future as he battles. Ash replies he will gain his seventh [[Badge]] for sure. Olympia then takes out her strongest duo—a female and male {{p|Meowstic}}—for a [[Double Battle]] against Ash.\n\nMeanwhile, {{an|Professor Sycamore}}\'s assistants [[Sophie]] and [[Cosette]] are at the Anistar {{DL|Anistar City|Sundial}} looking at their broken equipment, commenting that Olympia will be obtaining them a replacement. {{TRT}} appear, disguised as a TV news team, and ask for their comment on the Sundial. Sophie replies that the energy given off by the Sundial is the same energy released during [[Mega Evolution]], at which Team Rocket exclaim together in surprise.\n[[File:XY093 Ash VS Olympia.png|thumb|left|250px|Ash facing Olympia]]\nAt the Anistar Gym, Ash\'s battle begins, as {{an|Clemont}}, {{an|Serena}}, and {{an|Bonnie}} cheer him on. Ash chooses {{AP|Frogadier}}, and Olympia asks who else he will choose. {{AP|Pikachu}} shouts out in eagerness, but Ash decides to use {{AP|Talonflame}} instead. The battle begins with the male Meowstic using {{m|Helping Hand}} and the female Meowstic using {{m|Future Sight}}. Ash commands Frogadier to use {{m|Aerial Ace}} and Talonflame to use {{m|Flame Charge}}, but the two Meowstic dodge using their psychic powers. The Meowstic then fly through the air with these psychic powers, and Ash tells his Pokémon to watch their movements carefully. Ash then commands Talonflame to use on Flame Charge on the male and Frogadier to use {{m|Water Pulse}} on the female.\n\nThe male Meowstic then uses {{m|Light Screen}}, which defends both Meowstic from the attacks, and then the female Meowstic attacks Talonflame with {{m|Dark Pulse}}, causing it to fall. Frogadier catches Talonflame safely. Professor Sycamore, who is watching on, comments to the group that the male\'s [[Ability]] must be {{a|Prankster}}, enabling support moves like Light Screen to occur before Ash\'s Pokémon can attack. Olympia then commands both Meowstic to use {{m|Psyshock}}. Talonflame and Frogadier try to dodge, but the moves follow them due to the female Meowstic\'s Ability {{a|Keen Eye}}. Both Pokémon are hit. Ash tries to counterattack, but Future Sight hits them with perfect timing. Ash then gets an idea and asks Pikachu a favor.\n\nAsh then commands Talonflame to use {{m|Brave Bird}} and Frogadier to use {{m|Double Team}}. The Meowstic counter with Helping Hand and Dark Pulse which destroys all the false Double Team images and forms smoke in the air. Frogadier then uses {{m|Cut}}, and the female Meowstic uses Dark Pulse, but Talonflame appears from the smoke to attack the female Meowstic. Olympia commands the Meowstic to use {{m|Thunder Wave}} against Talonflame, but it instead hits Frogadier who protects Talonflame. Frogadier falls to the ground, {{status|paralyzed}}.\n\nThe Meowstic then use Helping Hand and Future Sight again, and Pikachu starts counting using his tail. The two Meowstic then use Psyshock, and Talonflame retaliates with Steel Wing, deflecting the Psyshock with its wings. However, the deflected Psyshock still manages to curve back towards Talonflame but Frogadier blocks these in time by using Water Pulse. Talonflame spins and hits the male Meowstic with Steel Wing. Professor Sycamore then comments that [[physical move]]s such as Steel Wing are not affected by Light Screen. Ash commands Frogadier to use Aerial Ace, but Frogadier\'s paralysis stops Frogadier. The female Meowstic uses this opening to attack with Dark Pulse. Frogadier flies through the air and Talonflame catches it. However, Future Sight hits them in mid-air; Pikachu notes how long it took for the attack to take place.\n\nOlympia then commands the Meowstic to use Helping Hand and Future Sight once more, and Pikachu begins timing again. The female Meowstic uses Dark Pulse while the male Meowstic uses Psyshock, and Ash commands Frogadier to fly on Talonflame. Talonflame swiftly avoids the moves but the attacks continue to follow the two Pokémon. Talonflame then nosedives towards the two Meowstic before quickly dodging, causing the Dark Pulse and Psyshock to attack the Meowstic instead. Talonflame and Frogadier then grab hold of the Meowstic just as Pikachu warns Ash that Future Sight is coming. Talonflame and Frogadier throw the Meowstic into the Future Sight attack, which throws them down to the ground. Olympia then commands the two Meowstic to use Psyshock, and Ash commands Frogadier to use Cut. However, Frogadier stays paralyzed and Talonflame gives Frogadier a lift before the attacks can land. The Meowstic then again use Helping Hand and Dark Pulse, but Talonflame begins to retaliate with Flame Charge. The incoming Psyshock and Dark Pulse attacks hit Talonflame and Frogadier; however, Talonflame\'s Flame Charge wins through both attacks. Talonflame then speeds towards the Meowstic and hits the female Meowstic with Flame Charge. Frogadier\'s Cut narrowly misses the male Meowstic and Ash commands Frogadier to use Water Pulse. Frogadier begins to form the move, but becomes paralyzed again. The male Meowstic uses this opening to attack with Psyshock. However, Frogadier defends itself using the Water Pulse still remaining in its hands to divert the move. The Water Pulse then begins to grow until Frogadier launches the move at the Meowstic. Both Meowstic are now unable to battle, and Ash wins his Gym Battle against Olympia.\n\nAfter the battle, Olympia commends Ash\'s Pokémon, including Pikachu, and then states that she perceived great love during Frogadier\'s final move, and that Ash and Frogadier will achieve greater heights together. However, she also warns that if the two do not go forward with sincere purpose, great danger will await them. Olympia then hands over the {{badge|Psychic}} in honor of Ash\'s win.\n\nLater, Professor Sycamore asking Olympia what the danger was to Kalos she had perceived earlier. Olympia answers with \'\'"green fire... a flickering green flame... I saw it engulf Kalos and threaten to consume all of the people and Pokémon in that swirling fire... you will all play a substantial role in the chaos and turmoil... and every one of the [[Team Rocket trio|villains]] who tried to steal the sundial."\'\' Meanwhile, above in their {{DL|Team Rocket\'s mechas|Team Rocket\'s Meowth balloon|hot air balloon}}, Team Rocket sneeze and {{MTR}} suggests maybe someone was talking about them. At the [[Pokémon Center]], Ash thanks Professor Sycamore, who then hands Ash and Serena with a newly upgraded [[Pokédex]]. Ash decides to head for the [[Snowbelle Gym]] per Serena\'s advice. Eventually, Olympia senses another vision of deep green eyes.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:Ash Psychic Badge.png|thumb|220px|Ash holding the Psychic Badge]]\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
