While May is getting ready for her first opponent, Team Rocket lures her friends into a sealed transport container and sends them up, up and away with a Meowth balloon! But they didn\'t count on Drew being there to save the day. He frees Ash and the others, only for all them to then fall into one of Team Rocket\'s old-fashioned pit traps. While James and Meowth gloat, our heroes realize Team Rocket is working with Harley, and they have to get back to the Contest to help May.\n\nUp on stage, May and her Squirtle are preparing to face Jessie, who\'s disguised as Jessebella and using Harley\'s Cacturne. Below the stage, Harley and Team Rocket are preparing some more tricks when our heroes catch up to them. Harley points out that there\'s no rule against using someone else\'s Pokémon in a Contest, but his plans are foiled for now.\n\nMeanwhile, Jessie\'s initial delight wears off when even Banette can\'t easily win her the match. Banette gets annoyed by Jessie\'s complaints, and it looks like the odds are back in May\'s favor. But as time runs out, the two Coordinators are matched in points, and it goes into overtime! Jessebella is eager to win, but she\'s snapping at Banette and without a good understanding between Coordinator and Pokémon, it\'s only a matter of time before May wins and the ribbon is hers. Harley gives up on Team Rocket in disgust. May meets Drew and the two are looking forward to a match-up at the Indigo Plateau. As for Ash, he\'s looking forward to the Battle Pyramid!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Lilian Meridian|Lilian]] unveils the [[Mulberry City]] [[Contest Battle]] match ups, including {{an|May}} and [[Jessie]]. Backstage, "Jessibella" confronts May, almost revealing that [[Harley]] Is helping her to win. [[Drew]] walks down a corresponding corridor and happens to overhear May\'s conversation. {{Ash}}, [[Max]] and {{an|Brock}} wish May luck and exit the room as Drew moves backwards out of sight. The boys are approaches by [[James]] and {{MTR}} disguised as Contest attendants, who reveals that Ash received a call from home. They lead Ash and the others into a room, locking the door behind them to stop them from interfering with Jessie\'s Contest-winning scheme. {{MTR}} presses a button on his remote, causing the corresponding walls to collapse and reveal a steel box and balloon attached to the top. The balloon begins to inflate with air lifting the boys high into the atmosphere. James radios in to Harley, declaring the ploy a success.\n\nJessie\'s round is already underway as {{TP|Harley|Banette}} shocks the competition with a devastating {{m|Thunder}} to its opponent {{p|Noctowl}}. After a few moments, Noctowl is defeated and Jessie moves into the next round. Meanwhile, Ash orders {{AP|Pikachu}} use a {{m|Thunderbolt}}, but the attack only reflects off the surface, narrowly missing the boys. The metallic prison begins experience turbulence as an airborne {{p|Flygon}} directs the steel box to the ground with a {{m|Sandstorm}}. After a few moments, the box finally crashes onto the ground creating a giant plume of smoke and dust. The doors of the steel box begin to melt and finally collapse as Drew returns Flygon to its Poké Ball. Ash, Max, and Brock are stunned with the sight of Drew.\n\nWith a quick rotation of her hand, May releases {{TP|May|Squirtle}} with a flash of light. May\'s opponent doesn\'t hesitate to begin the battle with his {{p|Skarmory}} and its {{m|Steel Wing}} attack. As its wings glow a majestic color and begins its descent, Squirtle {{m|Withdraw}}s and begins {{m|Rapid Spin|rotating at a high speed}} clashing with Skarmory. Squirtle continues to attack with an {{m|Ice Beam}}, but Skarmory manages to evade the attack. Squirtle follows up with a {{m|Bubble}} attack as Skarmory attempts to counter with {{m|Swift}}. The countdown timer expires, and with the most points remaining, May advances to the next round.\n\nAs Drew leads Brock and the others to alert May to Team Rocket\'s grand scheme, they find themselves caught in a pitfall trap. James and Meowth promptly place a steel grid to keep the boys captive. As James and Meowth marvel over Harley\'s genius, Ash realizes that Harley is also part of the ploy. Brock calls upon his {{TP|Brock|Forretress}} and has it use Rapid Spin to free them.\n\nTwo solitary lights illuminate the Mulberry Contest finale contestants, May and Jessie. James and Meowth make contact with Harley directly underneath the [[Contest Hall]]. At Harley\'s request, James calls out {{TP|James|Mime Jr.}} and {{TP|James|Cacnea}} to dig underneath May’s feet. However, Drew and the others catch up to them and confront them with their allegations. Harley confesses that he has been helping Jessibella, or rather Jessie out. He reveals that he allowed Jessie to borrow {{TP|Harley|Cacturne}} and Banette for the Contest, something that isn’t against Contest rules. He stares Drew down for a moment before storming off with James and Meowth trailing behind.\n\nThe final round commences as May calls upon her Squirtle and Jessie releases Banette. Banette swiftly goes on the attack with a Thunder, landing a direct hit on Squirtle. A small portion of May\'s points are deducted while James, Meowth, and Harley examine the battle from overhead. Squirtle recovers from the attack and retaliates with an Ice Beam freezing Banette in place. After a few seconds, Banette breaks from the icy prison and responds with a {{m|Will-O-Wisp}} attack. While retreats into its shell to avoid damage, the colliding Will-O-Wisps create a sparkling display that impresses the judges. Banette launches another Thunder, though Squirtle counterattacks with a Bubble to land a hit on its opponent. Banette goes on the attack striking Squirtle with {{m|Frustration}} as Squirtle withdraws into its shell to protect itself from further damage. After a few moments, Squirtle goes into a Rapid Spin attack, tossing Banette off its shell. Jessie demands a Will-O-Wisp attack, but Squirtle continues to use Rapid Spin and dodges it by bouncing around the stadium. Squirtle evades the follow up Thunder and {{m|Tackle}}s Banette to the ground. As the two sides order another attack, the timer runs out.\n\nLillian turns her attention to the points, and notices that both May and Jessie are tied. She calls for Sudden Death Overtime, where there is no time limit and a Coordinator must reduce their opponent\'s points to zero to win. Banette strikes forward with a Thunder as Squirtle attacks with an Ice Beam. Though both Pokémon evade the attacks, reducing each sides points. Jessie orders a Will-O-Wisp, though Squirtle withdraws its shell and retaliates with a Bubble attack. May uses a combination, freezing Banette solid in ice before knocking it to the ground with a Tackle. Lillian rules Jessibella out for the count and declares May the winner of the Mulberry Contest. [[Raoul Contesta]], Director of the {{pkmn|Activities Committee|Contest Committee}}, presents May with her fifth and final [[Ribbon]], which qualifies her to compete in the [[Kanto Grand Festival]].\n\nHarley reprimands Jessie and her teammates for failing to damage May\'s chances, calling them "losers" before walking off. However, he admits to himself that it will be fun to defeat May at the Grand Festival. Later, May, with a document in hand, greets her friends and brother. Her attention soon turns to Drew, a surprising appearance. He is quick to leave, adding that he will see her at the Grand Festival at [[Indigo Plateau]].\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:May Mulberry Ribbon.png|thumb|220px|May holding the Mulberry Ribbon]]\n* {{an|May}} wins the {{ci|Mulberry}} {{pkmn|Contest}}, earning her fifth [[Kanto]] [[Ribbon]] and securing her a place in the [[Kanto Grand Festival]].\n* {{ashfr|The group}} learns that the Kanto Grand Festival will be held at [[Indigo Plateau]].\n* [[Harley]] takes {{TP|Harley|Cacturne}} and {{p|Banette}} back from [[Jessie]].\n* [[Drew]] is revealed to have earned four more Ribbons, thus bringing his total to five and qualifying him for the [[Grand Festival]].\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* [[Drew]]\n* [[Harley]]\n* [[Lilian Meridian]]\n* [[Raoul Contesta]]\n* [[Mr. Sukizo]]\n* {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s\n* Audience\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Mime Jr.}} ({{OP|James|Mime Jr.}})\n* {{p|Combusken}} ({{OP|May|Combusken}})\n* {{p|Squirtle}} ({{OP|May|Squirtle}})\n* {{p|Forretress}} ({{OP|Brock|Forretress}})\n* {{p|Cacnea}} ({{OP|James|Cacnea}})\n* {{p|Roselia}} ({{OP|Drew|Roselia}})\n* {{p|Flygon}} ([[Drew]]\'s)\n* {{p|Banette}} ([[Harley]]\'s)\n* {{p|Noctowl}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Skarmory}} (Coordinator\'s)\n\n==Trivia==\n* This episode establishes that when a [[Contest Battle]] ends in a tie, an \'\'extra battle\'\' with no time limit is held, which ends when one of the {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s reaches zero points, or when the [[Contest Judge|judges]] rule {{DL|Fainting|Battle Off}} for a {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}.\n* A karaoke version of [[I Won\'t Lose! ~Haruka\'s Theme~]] is used as background music.\n* A karaoke version of [[Face Forward Team Rocket!]] is used as background music for the preview for [[AG176|the next episode]].\n* This is the first time {{p|Skarmory}}\'s voice was dubbed since its debut in \'\'[[EP152|Hot Matches!]]\'\'.\n* This is the last time [[Jessie]] uses \'\'\'Jessebella\'\'\' in disguise after {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} found out her true identity.\n* The dub\'s title is based on the phrase "{{wp|go for broke}}".\n* {{TRT}} doesn\'t blast off or recite their {{motto}} in this episode.\n* This episode marks one of the rare occasions in which a member of Team Rocket refers to one of the main protagonists by name, with [[James]] telling {{Ash}} that he has received a phone call from home.\n\n===Errors===\n* In [[Jessie]]\'s first match in the [[Contest Battle|Battle Round]], the camera is overlooking the entire battlefield from a distance and there appears to be {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} on it, but in the very next scene there weren\'t actually any Pokémon on it yet.\n* [[Brock\'s Forretress]] is sent out from a regular {{i|Poké Ball}} instead of a [[Fast Ball]].\n* When {{TP|May|Squirtle}} uses {{m|Tackle}} on {{p|Banette}}, it deals damage despite it being a {{type|Normal}} move.
