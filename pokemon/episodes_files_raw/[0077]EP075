We find Ash as he\'s checking into the Pokémon Village where he\'s told his first battle will be held on the Water Field. Since Misty\'s specialty is water Pokémon she offers to let him use some of hers, but Ash declines. Professor Oak suggests that he not go into battle with Squirtle as his only water Pokémon and sends over Krabby as a back up. Against the advice of his coaches, Brock and Misty, Ash begins the battle by using his Krabby who\'s never fought before. </i>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter registering for the [[Indigo Plateau Conference]], {{Ash}} learns that he must first pass through four preliminary battles on four unique battlefields (Grass, Water, Ice, and Rock) to qualify for battling inside the Indigo Stadium. The lady at the registry has Ash go through a random selection, and he is assigned to {{pkmn|battle}} on the Water field later that day against a {{pkmn|Trainer}} named [[Mandi]].\n\nSince he is assigned to the Water field, Ash plans to rely on {{AP|Squirtle}} for the battle, but {{an|Misty}} suggests that it might not be enough. The group runs into {{Gary}}, who is battling on the Ice field. He mockingly wishes Ash luck as he wants to be the one to defeat him, and he walks away laughing with [[Gary\'s cheerleaders|his cheerleaders]]. At that moment, Ash receives a call from {{an|Professor Oak}}, who suggests he swap out one of his Pokémon. Ash decides to have {{AP|Krabby}} sent through to boost his team. Misty is worried because Ash had never used Krabby before, but Ash is confident in the Pokémon. Meanwhile, {{TRT}} is posing as a news crew and unsuccessfully trying to find rare Pokémon to steal.\n\nAsh\'s battle on the Water field soon begins, and he starts off with Krabby, while Mandi uses an {{p|Exeggutor}}. Krabby jumps into the pool, but Exeggutor uses {{m|Psychic}} to create a whirlpool, revealing Krabby\'s hiding space. Mandi then orders an {{m|Egg Bomb}}, knocking Krabby into the whirlpool and preventing it from using any attacks. Ash tries to recall Krabby, but the whirlpool prevents him from doing so. Suddenly, Krabby escapes from the vortex, and Ash orders it to use {{m|Vice Grip}} on Exeggutor\'s leaves, stopping its attacks. Hanging on tightly, Krabby uses {{m|Leer}} to immobilize Exeggutor, and its {{m|Stomp}} attack knocks it out. As it stands triumphant over Exeggutor, Krabby suddenly [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{AP|Kingler}}. Mandi, still confident, sends out his second Pokémon, a {{p|Seadra}}. Seadra uses {{m|Agility}} to dodge Kingler\'s {{m|Water Gun}}, but Kingler manages to slow it down with {{m|Bubble}} and then knocks Seadra out with {{m|Crabhammer}}.\n\nMandi remains undaunted as he sends out his last Pokémon, a {{p|Golbat}}. {{an|Brock}} becomes worried, since Kingler is weak against {{t|Flying}} attacks. Misty suggests that Ash should switch to {{AP|Pikachu}}, but Ash stands by his Pokémon. Golbat manages to evade Kingler\'s attacks, dealing a great amount of damage in the process. Ash then orders Kingler to use {{m|Hyper Beam}}. Kingler\'s shot hits Golbat dead-on, knocking it out and winning Ash his first Indigo League victory. Mandi is astounded by his defeat, with the commentator confirming that Ash successfully used only one Pokémon for the entire match. Misty and Brock watch on in shock as Ash jumps around, overexcited by his first win.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode. Only events pertaining to the series as a whole, such as catching and releasing Pokémon and obtaining Badges, go here. -->\n* {{Gary}} wins his first round match.\n* {{Ash}} uses his {{p|Krabby}} in {{pkmn|battle}} for the first time.\n* Ash\'s Krabby is revealed to know {{m|Harden}}, {{m|Vice Grip}}, {{m|Leer}}, and {{m|Stomp}}.\n* Ash\'s Krabby [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{AP|Kingler}} and learns {{m|Hyper Beam}}.\n* Ash\'s Kingler is revealed to know {{m|Bubble}}, {{m|Water Gun}}, and {{m|Crabhammer}}.\n* Ash wins his first round match against [[Mandi]] using only his Kingler.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* [[Ash\'s Kingler]]\n\n=====TV episode debuts=====\n* {{p|Seadra}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n[[File:Dare da EP075.png|200px|thumb|{{tt|Dare da?|Who\'s That Pokémon?}}]]\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{an|Professor Oak}}\n* [[Delia Ketchum]]\n* {{Gary}}\n* [[Officer Jenny]] (multiple)\n* [[Mandi]]\n* {{pkmn|Trainer}}s\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP EP075.png|200px|thumb|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Nidoran♂}} \'\'(US and international)\'\', {{p|Seaking}} \'\'(Japan)\'\'\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Togepi}} ({{OP|Misty|Togepi}})\n* {{p|Krabby}} ({{OP|Ash|Krabby}}; evolves)\n* {{p|Kingler}} ({{OP|Ash|Kingler}}; newly evolved)\n* {{p|Mr. Mime}} ({{Delia}}\'s, [[Mimey]])\n* {{p|Exeggutor}} ([[Mandi]]\'s)\n* {{p|Seadra}} ([[Mandi]]\'s)\n* {{p|Golbat}} ([[Mandi]]\'s)\n* {{p|Pidgey}} ([[Mandi]]\'s; multiple)\n* {{p|Pidgeotto}} (unnamed {{pkmn|Trainer}}\'s)\n* {{p|Raticate}} (unnamed {{pkmn|Trainer}}\'s)\n* {{p|Sandslash}} (unnamed {{pkmn|Trainer}}\'s)\n* {{p|Gloom}} (unnamed {{pkmn|Trainer}}\'s)\n* {{p|Venomoth}} (unnamed {{pkmn|Trainer}}\'s)\n* {{p|Tentacruel}} (unnamed {{pkmn|Trainer}}\'s)\n* {{p|Seaking}} (unnamed {{pkmn|Trainer}}\'s)\n* {{p|Moltres}} (flashback)\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[Professor Oak\'s Pokémon Lecture]]: [[Pokémon League]] participation\n** Pokémon senryū summary: If you win the league, be sure to praise them, your Pokémon.\n* This episode marks the first time when a {{type|Water}} Pokémon owned by Ash has evolved. The second time wouldn\'t occur until \'\'[[XY052|A Stealthy Challenge!]]\'\', 776 episodes later.\n** This also marks the first time when one of {{cat|Ash\'s Pokémon}} has evolved during a [[Pokémon League]] battle. The second time wouldn\'t occur until [[SM143]], where Ash\'s {{p|Torracat}} evolved to {{AP|Incineroar}}, 1,007 episodes later.\n* In the English dub, no [[gender]] for the "Who\'s That Pokémon?" feature was given, only "Nidoran". The picture and [[cry]] was of the {{p|Nidoran♂|male Nidoran}}.\n* Team Rocket\'s bogus news network was called "Lovely Charming Network", a reference to their Japanese {{motto}} where they introduce themselves as "the lovely charming villains".\n* The blurb on the present-day pokemon.com for this episode is mistakenly listed as the blurb from the episode that [http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/02_21-round-one-begin/ aired two weeks] before this one.\n* Team Rocket doesn\'t recite the motto or blast off in this episode.\n\n===Errors===\n<!--Do not add Brock\'s statement that Kingler is weak to air attacks as an error. He means that Kingler is vulnerable to attacks from the air, not that it is weak to Flying-types.-->\n* When a random Trainer is showing off his Pokémon to {{TRT}}, he holds up a {{i|Poké Ball}} containing a {{p|Raticate}}, yet a picture of a {{p|Venomoth}} appears. When he holds up the Poké Ball containing Venomoth, the next scene shows him staring at Team Rocket\'s camera, with his mouth not moving when he says "And a Venomoth!" in the dub. In the Japanese version he only showed off one Pokémon and a Venomoth.\n* When Ash used the video phone to talk to Professor Oak, Ash put the phone against his ear and used the screen when Ash\'s mom and Professor Oak only used the screen. \n* After Ash\'s Krabby evolves into Kingler, he looks at its Pokédex entry. The entry for Kingler states that "[Its] claws can pinch with the power of 10,000 horsepower". In fact, horsepower is a unit of power which is energy divided by time—not at all related to pressure. A better unit would be {{wp|pounds per square inch}}.  \n* When Mandi\'s Golbat used {{m|Double Team}}, it looked more like {{m|Teleport}}.\n* Right after {{Ash}} defeats Mandi, the black background of the big screen disappears when the screen changes to congratulate the winner.\n** This also happens after {{Gary}}\'s battle, therefore it may have been intentional and was simply changed in future episodes.\n* The move {{p|Seaking}} uses against {{p|Tentacruel}} is mentioned to be {{m|Horn Drill}}, even though it\'s actually {{m|Horn Attack}}.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[Pikachu\'s Jukebox]]: [[Together Forever]]\n* In the dub, after Mandi summoned a flock of {{p|Pidgey}} during his magic trick, {{MTR}} referred to the Pidgey as {{p|Pidgeotto}}. In the original version, Meowth doesn\'t name the Pokémon at all.\n* In the original, Gary says Ash is lucky to not be up against him, then speaks of a promise he supposedly made that Ash would lose, prompting Ash to question where said promise came from. In the dub, Gary says he\'d feel terrible if Ash lost, then tells Ash he wants the pleasure of beating him as a Pokémon Master. Ash then responds with a sarcastic remark about Gary\'s overconfidence.\n* Gary\'s comments on the battle to the news reporter are a bit more goading towards Ash in the dub. In the original, he just says he\'s relieved because everything went according to plan.\n* Brock saying he wants a chocolate shake in response to Ash and the stadium shaking is nowhere to be found in the original; instead he unconvincingly claims that he isn\'t nervous.\n* In the dub, during the battle on the Water Field, the announcer says that the battle is \'\'about to begin\'\', but one Trainer has two Pokémon remaining, and the other has one Pokémon remaining. In the original, he says it\'s about to end.\n* The PA makes [[Pokémon world in relation to the real world|a reference to a real-life event]] in the dub by saying that {{p|Exeggutor}}\'s {{m|Egg Bomb}} makes the scene look like the {{wp|Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July}}. In the original, he just says it looks like fireworks.\n* The trainer\'s book says that Trainers should conduct themselves with dignity and restraint in the dub. In the original, it says that the second round is two days later.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=AAFFAA|bordercolor=FFAAAA\n|zh_cmn={{tt|神奇寶貝聯盟開幕，水之場地！|Pokémon League Begins, Water Battlefield!}}\n|cs={{tt|První zápas|The first match}}\n|da={{tt|Første Omgang, Kæmp|First Round, Fight}}\n|nl={{tt|De Eerste Ronde!|The First Round}}\n|fi={{tt|Ensimmäinen kierros alkaa|The first round begins}}{{tt|*|The same Finnish title is also later used for DP174 \'\'Last Call — First Round!\'\'}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Ligue Pokémon : Premier tour|Pokémon League: 1st turn}}\n|de={{tt|Ring frei zur Runde 1|Ring clear for round 1}}\n|he=סיבוב ראשון {{tt|\'\'Sivuv rishon\'\'|First round}}\n|hi=पेहेला मुकाबला - शुरू! {{tt|Pehla Muqabla - Shuru!|First Battle - Start!}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n|hu={{tt|Az első forduló|The First Round}}\n|it={{tt|Quando si scatena l\'azione!|When the action runs wild!}}\n|ko=제1차전 물경기장\n|no={{tt|Klart for første runde|Ready for first round}}\n|pl={{tt|Runda pierwsza rozpoczęta|The first round began}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Começa o Primeiro Round!|The First Round Begins!}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Primeiro Assalto - Começar!|Round One - Begin!}}\n|ro={{tt|Runda Întâi - Începeți!|Round One - Begin!}}\n|ru={{tt|Первый раунд — Начали!|First round - Begin!}}\'\'\'\n|es_la={{tt|La primera ronda... ¡Comienza!|The first round... ¡Begin!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|¡Comienza la primera ronda!|The first round begins!}}\n|sv={{tt|Premiärmatchen|The opening match}}\n}}\n{{-}}\n\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP074 |\nprevtitle=All Fired Up! |\nnextcode=EP076 |\nnexttitle=Fire and Ice |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Kanto| }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0075}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|075]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Atsuhiro Tomioka]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Kazu Yokota]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Shigeru Ōmachi]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Yūsaku Takeda]]\n[[Category:Pokémon League episodes]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a main character\'s Pokémon evolves]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Ash]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a main character\'s Pokémon learns a new move]]\n\n[[de:Ring frei zur Runde 1]]\n[[es:EP077]]\n[[fr:EP075]]\n[[it:EP075]]\n[[ja:無印編第75話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第76集]]'}
