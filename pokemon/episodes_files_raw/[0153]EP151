It was first broadcast in Japan on June 8, 2000 and in the United States on May 5, 2001. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/03_46-the-totodile-duel/-->\n<i>Ash and Misty\'s friendly rivalry is tested when they both try to capture a Totodile at the same time. Unable to determine whose Pokéball had captured the wild Pokémon, the two must battle it out to determine the Totodile\'s new master.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}}, {{ashfr}}, {{AP|Pikachu}}, and {{TP|Misty|Togepi}} hold their [[fishing]] rods out in hopes of finding some Pokémon. Ash, however, is bored by this and gets into an argument with {{an|Misty}}. Suddenly, Misty gets something on her line and begins to reel it in, only for it to be revealed as a tea kettle. An enraged Misty pulls out [[Misty\'s special lure|her special lure]], then reveals that she grew up around {{type|Water}}s and thus wants to train as many as she can. Suddenly, a {{p|Totodile}} reveals itself to them, dancing on a rock in the stream. Ash scans it with his [[Pokédex]].\n\nAfter learning about the species, Misty declares that she intends to catch it, while Ash does the same. Before Ash can throw his {{i|Poké Ball}}, however, Misty tosses her lure at Totodile, who chomps down on it. Ash complains that it\'s not fair, and Totodile spits the lure out. Ash uses this as an opportunity to have {{AP|Pikachu}} attack it, using {{m|Thunder Shock}}. Now stunned, Ash throws a Poké Ball. Misty and Ash begin to argue again, but the Poké Ball does not hold, and Totodile pops out of it on their side of the riverbank. Ash complains and tells Pikachu to use Thunder Shock again, but Misty interrupts, throwing her own Poké Ball. This time, Totodile dodges it completely and uses {{m|Water Gun}} to blast the Poké Ball and the three {{pkmn|Trainer}}s into the grass. The three climb out, but Totodile is gone. Ash and Misty decide to both go looking for it. Misty tells {{an|Brock}} to watch Togepi, but Brock insists that he should come along since they\'ll need a referee.\n\nMeanwhile, Totodile is hungry, and notices {{TRT}} having a snack of [[rice ball]]s. {{MTR}}, however, complains that {{an|Giovanni|the Boss}} will be mad at them for their constant failures, and the other two attempt to cheer him up. [[Jessie]] offers Meowth a rice ball, but Totodile chomps on her hand instead. Meowth and [[James]] are thrill to see Totodile and hope to deliver it to Giovanni, but Jessie is more focused on getting her arm back. Totodile then goes on to eat the rest of the rice balls, and when Team Rocket attempts to intervene, it blasts them off with Water Gun.\n\nAsh and Misty finally locate Totodile, and both prepare to catch it. Misty decides to use her [[Lure Ball]] because of its better chance of catching Water-types, and Ash pulls out his own Lure Ball in anticipation. The two throw the Balls at the same time, and Totodile jumps as it is hit by both at the same time. The two Balls land behind a bush and Totodile is successfully {{pkmn2|caught}}, unseen by anyone. Due to the fact that both of them used a Lure Ball, no one can tell who threw it.\n\nAsh and Misty begin arguing again, and Brock stops them, saying there\'s only one way to decide whose Totodile it is: a [[Pokémon battle]]. The pair agree to a three-on-three match. Ash hopes that to prove that he would have won their [[EP007|last battle]] had Team Rocket not interfered, and he decides to use Pikachu against Misty\'s Water-types. Pikachu is ready to battle, however Misty has a secret weapon up her sleeve, her only non-Water-type Pokémon, Togepi. Pikachu feels very uneasy about battling against his friend, which isn\'t helped when Misty tells Togepi to hug Pikachu. Misty then has Togepi use {{m|Charm}}, which causes Pikachu to run from the battle and forfeit the round. Brock rules this to be a win for Misty, giving her an early lead.\n\nAsh decides to use his {{type|Grass}} {{AP|Chikorita}} next, as she also has an [[type]] advantage. Misty chooses her {{TP|Misty|Staryu}}. Ash opens the fight with a {{m|Razor Leaf}}, but Staryu avoids it and uses {{m|Swift}}. Chikorita responds with a {{m|Tackle}}. Misty commands a Water Gun, and nearly defeats Chikorita, but she digs in her heels. Ash tells Chikorita to use {{m|Vine Whip}}, but it misses as Staryu jumps again to use Tackle. With a quick [[move]], however, Chikorita evades the Tackle and tangles Staryu with another Vine Whip. Staryu’s central core begins to flicker and Brock gives Ash the second round. The match is now at one apiece, and it comes down to the last battle, both determined to win.\n\nAsh sends out {{AP|Bulbasaur}}, while Misty call on {{TP|Misty|Poliwag}} for assistance. As Poliwag\'s {{m|DoubleSlap}} and Bulbasaur\'s Vine Whip are about to collide the scene cuts to Team Rocket, who are now drifting downstream. The evil trio are still set on capturing Totodile for the boss, but their conversation is interrupted when their log hits a boulder. Jessie emerges from the water and spots the match between Ash and Misty. Meowth spots an opportunity, and the trio plan to wait until the end of the battle to take Ash’s group’s tired Pokémon away. Poliwag’s Water Gun breaks through Bulbasaur;s {{m|Razor Leaf}} attack, forcing Bulbasaur to jump out the way. Bulbasaur follows up with another Razor Leaf and lands a direct hit. Brock is about to declare Ash the winner, but Poliwag is soon enveloped in a white light and [[Evolution|evolves]] into a {{p|Poliwhirl}}. Ash scans it in his Pokédex, and then commands a Tackle from Bulbasaur. Poliwhirl uses {{m|Body Slam}}, and hurts Bulbasaur badly. Using Razor Leaf to get away, Ash asks Bulbasaur if it can continue, which it can. He commands a {{m|Solar Beam}}, which Bulbasaur begins to charge. Poliwhirl uses {{m|Bubble}} while the Solar Beam charges, battering Bulbasaur. Eventually the Solar Beam is fully charged, and Bulbasaur blasts Poliwhirl, making it unable to battle. Brock declares Ash the winner, and hands him {{AP|Totodile}}\'s Poké Ball.\n\nBefore he can celebrate, the [[List of Team Rocket\'s disguises|Pokémon Battler\'s Ladies Auxiliary]] shows up to congratulate them. A {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}}\'s appearance, however, gives them away as no one other than Team Rocket, who soon reveals themselves after their {{motto}}. Meowth declares their intentions, but Ash reveals that he has {{AP|Totodile}}, which bites off some of Jessie\'s hair. She sends out {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}} in anger, and tells James to send out {{TP|James|Weezing}}. Arbok goes after Totodile, but Totodile uses {{m|Bite}} and whips Arbok around to knock both it and Meowth out. Weezing uses {{m|Sludge}}, but Totodile avoids the move with its fancy footwork and uses {{m|Scratch}}, which sends it back into the rest of Team Rocket. Using Water Gun, Totodile sends Team Rocket blasting off again.\n\nHappy with winning, Totodile begins dancing with Pikachu, and Misty admits that she\'s not jealous that Ash beat her, but mostly because she has her Poliwhirl which listens to her rather than Totodile which is far too excitable for its own good. The group then continues their journey towards [[Goldenrod City]].\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
