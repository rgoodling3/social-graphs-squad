It was first broadcast in Japan on August 12, 1997 and in the United States on October 2, 1998.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/01_19-the-ghost-of-maidens-peak/-->\n<i>After leaving Acapulco in search of Saffron City, our heroes finally arrive at a small port town in the middle of celebrating a summer festival. In order to recover from their hard journey, Ash and his party decide to participate in the festival. Team Rocket\'s interest in the festivities, on the other hand, is purely monetary. Brock and James are both bewitched by a picture scroll shown in a shrine open only on the day of the summer festival. The picture depicts a beautiful young maiden in a scene from the legend of Maiden Rock—a point on a cape near the town. According to the priest\'s explanation, the girl in the picture lived 2,000 years ago, and awaited the return of a lover captured in battle, until she finally turned into stone. Every year at this season, the ghost of this girl steals the spirit of a young man and this year it is James\' and Brock\'s turn. What could the ghost possibly be after? And what is its true identity?</i>\n\n==Plot==\nTraveling by ferry from the holiday resort of [[Porta Vista]] to [[Maiden\'s Peak]], {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} find out that they have arrived in time for the annual [[Summer Festival]]. When they decide to go and enjoy it, {{an|Brock}} sees a beautiful girl, with flowing purple hair and a red flower, standing on a nearby pier. He immediately falls in love with her, but after being run over by a group of tourists, he notices that the girl has disappeared. {{AP|Pikachu}} is the only one that seems to notice that the girl, who is actually a {{p|Gastly}}, but Ash and {{an|Misty}} don\'t seem to notice her at all.\n\nMeanwhile, {{TRT}} follows Ash and his friends to Maiden\'s Peak. They come up with an idea to look around for dropped coins, and while pondering it, [[James]] sees the same girl Brock saw before, only by the water. [[Jessie]] slaps James to regain his attention. As they leave to look for the coins, James takes a final look at the dock, noticing the disappearance of the girl. During the festival, Ash, Misty, and Brock meet an old lady. She warns Brock that he should beware a young, beautiful girl who will lead him to a cruel fate. After the old lady insults Misty and Misty decides that they should be somewhere else instead of being insulted and drags off Ash and Brock with her. Meanwhile, Team Rocket puts their plan into action, though they do not seem to find anything. Then, James notices a penny lying on the walkway and goes to retrieve it, but is interrupted by the old lady, which Ash and company met just a moment ago. As in the case of Brock, she mentions the young girl to James. Then an [[Officer Jenny]] appears and takes the coin James found. When she suggests that they go down to the station with her to fill out a report, Team Rocket stammers that it is all right, they do not need to go down to the station, and then they flee the scene.\n\nBoth Ash\'s group and Team Rocket head for the Shrine of the Maiden. They see the shrine\'s greatest treasure, a 2,000-year-old painting of the maiden. Brock and James both realize that the girl in the painting is the same girl they saw before, and both attempt to approach the painting but are blocked by the man presenting the painting to the audience. He then tells the story of the maiden, who waited on the cliff for her loved one to return from the war, and eventually turned into stone. The two groups go to take a closer look at the aforementioned cliff, and {{MTR}} formulates a plan to steal the painting, with the intention of selling it for a lot of money, later that evening. As night falls, Brock is still at the cliff. Misty and Ash leave to enjoy the festival while Brock insists on staying at the cliff-side. When it is about time for the local [[Pokémon Center]] to lock the doors for the night, Brock still has not returned from the cliff, so Ash decides to go look for him, but [[Nurse Joy]] holds him back, giving Ash a short lecture on the importance of sleep.\n\nIn the middle of the night, {{MTR}} tries to wake up Jessie and James so they can try to steal the painting, but the two are not very eager to wake up. Suddenly a strong wind blows, and the doors of the Maiden\'s Shrine open. The ghost of the maiden floats out, causes Meowth to fall asleep and then wakes up James. She also shows herself to Brock, telling him that she\'s been waiting for him. Brock replies that he has been waiting, too. Ash and Misty start looking for Brock the next morning, while Meowth and Jessie search for James. Ash and Jessie then meet face-to-face and notice that they both are looking for a missing person. Jessie performs the Team Rocket motto all alone, but then hears James saying his lines. James and later Brock are thrown out of the shrine. As they all try to return Brock and James normal, the old lady appears again, reminding them of her warning about the ghost of the maiden. Ash\'s Pikachu shocks James and Brock, and the two finally revert to their normal selves. They all head inside, and the old lady states that all young men have fallen into the curse while passing through Maiden\'s Peak. They decide to protect themselves from the ghost by buying a large quantity of {{wp|ofuda}} or anti-ghost stickers and placing them around the shrine and the two cursed ones. However, when night comes, they note that the stickers do not work, and just like the previous night, the ghost of the maiden appears. Ash and others try to prevent Brock and James from being pulled out by the maiden.\n\nAfter being shot with a bazooka by Jessie, the ghost of the maiden summons several skull-like ghostly apparitions. Ash tries to identify them with his [[Pokédex]], but with no results. However, the Pokédex is still searching for one and when Ash points the Pokédex at the ghost of the maiden, it identifies her as a {{p|Gastly}}, who is impersonating the old lady as well. Since Gastly\'s disguise has been revealed, it transforms back to its normal form. Ash then challenges it to a {{pkmn|battle}}. Ash commands Pikachu to start the battle, but Gastly summons a living mouse trap to scare Pikachu off. Meowth states that mouse traps do not work on him, but Gastly summons a ball for him to play with, distracting him. Jessie then sends out {{TP|Jessie|Ekans}}, only for it to be scared off by Gastly\'s newly summoned mongoose. James commands his {{TP|James|Koffing}} to attack with the {{m|Poison Gas}} attack, but the mongoose puts on a gas mask and stomps Koffing down.\n\nAsh decides that it is his turn again and calls out {{AP|Charmander}}. Gastly summons a fire extinguisher, and Ash quickly recalls Charmander. He then summons his {{AP|Squirtle}} and {{AP|Bulbasaur}}, but Gastly summons a {{p|Venusaur}} and a {{p|Blastoise}}, which causes Ash\'s Pokémon to become too scared to do anything, and just because it thinks it is fun, it combines them into a hybrid called "Venustoise". After repeatedly being beaten by Gastly, Misty tries another strategy. She uses a cross, garlic, a stake, and a hammer, comparing Gastly to a vampire. However, the sun starts to rise once again, and as Gastly hates sunlight, it disappears, saying that the ghost of the maiden and the old woman will return for next year\'s festival. On the following night, the festival continues, with lantern boats sent out to sea to help guide any wandering spirits. Ash and his friends have fun, and everything is back to normal. As the episode ends, the true ghost of the maiden emerges from her stone self, thanking Gastly for keeping her legend alive and hoping her true love will return.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

The second is \'\'[[EP095|A Shipful of Shivers]]\'\'.\n* The kanji on the fire extinguisher Gastly uses to extinguish Ash\'s Charmander\'s tail flame was left unedited in the dub.\n* In the {{pmin|the Arab world|Arabic}} [[dub]], this episode was removed for unknown reasons, likely because of the extensive representation of Shinto religious elements in ways that are against Islamic culture. It was also removed from the {{pmin|South Korea|Korean dub}}.\n* The festival in this episode bears a striking resemblance to the one from the 1993 OVA \'\'{{wp|Mega Man: Upon a Star}}\'\'. However, in this festival, there is no Whack-a-Mole.\n* This is the first episode to show a real {{OBP|ghost|literal}}, as the true spirit of the Maiden speaks with Gastly near the end.\n\n===Errors===\n* James commands his {{TP|James|Koffing}} to use {{m|Poison Gas}}, which Koffing could [[Anime move errors|not legally learn]] in a [[Generation I]] game unless it was [[trade]]d back from [[Generation II]]. At the time of the episode\'s original airing, no Generation II game had been released yet, meaning that at the time of this episode airing, Koffing was completely unable to learn Poison Gas by any means.\n* When Ash says "We lose. It\'s just too strong.", the red part that adjusts the size of [[Ash\'s hat|his hat]] is white.\n\n<gallery>\nEP020 Error.png|Ash\'s miscolored hat\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[PokéRap]]: Day 5 (Version 2)\n* The fan that Misty held had its kanji erased.\n* Misty (or, at least, someone who sounded suspiciously like her) shouted "Let\'s go to the ferris wheel!" twice in the scene; specifically, right up to the part where Brock says "She was the most beautiful girl I\'ve ever seen...".\n* James finds a United States penny on the ground which was originally a ¥5 coin in the Japanese version. However, the ¥1000 and ¥5000 bills in the old woman\'s cash register were left unchanged.\n* James mentions the F.B.I when he encounters [[Officer Jenny]].\n* The {{wp|o-fuda}} they wear are referred to as "anti-ghost stickers" in the dub.\n* Brock\'s "Hey! Let me go!" line in the dub was actually "You guys...!" in the Japanese version. The original version implied that Brock was in a trance and his friends broke the trance.\n* Ash says that, since Gastly is a Pokémon, he can battle it with his Pokémon in the Japanese version.\n* The ball that {{MTR}} was playing with had the word "Matatabi", meaning "catnip", which was erased from the dub.\n* The mongoose says "mongoose" in the vein of a Pokémon in the original version instead of "Dinner time!".\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=AFA|bordercolor=FAA\n|zh_cmn={{tt|幽靈神奇寶貝和夏天廟會 / 幽灵神奇宝贝跟夏天庙会|Ghostly Pokémon and the Summer Festival}}\n|cs={{tt|Duch Dívčího útesu|The ghost of the Maiden Cliff}}\n|da={{tt|Spøgelset På Ungmøens Klint|The Ghost on Maiden\'s Peak}}\n|nl={{tt|De Geest van Maiden\'s Peak|The Ghost of Maiden\'s Peak}}\n|fi={{tt|Neidonkallion aave|The ghost of the Maiden\'s Rock}}\n|fr_ca={{tt|Le fantôme de la jeune fille|The ghost of the young girl}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Le fantôme de la jeune fille|The ghost of the young girl}}\n|de={{tt|Die verlorene Seele|The lost soul}}\n|he=אגדת העלמה והרוח {{tt|\'\'Agadat ha\'alma ve\'ha\'ruhakh\'\'|The legend of the maiden and the ghost}}\n|hi=द घोस्ट ऑफ मईडेन\'स पीक {{tt|\'\'The Ghost of Maiden\'s Peak\'\'|The Ghost of Maiden\'s Peak}} {{tt|*|CN dub}} <br> मईडेन पीक का भूत {{tt|\'\'Maiden Peak ka Bhoot\'\'|Ghost of Maiden Peak}} {{tt|*|Hungama Dub}}\n|hu={{tt|A Hajadon-fok kísértete|The Ghost of the Maiden Cliff}}\n|it={{tt|Il fantasma della scogliera|The ghost of the peak}}{{tt|*|Original 2000 dub}} <br> {{tt|Il fantasma del promontorio|The ghost of the reef}}{{tt|*|2014 K2 TV dub}}\n|no={{tt|Spøkelset fra Maiden\'s Peak|The ghost from Maiden\'s Peak}}\n|pl={{tt|Duch z Dziewiczej Góry|The Ghost of Maiden\'s Peak}}\n|pt_br={{tt|O Fantasma do Pico da Donzela|The Ghost of the Maiden\'s Peak}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|O Fantasma do Pico da Donzela|The Ghost of the Maiden\'s Peak}}\n|ro={{tt|Fantoma Fecioarei de pe Stâncă|The Maiden\'s Ghost from the Cliff}}\n|ru={{tt|Призрак Девичьей скалы|The ghost of Maiden Cliff}}\n|sr={{tt|Дух девојчиног врха|The Ghost of Maiden\'s Peak}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡El Fantasma del Pico de la Doncella!|The Ghost of Maiden\'s Peak!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|El fantasma de Maiden\'s Peak|The ghost of Maiden\'s Peak}}\n|sv={{tt|Spöket vid Maiden\'s Peak|The Ghost at Maiden\'s Peak}}{{tt|*|Pokémon TV, spoken title}}<br>{{tt|Spöket på Jungfruklippan|The ghost on Maiden\'s Peak}}{{tt|*|VHS release}}\n|tr={{tt|Kız Tepesi Hayaleti|Maiden Hill\'s Ghost}}\n|uk={{tt|Привид Дівочої Скелі|Ghost of Maiden\'s Cliff}}\n|vi={{tt|Oan hồn trong ngôi làng|The Maiden\'s Ghost from the Cliff}}\n}}\n{{-}}\n\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP019 |\nprevtitle=Tentacool & Tentacruel |\nnextcode=EP021 |\nnexttitle=Bye Bye Butterfree |\nseries=original series |\ncolorscheme=Kanto}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0020}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|020]]\n[[Category:Banned episodes]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Takeshi Shudō]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded and directed by Kiyotaka Itani]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Kiyotaka Itani]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Kiyotaka Itani]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Takayuki Shimura]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Brock]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on James]]\n\n[[de:Die verlorene Seele]]\n[[es:EP020]]\n[[fr:EP020]]\n[[it:EP020]]\n[[ja:無印編第20話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第20集]]'}
