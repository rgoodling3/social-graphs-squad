It first aired in Japan on November 4, 1997 and in the United States on October 20, 1998.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/01_31-the-ninja-poke-showdown/-->\n<i>Fuchsia Gym, the authorized gym where Ash seeks his next badge, turns out to be a hidden ninja\'s lair. After finally discovering and entering the gym, he is held up by a complex system of traps. At last, the gym\'s eccentric trainer challenges Ash to a match. Just as he defeats the trainer, the official battle with the Master begins. The battle goes out of control as Team Rocket also enters the gym and its vast array of traps. Can Ash actually earn the gym badge?</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}}, {{an|Misty}}, and {{an|Brock}} find themselves lost in a forest en route to the [[Fuchsia Gym]] and decide to take a break by a waterfall. Brock brushes {{TP|Brock|Vulpix}} and comments on its wonderful hair, whilst {{TP|Misty|Psyduck}} takes a sip of water. Misty tells Psyduck that drinking cold water will only make its headache worse, but Psyduck\'s responds with a blank stare, which angers her. She then asks Brock if he would like to trade Vulpix for Psyduck, though he refuses. As they head off for the Gym, a {{p|Venonat}} watches them from the trees.\n\nAs Ash and {{ashfr}} continue walking, they end up at an odd-looking mansion where they stop to ask directions, though it appears to be deserted. Misty leans against a wall and falls through it. Brock knocks on the wall and it is revealed to be a secret door, in which they quickly locate Misty. Suddenly, the same {{p|Venonat}} that was spying on them before appears. It hops away, so they decide to follow it. However, Ash runs into a small series of mishaps, such as being electrocuted by a {{p|Voltorb}}, colliding into an invisible wall, nearly falling off a ledge because of a wall trap, and being pinned to another wall by several {{wp|shuriken|throwing stars}}. Then, a girl, who identifies herself as ninja warrior {{an|Aya}}, jumps from the ceiling. Though Ash and Misty criticize Aya\'s dangerous traps, Brock is smitten and compliments Aya\'s outfit. However, she slaps his hand away and pushes him to the ground before claiming that she will not let the group go until she and Ash have a {{pkmn|battle}}; he accepts the one-on-one match.\n\nAya sends out Venonat and Ash chooses {{AP|Bulbasaur}}. Bulbasaur uses {{m|Tackle}}, but Venonat jumps on its head and launches a {{m|Stun Spore}} attack, which Bulbasaur deflects with {{m|Whirlwind}}. It then replies with its {{m|Vine Whip}}, though Venonat evades it and scores a direct hit with its {{m|Psybeam}}. Bulbasaur then finishes it off with {{m|Leech Seed}} before its vines quickly entangle the Pokémon and drain it of its energy. Aya returns Venonat, just as a Voltorb appears and uses {{m|Self-Destruct}}, filling the room with smoke. [[Koga]] appears, explains that they are at the [[Fuchsia Gym]], reveals that he is the [[Gym Leader]], introduces Aya as his younger sister, and announces that he will battle Ash and not let the group go until he does. Ash states his intentions of wanting to find the Gym and challenge Koga, and Koga shows him a {{badge|Soul}} that he can earn by defeating him. Ash sends in {{AP|Pidgeotto}}, and Koga responds by sending out his own Venonat, which promptly [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Venomoth}}. Koga orders Venomoth to use Stun Spore, and Ash orders Pidgeotto to use Whirlwind. This time, however, the Stun Spore paralyzes Pidgeotto. Venomoth then follows up with {{m|Sleep Powder}}, prompting Ash to recall Pidgeotto and send out {{AP|Charmander}}. Venomoth uses Stun Spore again, but Charmander blocks it with {{m|Flamethrower}}.\n\nAt that point, {{TRT}} arrives on the scene and performs a theatrical {{wp|kabuki}} rendition of their {{motto}}, sending out {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}} and {{TP|James|Weezing}} in the process. Ash, Aya, and Koga send in Charmander, Venonat, and Venomoth, respectively, to battle, but James throws a fistful of a sticky thread at them, immobilizing them. Pikachu then steps up, only to meet the same fate from Jessie. Misty then tries to send out Starmie, but Psyduck breaks out of its {{i|Poké Ball}} instead. An infuriated Misty asks Ash what moves Psyduck knows; Ash consults the Pokédex, which lists {{m|Tail Whip}}. Misty tells Psyduck to use Tail Whip, but Psyduck wags its tail to no effect whatsoever. The Pokédex then lists Psyduck\'s second move as {{m|Scratch}}, which Psyduck does use on Arbok, but it doesn\'t work. Arbok begins biting Psyduck\'s head, worsening its headache.\n\nKoga then pulls a cord, opening up several ceiling panels and unleashing a large amount of Voltorb on the trio. However, Team Rocket uses more of their sticky thread to reel in the entire pack of Voltorb. Brock then notices that the room is slanted, and Koga explains that it is a strategy to confuse any opponents. Team Rocket breaks through a wall, with the Voltorb stuffed in a loot bag. Meowth bowls a Voltorb towards Ash and his friends, and it explodes. Ash attempts to retaliate, though his Pokemon are still entangled in Team Rocket\'s sticky web. When Psyduck runs frantically through the scene, Meowth hits Psyduck out of the way, agitated by its chaotic behavior. At that moment, Psyduck uses a variety of {{t|Psychic}} powers to freeze Team Rocket; blast them off; and remove the sticky gunk from Venonat, Venomoth, Charmander, and Pikachu. Ash\'s Pokédex chimes in, identifying Psyduck\'s third and fourth attacks as {{m|Disable}} and {{m|Confusion}}. Koga and Aya both offer to trade for Psyduck, but Misty declines, saying she wouldn\'t trade Psyduck for the world.\n\nAsh and Koga resume their battle outside. Koga\'s {{p|Golbat}} makes the first move, swooping on Ash\'s Charmander with a {{m|Wing Attack}}. Charmander keeps Golbat away with its {{m|Ember}} attack, though Koga responds with {{m|Screech}}. Despite the high frequency, Charmander launches a series of Flamethower attacks, burning Brock\'s face and Golbat\'s wing in the process. Charmander then wins the battle with an intense {{m|Fire Spin}}. Koga promptly gives Ash a Soul Badge in recognition of Charmander\'s battle skill alongside Psyduck\'s efforts for saving the Gym and his Voltorb from Team Rocket, and the trio goes on their way.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

Fuchsia City itself would not appear until almost 400 episodes later in \'\'[[AG157|Time Warp Heals All Wounds]]\'\'.\n* This episode was banned in {{pmin|South Korea}}, likely because of references to Japanese culture.\n* Parts of this episode were reanimated and used for flashback material for \'\'[[BW116|The Fires of a Red-Hot Reunion!]]\'\'.\n\n===Errors===\n* {{Ash}} commands his {{AP|Bulbasaur}} to use {{m|Whirlwind}}, though in the games, Bulbasaur [[Anime move errors|cannot legitimately know this move]].\n** This was most likely a dubbing error, since Whirlwind is known as \'\'\'ふきとばし\'\'\' \'\'Blow Away\'\' in Japanese. Ash was most likely telling Bulbasaur to simply "blow it away" rather than the actual attack.\n* Koga has his Venomoth attack [[Ash\'s Pidgeotto]] with {{m|Stun Spore}} and {{m|Sleep Powder}}, which {{status|Paralysis|paralyze}} it and put it to sleep, respectively. However, no Pokémon can have more than one major [[status condition]] on it at the same time.\n* Ash instructs his Pikachu to use "electric attack", which does not exist, while in the Japanese version he instructs it to use {{m|Thunder Shock|ThunderShock}}. This is most likely a translation error, as ThunderShock\'s Japanese name \'\'\'でんきショック\'\'\' means \'\'Electric Shock\'\'.\n* Even though Ash is stuck to the wall by the throwing stars, when the camera changes to show the side of Ash\'s face and sleeve, the stars are missing.\n* The Pokédex classifies {{p|Venonat}} as the Bug Pokémon instead of the \'\'Insect\'\' Pokémon.\n* In the shot right after Team Rocket performs their motto, Ash\'s gloves are completely black.\n* When Ash and his friends enter the slanted trap room in the mansion, there are many errors. First, the wall design differs between shots as well as the wall design to Brock\'s right. Third, the back wall is sloped, but appears normal in the next.\n* After Team Rocket blasts off, the room isn\'t slanted anymore.\n* When Koga gives Ash his Soul Badge, it is perpendicular and rounder. However, when Koga unrolls it earlier, the badge was pointing away from the top.\n* In the Swedish dub after obtaining the Soul Badge Ash\'s English voice can be heard.\n* The Pokédex lists Psyduck\'s attacks in the incorrect order and leaves out two, Fury Swipes and Hydro Pump.\n\n<gallery>\nAsh Bulbasaur Whirlwind.png|Ash\'s Bulbasaur using Whirlwind\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[PokéRap]]: Day 2\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=AFA|bordercolor=FAA\n|zh_cmn={{tt|淺紅道館的忍者決鬥 / 浅红道馆的忍者决斗|Qiǎnhóng (Fuchsia) Gym\'s Ninja Showdown}}\n|cs={{tt|Zápas s ninjou|Battle with ninja}}\n|da={{tt|Dysten I Ninjatemplet|Contest in Ninja Temple}}\n|nl={{tt|De Ninja Poké-Demonstratie|The Ninja Poké-Demonstration}}\n|fi={{tt|Ninjojen ja Pokémonien välienselvittely|The showdown of ninjas and Pokémon}}\n|fr_ca={{tt|Le Ninja Pokémon|The Pokémon Ninja}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Le Ninja Pokémon|The Pokémon Ninja}}\n|de={{tt|Die Arena der Ninjas|The gym of the ninjas}}\n|he=קרב הנינג\'ה {{tt|\'\'Krav ha\'ninja\'\'|The ninja battle}}\n|hi=निंजा पोकेमोन मैच {{tt|\'\'Ninja Pokémon Match\'\'|Ninja Pokémon Match}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n|hu={{tt|A nindzsa Pokéiskola|The Ninja Poké-school}}\n|it={{tt|La villa dei ninja|The ninja villa}}{{tt|*|Original 2000 dub}} <br> {{tt|Un covo di ninja|A den of ninjas}}{{tt|*|2014 K2 TV dub}}\n|no={{tt|Ninja Pokémon-oppgjør|Ninja Pokémon showdown}}\n|pl={{tt|Rycerze poke-ninja|Poké-ninja knights}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Os Poderes do Poké-Ninja|The Poké-Ninja\'s Powers}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|O Confronto do Pokémon Ninja|Pokémon Ninja Confrontation}}\n|ro={{tt|Confruntarea Poké-ninja|The Poké-ninja Showdown}}\n|ru={{tt|Бой с покемоном-ниндзя|The battle with Pokémon-ninja}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡El duelo Pokémon ninja!|The ninja Pokémon duel!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|El Pokenfrentamiento ninja|The ninja Poké-battle}}<br>{{tt|El Poké-enfrentamiento ninja|The ninja Poké-battle}}{{tt|*|Pokémon TV}}\n|sv={{tt|Ninjaherrgården|The ninja mansion}}{{tt|*|Pokémon TV, spoken title}}<br>{{tt|Poké-Ninja utmanar|Poké-Ninja chalenges}}{{tt|*|VHS release}}\n}}\n{{-}}\n\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP031 |\nprevtitle=Dig Those Diglett! |\nnextcode=EP033 |\nnexttitle=The Flame Pokémon-athon! |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Kanto}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0032}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|032]]\n[[Category:Banned episodes]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Yukiyoshi Ōhashi]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded and directed by Kiyotaka Itani]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Kiyotaka Itani]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Kiyotaka Itani]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Takayuki Shimura]]\n[[Category:Episodes with Gym battles]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which Ash gets a Badge]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Ash]]\n[[Category:Banned episodes]]\n\n[[de:Die Arena der Ninjas]]\n[[es:EP032]]\n[[fr:EP032]]\n[[it:EP032]]\n[[ja:無印編第32話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第32集]]'}
