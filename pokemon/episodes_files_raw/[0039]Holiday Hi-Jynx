It was first broadcast in Japan on October 5, 1998, along with \'\'[[Snow Way Out!]]\'\', and in the United States on December 11, 1999. It was initially intended to be the 39th episode of the Pokémon anime, airing in Japan on December 23, 1997, but was rescheduled following the [[EP038]] incident.\n\nOn December 23, 2012, the 15th anniversary of the episode\'s originally-planned broadcast date, it aired on [[Pokémon Smash!]] and was edited to make all of the {{p|Jynx}}\'s skin purple instead of black. This version has not been dubbed, so it is still banned in the United States. The Japanese versions of [[Amazon]] and [[Netflix]] have the edited version while [[Hulu]] has the original version.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/02_10-holiday-hi-jynx/-->\n<i>Ash and his friends run into a scared and lonely Jynx who has a boot belonging to Santa Claus but can\'t find its way to the North Pole. Team Rocket is convinced that Jynx really is Santa Claus and Jessie wants revenge from something that happened in her childhood. Can Ash beat the odds and return Jynx to its Master before Team Rocket gets a hold of it?</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{cleanup|section}}\nThe episode opens on a snowy night with a castle on a cliff in the distance. It is [[Christmas]], and kids everywhere are waiting for their presents from [[Santa]], including the resident of the castle, [[Jessie]]. She pretends to be asleep, as the door to her room is slowly opened by Santa. He becomes trapped in a net, and unable to move. Jessie and {{MTR}} are enthusiastic about their capture, and cannot wait for the \'\'real\'\' Santa to come to be trapped, as this person had been [[James]] in a Santa suit.\n\nJessie recalls the night 10 years ago when she stopped believing in Santa. When waiting awake for him, a {{p|Jynx}} appears from the chimney and does nothing but take her doll, broken and thrown to the fireplace moments earlier by Jessie in her waiting enthusiasm. James and Meowth doubt Jessie\'s story, but Jessie is insistent that this occurred, and that Santa is a Jynx.\n\nMeanwhile, in the southern part of the [[Kanto]] region, {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} are scouting out a Jynx on a sunny beach, who is holding a single black boot. Ash attempts to [[Caught Pokémon|capture]] it, however, it does not work, and the Jynx\'s {{m|Lovely Kiss}} manages to defeat {{AP|Pikachu}}. {{an|Brock}} deduces that it must have a {{pkmn|Trainer}}. {{an|Misty}} is given the boot by the Jynx, and sees that it belongs to Santa, as an image is sewn to the inside. After Jynx telepathically tells its story to the group, they agree to help it get back to the [[North Pole]] to Santa. Jessie, on the other hand, sees Jynx as Santa attempting to con the twerps just as she had been 10 years ago, and plots to follow them to find Santa\'s lair and exact her revenge.\n\nAsh calls out his {{AP|Squirtle}}, and Misty calls out her {{TP|Misty|Goldeen}}, {{TP|Misty|Staryu}}, {{TP|Misty|Starmie}}, and {{TP|Misty|Psyduck}}. All of the {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} help pull their homemade raft toward the North Pole, except Psyduck, who cowers at the thought of having to swim (Misty instead lets Psyduck ride with them on the raft.) The Pokémon, however, quickly become tired, and so Ash volunteers to pull them the rest of the way. He, as well, becomes tired and hears a voice. Confused, he asks his friends if they said anything, but they haven\'t. The voice speaks again, and Ash is caught in a wave, while the others drift away on the raft. Ash is plunged underwater, and finally, the source of the voice reveals itself to him: a {{p|Lapras}}. The Lapras brings him above the water and reveals its telepathic powers, as well as the fact that it was sent by Santa to bring Jynx back to the North Pole. It offers to bring them the rest of the way there as thanks for aiding Jynx, and they accept. On their way to the North Pole, the group passes large icebergs, and huddle together in Jynx\'s hair for warmth. Soon, they arrive, but before they can enter Santa\'s workshop, {{TRT}} in their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|Gyarados submarine]], who has been secretly following the group, steal Jynx and trap the group under a net.\n\nTeam Rocket proceeds to bring the captured Jynx, tied in a rope, and enter Santa\'s workshop. Ash and friends confront them, but Team Rocket, holding Santa as a hostage, uses him as leverage. As Team Rocket is loading up all the presents, Santa and Ash and friends ask Jessie to stop. Angrily, Jessie exclaims that she never received any gifts as a child, and how she saw a Jynx stole her favorite doll 10 years ago. A Jynx, after retrieving Jessie\'s memory of the event telepathically, returns to the workshop and brings back Jessie\'s doll. Santa explains that Jynx brought the broken doll to him to fix it, but they were unable to give it back because Jessie had stopped believing in Santa. Despite this realization, Jessie still plans to steal all of the presents, and Team Rocket makes their getaway. Lapras freezes the submarine with its {{m|Ice Beam}}, but Ash, using {{AP|Charmander}}, accidentally unfreezes it by using {{m|Fire Spin}}. Team Rocket seems to have won, but Santa has all of his Jynx use {{m|Psywave}} to bring back the submarine, shake the presents out of it, blow up the submarine and send Team Rocket "blasting off again".\n\nThat evening, Santa begins his yearly journey around the world, using a {{p|Ponyta}} as his steed, and flies away. Ash regrets not having told Santa what he wanted, but Lapras assures him that Santa already knows. Santa\'s Jynx then present Ash, Misty, Brock, and Pikachu with gifts, as it begins to snow.\n\nTeam Rocket lie in a bed together, having been defeated once more, but Jessie has hung a stocking in the hopes that she might receive presents. The other two believe it to be futile, but just then, a Jynx appears in their window. They stare in shock at it, and it uses Lovely Kiss to put them all to sleep. Santa wishes a Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} attempts to {{pkmn2|caught|catch}} a {{p|Jynx}}, but fails since she belongs to another {{pkmn|Trainer}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* [[Santa Claus]]\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Jynx}}\n* {{p|Lapras}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n<!-- Details about characters of the day, and links to articles for major characters. -->\n[[File:Dare da Holiday Hi-Jynx.png|200px|thumb|right|{{tt|Dare da?|Who\'s That Pokémon?}}]]\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Santa Claus]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP Holiday Hi-Jynx.png|thumb|right|200px||Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Pidgeotto}} \'\'(US and international)\'\', {{p|Jynx}} \'\'(Japan)\'\'\n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Pidgeotto}} ({{OP|Ash|Pidgeotto}})\n* {{p|Bulbasaur}} ({{OP|Ash|Bulbasaur}})\n* {{p|Charmander}} ({{OP|Ash|Charmander}})\n* {{p|Squirtle}} ({{OP|Ash|Squirtle}})\n* {{p|Goldeen}} ({{OP|Misty|Goldeen}})\n* {{p|Staryu}} ({{OP|Misty|Staryu}})\n* {{p|Starmie}} ({{OP|Misty|Starmie}})\n* {{p|Psyduck}} ({{OP|Misty|Psyduck}})\n* {{p|Weezing}} ({{OP|James|Weezing}})\n* {{p|Lapras}} ([[Santa Claus|Santa]]\'s; debut)\n* {{p|Jynx}}  ([[Santa Claus|Santa]]\'s; multiple; debut)\n* {{p|Ponyta}} ([[Santa Claus|Santa]]\'s)\n\n==Scheduling conflict==\nAfter the hiatus caused by [[EP038]], the show moved from Tuesday to Thursday. The original schedule was as follows:\n{{Rescheduled episodes\u200e}}\n\nWhen episodes of the [[dub]] are aired in order, this episode and \'\'[[Snow Way Out!]]\'\' are placed between \'\'[[EP064|It\'s Mr. Mime Time]]\'\' and \'\'[[EP065|Showdown at the Po-ké Corral]]\'\', as this is the point at which the episodes aired in Japan. This confuses viewers due to Ash using Charmander instead of Charizard and Misty still having her Starmie and Horsea (and not having her Togepi). Chronologically, these episodes go either directly before or directly after \'\'[[EP039|Pikachu\'s Goodbye]]\'\'. Due to not airing when initially intended and being advertised as such by {{DL|Pokémon in the United States|Kids\' WB!}}, it is considered by Bulbapedia to be a [[List of anime specials|special episode]].\n\n==Removal from rotation==\nThis episode was pulled from rotation shortly after it was aired due to the fact {{p|Jynx}} was accused of being a {{wp|racial stereotype}} of African-Americans by {{wp|Carole Boston Weatherford}}. It can still be obtained on VHS and in the Indigo League Volume 3 DVD Pack Set and has been made available on {{DL|Pokémon in the United States|Cartoon Network Video}}. However, the episode has not re-aired in syndication, likely due to Jynx\'s appearance. Moreover, despite appearing on Cartoon Network Video, this episode was skipped on [[Pokémon.com]]\'s "[[Pokémon TV]]" video service, (and as of April 2013, removed from Pokémon.com entirely) nor has it been made available on Netflix. When the Indigo League Volume 3 DVD was reissued, the episode was removed. It is also not included in the Indigo League Complete Collection.\n\nThe English dub became available on Cartoon Network On Demand wherever available on cable providers in late March 2012, and has been added into the rotation on Boomerang as of 2011. No restrictions were placed on this episode in other countries airing the English dub or a dub based on the English dub, but the episode isn\'t mentioned on any local versions of Pokémon.com. However, this episode is banned in {{pmin|South Korea}}. The Japanese [[Netflix]] lists an English blurb for the episode despite it being banned, which says, "As children all over the world eagerly await Christmas, so does Team Rocket. It turns out they plan to catch Santa Claus and grab all of his presents!" Although this episode once aired on Hungama TV in {{pmin|South Asia|India}}, it never aired on Disney XD India and was replaced by \'\'[[EP103|Misty Meets Her Match]]\'\'.\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:Holiday Hi-JynxEdit.png|thumb|250px|A screenshot from the original episode]]\n* The end of the episode was followed by a music video of [[Together With the Wind]], the Japanese ending theme to \'\'[[M01|Mewtwo Strikes Back]]\'\', rather than a [[Professor Oak\'s Pokémon Lecture]] segment. This was likely due to the fact that the segment didn\'t exist when the episode was originally scheduled to be broadcast.\n* This is the only main series episode where the title card is read by [[Jessie]] in the dub. Jessie also reads the title card for \'\'[[HS12|Training Daze]]\'\', a side series episode. {{Ash}} reads this episode\'s title card in the Japanese version.\n* When an episode\'s preview is shown in the Japanese version, it usually ends with the words \'\'"Everybody, get Pokémon!"\'\' In this episode\'s preview, however, Ash said, \'\'"Everybody, get a present!"\'\' This is likely due to the Christmas theme of this episode.\n* Jessie\'s doll is called "Acha Ningyou" in the Japanese version and is a parody of the actor {{wp|Bruce Lee}}.\n\n===Errors===\n* Multiple times throughout the episode, the inside of {{p|Jynx}}\'s mouth was mistakenly colored white, instead of the usual red-pink.\n* During the group\'s battle with {{TRT}} later in the episode, [[Ash\'s hat]] continuously changes between forwards and backward.\n* In the remastered version that aired on Pokémon Smash!, Jynx\'s forearm appears white instead of red when it stands next to the tied up Ash, {{an|Misty}}, {{an|Brock}}, and [[Santa Claus]].\n* Due to being dubbed out of order, Ash\'s Pokédex is voiced by [[Eric Stuart]] in this episode, despite it taking place before \'\'[[EP050|Who Gets to Keep Togepi?]]\'\', where Ash\'s Pokédex is upgraded, meaning the Pokédex should still have the voice of [[Nicholas James Tate]] at this point.\n* When the closed captions mention Jessie in the episode, her name is misspelled as Jessy.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[Pikachu\'s Jukebox]]: [[Together Forever]]\n* In the Japanese version, Santa wrote his name in katakana on the inside of his boot. The English dub replaces this with a photo of Santa surrounded by a snowflake border.\n* Santa calls Jessie and Ash by name in the dub, but in the original, Santa refers to everyone as "children" instead.\n* Santa\'s reason for not giving Jessie her doll back is different in both versions: in the English version, Santa tells Jessie that he couldn\'t return the doll because she stopped believing in Santa, which made him powerless to visit her. In the Japanese version, Santa says that he tried to return it, but Jessie had already moved away.\n* In the dub, when the Jynx all use {{m|Psywave}}, they only chant their names over and over. In the original, they continuously say "\'\'Psycho\'\'" (the move\'s Japanese name is \'\'Psychowave\'\'). This may highlight how Jynx speaks a language similar to human speech.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=AAFFAA|bordercolor=FFAAAA\n|zh_cmn={{tt|迷唇姐的聖誕節|Jynx\'s Christmas}}\n|cs={{tt|Svátky s Jynx|Holidays with Jynx}}\n|nl={{tt|De Kerstman is een Jynx|The Santa Claus is a Jynx}}\n|fi={{tt|Joulun Jynx|The Jynx of Christmas}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Des joujoux par milliers|A thousand toys}}\n|de={{tt|Rossanas Oddyssee|Jynx\'s odd-yssey}}\n|he=חטיפה חגיגית {{tt|chatifa chagigit|Holiday kidnap}}\n|hu={{tt|Karácsonyi ajándékok|Christmas Presents}}\n|it={{tt|Incontro con Babbo Natale|Meeting Santa Claus}}\n|no={{tt|Snøblind Vei|Snowblind Way}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Feriado a Lá Jynx|Holiday by Jynx\'s Way}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Hi-Jynx Natalício|Christmas\'s Hi-Jynx}}\n|ru={{tt|Рождественская ловушка|Christmas trap}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Una Navidad con Jynx!|A Christmas with Jynx!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Navidades Jynx|Jynx Christmas}}\n|sv={{tt|Jynx räddar julen|Jynx saves Christmas}}\n|pl={{tt|Wesołych świąt, Jynx|Merry Christmas, Jynx}}\n|ro={{tt|Sărbătoarea cu Jynx|The Holiday with Jynx}}\n|hi=Santa और Jynx {{tt|\'\'Santa aur Jynx\'\'|Santa and Jynx}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n}}\n{{-}}\n\n{{PrevNext|\nprev=EP038 |\nnext=\'\'Snow Way Out!\'\' |\nnextlink=Snow Way Out! |\nseries=Original series |\nlist=original series episodes |\ncolorscheme=Kanto}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes]]\n[[Category:Banned episodes]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Hideki Sonoda]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded and directed by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Hiroshi Sakai]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Jessie]]\n[[Category:Christmas episodes]]\n\n[[de:Rossanas Odyssee]]\n[[es:EP065]]\n[[fr:Des joujoux par milliers]]\n[[it:Incontro con Babbo Natale]]\n[[ja:ルージュラのクリスマス]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第64集]]'}
