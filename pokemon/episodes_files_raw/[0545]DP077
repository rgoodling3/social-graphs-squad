It first aired in Japan on May 8, 2008 alongside [[DP078]] as part of a one-hour special, and in the United States on September 20, 2008.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/11_23-staging-a-heroes-welcome/-->\n<i>The day before the Wallace Cup, Zoey shows up at Lake Valor for the competition. She says hi to Dawn and meets May for the first time; while she\'s there, she also admits to Ash that Coordinators can still learn from regular Trainers, too. Not far away, Jessie is shocked to learn that she won the Solaceon Ribbon all by herself, without the use of any secret plans or cheats. Then it\'s on to the Wallace Cup and a dramatic entrance from Wallace himself—he\'ll even be one of the judges in the appeals performance round!\n\nMay and her Wartortle take the stage first and put on a great performance. In contrast, Jessie and Wobbuffet\'s appeals round performance doesn\'t actually seem to have much appeal for the judges. Then Zoey\'s new Finneon makes its dazzling Contest debut, which ratchets up the pressure on Dawn. It doesn\'t help Dawn\'s nerves when Ash and Buizel have a terrific performance, either; afraid of failing again, she\'s almost ready to quit before she starts.\n\nPiplup responds to Dawn\'s anxiety with a well-timed attack that snaps Dawn back into reality. She tries to relax as she heads onstage with Ambipom, and indeed, Ambipom puts on a performance that showcases its best qualities without relying on too much flash. With the first round over, it\'s up to the judges to decide which Coordinators are moving on the second round. Jessie is in for a disappointment, but Dawn is relieved to know she\'ll be battling in the second round along with Ash, Zoey, and May!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nThe day of the [[Wallace Cup]] has arrived and everyone is getting excited. {{an|Brock}} starts flirting with a girl when {{TP|Brock|Croagunk}} {{m|Poison Jab|jabs}} him. {{an|May}} noticing Brock being taken away by Croagunk, makes a note he\'s taken over [[Max]]\'s job. {{an|Dawn}} is really nervous now about the competition. The scene turns to Ash who confirms having signed up for the Wallace Cup when [[Zoey]] appears. Then the rest of {{ashfr|the gang}} show up and Dawn introduces May to Zoey. Meanwhile, [[Jessie]], dressed as Jessilina, is also entering, still thinking that [[James]] and {{MTR}} helped her win the [[Solaceon Town]] [[Pokémon Contest]]. James quickly denies having helped her with the Contest, leaving Jessie shocked she won the [[a:File:Solaceon Ribbon.png|Solaceon Ribbon]] all by herself.\n\nThe next day, [[Marian]] is announcing the big day has finally arrived. The Wallace Cup is about to start, while Dawn is messing up her hair again. May fixes it up, and Zoey says Dawn was like this during [[DP011|her debut]], meaning she is extra nervous. Back to the stage, Contest Master [[Wallace]] makes his appearance in an impressive way along with his {{p|Milotic}} and salutes the spectators. Marian informs the audience he will be a special judge and then proceeds to present the other [[Contest Judge|judges]]: [[Raoul Contesta]] from the [[Pokémon Activities Committee]], [[Mr. Sukizo]] from the [[Pokémon Fan Club]], and [[Nurse Joy]] from the [[Lake Valor]] [[Pokémon Center]]. Then she explains that the winning {{pkmn|Coordinator}} will receive the {{DL|Ribbon|Aqua Ribbon}}, a special [[Ribbon]] that is valid to use in any region.\n\nThe [[Appeal|Performance Stage]] begins and May is the first participant to be called on stage. She sends out her {{TP|May|Wartortle}} during , showing that her Squirtle has evolved. The scene briefly changes to [[Max]], [[Norman]], and [[Caroline]] watching May on [[television]] back in [[Petalburg City]] and to [[Drew]], [[Solidad]], and [[Harley]] also following May on TV from [[Ecruteak City]]. The scene reverts to May who orders Wartortle to use {{m|Rapid Spin}} on the water field and to finish up with {{m|Aqua Tail}}. The Contest continues with performances from other Coordinators and with Jessilina\'s turn. She uses {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}}, failing to impress the judges. Zoey\'s turn comes up revealing she obtained a {{p|Finneon}} who does a fantastic performance making Dawn even more nervous.\n\nAsh\'s act with {{AP|Buizel}} is amazing and is praised by the judges, however [[Paul]] catches the appeal on TV and is unimpressed to see Ash has entered a Pokémon Contest. By now, Dawn is extremely nervous that she is not going to make it, but Piplup snaps her out of it and she heads for the stage. She may have didn\'t send out {{TP|Dawn|Ambipom}} on her first try, but the act was stunning, soaking James and Meowth in the progress and she is congratulated by the judges.\n\nNext, she returns to her friends and the results are announced, which make Dawn relieved now because everyone except Jessilina made it to the [[Contest Battle|Battle Stage]]. And now, this is where the real action begins!\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}}, {{an|Dawn}}, {{an|May}}, [[Jessie|Jessilina]], and [[Zoey]] enter the [[Wallace Cup]].\n* May and Zoey meet for the first time.\n* May\'s {{p|Squirtle}} is revealed to have [[Evolution|evolved]] into a {{TP|May|Wartortle}} during her travels in [[Johto]] and learned {{m|Aqua Tail}}.\n* Zoey is revealed to have obtained a {{p|Finneon}}.\n* Ash, Dawn, May, and Zoey make it to the [[Contest Battle]]s while Jessilina loses in the [[Appeal|Performance Stage]].\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* {{si|Kyle}}\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* [[May\'s Wartortle]]\n\n=====TV episode debuts=====\n* {{p|Finneon}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* [[Drew]]\n* [[Harley]]\n* [[Solidad]]\n* [[Paul]]\n* [[Zoey]]\n* {{si|Kenny}}\n* [[Wallace]]\n* [[Norman]]\n* [[Caroline]]\n* [[Johanna]]\n* [[Marian]]\n* [[Raoul Contesta]]\n* [[Mr. Sukizo]]\n* \'\'[[Sinnoh Now]]\'\' staff\n** {{si|Rhonda}}\n* {{si|Kyle}}\n* [[Pokémon Coordinator]]s\n* Wallace\'s fans\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Piplup}} ({{OP|Dawn|Piplup}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Mime Jr.}} ({{OP|James|Mime Jr.}})\n* {{p|Buizel}} ({{OP|Ash|Buizel}})\n* {{p|Munchlax}} ({{OP|May|Munchlax}})\n* {{p|Squirtle}} ({{OP|May|Wartortle}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Wartortle}} ({{OP|May|Wartortle}})\n* {{p|Ambipom}} ({{OP|Dawn|Ambipom}})\n* {{p|Croagunk}} ({{OP|Brock|Croagunk}})\n* {{p|Finneon}} ([[Zoey]]\'s)\n* {{p|Milotic}} ([[Wallace]]\'s)\n* {{p|Cloyster}} ({{si|Kyle}}\'s)\n* {{p|Glameow}} ({{OP|Johanna|Glameow}})\n* {{p|Chatot}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Vulpix}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Venomoth}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Sharpedo}} (Coordinator\'s)\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:Sakura and Tomoyo DP077.png|thumb|220px|Sakura and Tomoyo lookalikes]]\n* [[I Won\'t Lose! ~Haruka\'s Theme~]], {{so|Battle Frontier}}, and [[By Your Side ~Hikari\'s Theme~]] are used as insert songs during the [[Appeal|performances]] of {{an|May}}, {{Ash}}, and {{an|Dawn}}, respectively.\n* Both May and Dawn had most of their [[rival]]s appear in this episode, either in cameos or throughout the course of the episode: Drew, Harley, and Solidad for May; and Zoey and Kenny for Dawn. It should be noted that Ash\'s rival [[Paul]] also had a brief appearance. [[Nando]] was the only one of Dawn\'s or Ash\'s main rivals not to appear.\n* This is the only episode of the [[Wallace Cup]] arc in which [[James\'s Mime Jr.]] appears.\n* Two girls near the beginning of the episode resemble {{wp|Sakura Kinomoto}} and {{wp|Tomoyo Daidōji}} from \'\'{{wp|Cardcaptor Sakura}}\'\'. This is most likely a joke on how their hats resemble the one Wallace wears.\n* The two children running and wearing {{p|Lucario}} and {{p|Weavile}} masks may be a reference to \'\'[[M08|Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]\'\'.\n* Instead of [[Professor Oak\'s Big Pokémon Encyclopedia]], the end of the episode featured a memorial to \'\'[[M03|Spell of the Unown: Entei]]\'\', called [[Pikachu the Movie Memorial]]. This is part of a countdown to \'\'[[M11|Giratina and the Sky Warrior]]\'\'.\n* This is the second [[Pokémon Contest]] [[DP061|in a row]] that {{TP|Dawn|Ambipom}}\'s {{i|Poké Ball}} almost slips out of Dawn\'s hand due to her nervousness.\n* This episode marks one of the extremely rare occasions that [[Jessie]] actually sends out {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}}, as opposed to him popping out of his Poké Ball on his own accord.\n* Some of the participating {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s bear [[Anime character recycling|striking resemblances]] to previous [[Character of the day|characters of the day]]:\n** One resembles [[Cherry]], who appeared in \'\'[[EP156|The Psychic Sidekicks!]]\'\'.\n** Another resembles [[Temacu]], who appeared in \'\'[[EP198|The Heartbreak of Brock]]\'\'.\n** Two resemble [[Oscar and Andi]], who appeared in \'\'[[AG072|The Bicker the Better]]\'\'.\n* In \'\'[[DP114|Another One Gabites the Dust!]]\'\', 37 episodes later, it is revealed that [[Ursula]] had lost in the Performance Stage of the Wallace Cup.\n* {{TRT}} does not blast off or recite their {{motto}} in this episode, though Jessie is briefly launched into the sky as part of her act.\n* This episode marks Ash\'s second and final participation in an official Pokémon Contest.\n** This is also the debut of Ash\'s Contest Costume.\n\n===Errors===\n* When {{TP|Brock|Croagunk}} drags {{an|Brock}} away from the woman selling crepes, May\'s gloves disappear.\n* When {{MTR}} and [[James]] show their displeasure at Jessie\'s performance, there is a sound indicating a Pokémon coming out of its Poké Ball, despite {{TP|James|Mime Jr.}} already being outside its Ball.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* When Jessie claims that James and Meowth helped her during the [[Solaceon Town]] Contest in the English dub, James says, "We didn\'t do a bloody thing!". On some prints, the line is dubbed to "We didn\'t do a single thing!" since "bloody" is classified as a vulgar word in some English-speaking countries.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FCC|bordercolor=99F\n|zh_cmn={{tt|大家都是勁敵！米可利杯！|Everyone\'s a Rival!
