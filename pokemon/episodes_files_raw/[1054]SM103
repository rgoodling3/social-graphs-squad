It first aired in Japan on January 6, 2019 and in the United States on April 27, 2019.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/22_11-heart-of-fire-heart-of-stone/-->\n<i>Brock and Misty are having quite a busy vacation in Alola! Ash and the Pokémon School gang admire Brock’s culinary skills, boosted by delicious ingredients from Kiawe’s family farm. They decide to visit the farm on Akala Island—mostly because Brock has been determined to meet the beautiful Kahuna Olivia!\n\nLike many of Brock’s crushes, Olivia is taken aback…but the two are soon bonding over their shared love of Rock types, and when Team Rocket attacks, they respond with a paired-up Z-Move! Brock and Misty’s visit ends with a beautiful fireworks display and promises to return to Alola for more vacation fun!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}}, {{ashcl}}, and his old friends {{an|Misty}} and {{an|Brock}} have a picnic lunch, prepared by Brock, by the sea. Brock admits that {{an|Kiawe}}\'s family\'s cheese was the special ingredient, and Kiawe explains that his family\'s cheese is the best on [[Akala Island]]. With the mention of Akala, Brock takes out his blue book and flips to his pages on [[Olivia]], much to the disapproval of Misty and {{an|Lana}}. Brock then declares that they will visit Kiawe\'s farm, secretly hoping to catch Olivia during the visit. Kiawe explains that Olivia travels a lot and may not be there, but Brock suggests it will then be a fateful encounter. The group then sets off for Akala Island aboard their [[Ultra Guardians|Ultra Guardian]] [[Poké Ride|Ride Pokémon]].\n\nDuring the voyage, Lana decides to call out [[Sandy]] and {{TP|Lana|Popplio}} to enjoy a swim. As the two Pokémon play in the water, {{TP|Misty|Psyduck}} comes out unprompted, but Misty quickly [[recall]]s it to its {{i|Poké Ball}}, as it can\'t swim. On a nearby island, {{MTR}} spots the group traveling to Akala Island through his binoculars and alerts [[Jessie]]. She declares that they must catch {{AP|Pikachu}} for {{an|Giovanni}}, but Meowth explains that they still need to fix their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|mecha]]. Jessie shouts at [[James]] and {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} to get the machine working faster.\n\nAsh and his friends arrive at [[Paniola Ranch|Kiawe\'s family farm]], and Misty and Brock explore the area. After they get into some misadventures, the Miltank and Mudbray\'s [[cry|cries]] alert Kiawe and the others to an intruder, a {{pkmn2|wild}} {{p|Kangaskhan}}. As Kiawe is about to send out one of his Pokémon to fend off Kangaskhan, Brock alerts everyone to Kangaskhan\'s empty pouch. {{an|Sophocles}} spots the baby Kangaskhan hiding behind its mother\'s leg, and Brock notices it has a swollen leg. Brock approaches the Kangaskhan duo, pulls out a Poké Ball, and calls out his {{TP|Brock|Comfey}}. Ash is surprised to see that Brock now has a Comfey, and Brock explains that [[Nurse Joy]] gave it to him as thanks for [[SM102|his earlier assistance]]. Brock continues to approach, and his calm tone and Comfey\'s [[move]]s help calm the aggressive mother. Brock eventually reaches the injured infant and goes on to treat her injured leg. With her leg now bandaged, the baby Kangaskhan climbs back into her mother\'s pouch, and the duo then returns to the wild. Just as everyone is admiring Brock\'s professionalism and skills as a {{tc|Doctor}}, Brock\'s attention returns to meeting Olivia.\n\nThe group decide to ascend [[Wela Volcano Park|Wela Volcano]] in the hopes of meeting Olivia, but Brock is increasingly becoming frantic and emotional as the search goes on. Olivia soon spots the group and rushes towards them, tripping on a stone in the process. Brock reaches out for Olivia\'s hand and formally introduces himself to her and then proposes that they get married. As Brock explains that they\'re meeting was fate, Misty pulls him away by the ear and explains that Brock had actively searched for Olivia. Everyone continues to trek up the volcano, and Olivia explains that she has more important [[Island Kahuna]] duties to attend. Mallow requests a [[photography|photo]] with the Island Kahuna and Olivia agrees. Everyone poses and Rotom takes the snapshot, but when Rotom reveals the photo, it also includes a familiar trio of {{tc|Hiker}}s. Olivia explains that the Hikers now patrol Wela Volcano Park, though have a bad habit of {{wp|photobombing}} sightseers\' holiday snaps. Brock looks over the photo and is irritated to notice that one of the Hikers\' heads is covering up his face. The trio of Hikers soon leave the scene just as quickly as they arrived. As Brock enters an angry tirade, Kiawe tells Olivia that Brock is a {{pkmn|battle}}r and is the former [[Pewter City]] [[Gym Leader]]. Brock, with a glint in his eye, adds that he was a {{type|Rock}} [[Type expert|specialist]]. Olivia is instantly interested and offers Brock a match, which he gladly accepts.\n\nBrock sends out his faithful {{TP|Brock|Sudowoodo}} to battle against Olivia\'s {{p|Lycanroc}}. Olivia makes the first move and has Lycanroc fire a {{m|Rock Slide}}. Sudowoodo swats the projectiles away with a {{m|Hammer Arm}}. Olivia is impressed by Brock\'s performance and has Lycanroc use {{m|Double Team}} followed by {{m|Accelerock}}. Sudowoodo uses {{m|Feint Attack}} to quickly locate the real Lycanroc amongst its duplicates and manages to land a blow. Lycanroc retaliates with {{m|Drill Run}}, but Sudowoodo is still standing. Olivia is astounded by Sudowoodo\'s resilience and asks Brock to show her more of his techniques.\n \nMeanwhile, Team Rocket uses the opportunity to grab some of the group\'s Pokémon and everybody on the scene with their Giga Meowthbot 4. {{TRT}} launch into their {{motto}} and soon try to leave the area. However, Olivia\'s Lycarnoc hits the mecha with a Rock Slide from behind. Brock has Sudowoodo strike the robot with a {{m|Low Kick}}, immediately infuriating the Rocket trio. As Meowth attempts to fire a powerful beam from the mecha\'s head, Olivia prepares to use a [[Z-Move]] to deal with the troublemakers. Brock grabs a hold of Olivia’s hand, and together the pair pass on the Z-Power to Lycanroc to perform {{m|Continental Crush}}. The attack is unusually love heart-shaped, but Meowth manages to hold off the attack. Suddenly {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Stufful}} and its mother {{an|Bewear}} arrive on the scene. The distraction causes Meowth to lose focus and the mecha is slowly crushed by Continental Crush. The Pokémon are immediately freed, and Pikachu uses {{m|Iron Tail}} to free Ash and his friends. Eventually, the mecha explodes, but Bewear manages to rescue Team Rocket from another blast off and flees Wela Volcano.\n\nBack on [[Melemele Island]], Ash, his friends and Olivia join {{an|Professor Kukui}} and [[Professor Burnet]] to watch some fireworks. Misty and Brock thank Ash and declare their [[Alola]] vacation an unforgettable time. Ash declares that he will continue to study Pokémon in the hopes of achieving his dreams of becoming a [[Pokémon Master]]. Misty and Brock are not surprised by Ash\'s ambition, declaring they know each other too well after such a long time. Misty then declares her dream is to continue training {{t|Water}} Pokémon and to make [[Cerulean Gym]] the world\'s best [[Gym]]. Misty and Ash then agree to a Gym challenge the next time they meet. Brock, Misty, and Ash put their hands in a circle and lift them out in celebration.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
