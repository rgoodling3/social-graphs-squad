Iris VS {{tt|Hikari|Dawn}}!!\'\') is the 91st episode of the {{series|Best Wishes}}, and the 748th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on August 23, 2012 and in the United States on December 8, 2012.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/15_43-battling-authority-once-again/-->\n<i>It’s time for the second round of the Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup, and Ash, Cilan, Iris, Dawn, and Trip are all in the hunt! A very confident Trip is up first, again winning his bout quickly despite a type disadvantage and moving on to the semi-finals.\n\nMeanwhile, Iris steps outside to try to convince Dragonite to listen to her commands when they battle, instead of doing whatever it wants. But it appears to be a tough sell for the headstrong Pokémon—although a few wise words from Cynthia seem to be getting through. While she’s gone, Cilan defeats his opponent thanks to some remarkable teamwork with his Stunfisk. Then, with help from Boldore, Ash moves into the semi-finals as well!\n\nThe last battle of the round is Iris versus Dawn! It’s a clash of giants indeed, as the towering Dragonite faces off against the gargantuan Mamoswine—and at first it seems Dragonite is actually paying attention to Iris, as it obeys her first command to dodge! But it quickly reverts to its usual tactic of taking every attack head-on, and Iris gets more and more frustrated as Dawn and Mamoswine display excellent coordination. Once again, Dragonite manages to win the match on its own, and after a friendly pep talk from Dawn, Iris is even more determined to connect with her stubborn Pokémon.\n\nThe semi-finals get under way, and the first match is Trip versus Cilan! Trip has his eyes on the ultimate prize—a battle against Unova Champion Alder—and he’s secretly planning to challenge Sinnoh Champion Cynthia as well. Cilan is hoping Trip’s arrogance will make him careless—but no such luck, as Serperior manages to get through Crustle’s impressive defenses and knock Cilan out of the tournament.\n\nNext up, it’s Ash and his Krokorok versus Iris and her Dragonite! Which of our heroes will be moving on to face Trip in the finals?</i>\n\n==Plot==\nThe match-ups for the next round of the [[Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup]] are announced to be [[Manning]] and [[Trip]], [[Horatio]] and {{an|Cilan}}, [[Geraldo]] and {{Ash}}, and {{an|Dawn}} and {{an|Iris}}. [[Georgia]] and [[Burgundy]] talk to each other, with Georgia hoping that Iris doesn\'t lose to anybody but her. Freddy and [[Alder]] once again remind the participants that the winner of the tournament will get to battle Alder, and the matches begin. \n\n[[Trip\'s Serperior]] faces off against Manning\'s {{p|Heatmor}} and wins despite the type advantage with another {{m|Solar Beam}} like in the first round. Cilan and Horatio then face off, sending out their respective {{TP|Cilan|Stunfisk}} and {{p|Cinccino}}. Stunfisk wins with a {{m|Sludge Bomb}} and Cilan defeats Horatio. During the matches, Iris leaves to go talk to her Dragonite, who completely refuses to listen to her. [[Cynthia]] appears, noting that Iris seems to be having trouble. Cynthia approaches Dragonite, but he snarls at her and Cynthia realizes that the Pokémon doesn\'t trust human yet. She tells him that it doesn\'t need to keep it\'s guard up, and that humans and Pokémon need to work together. She finally manages to pet him, saying that if it relaxed things would be much better.\n\nIris returns right before Ash\'s match, along with {{an|Meloetta}} to cheer them on. While Ash\'s {{AP|Boldore}} faces Horatio\'s {{p|Reuniclus}}, Trip is seen walking through the halls, catching Cynthia\'s attention. When Cynthia asks him why he isn\'t watching the matches, Trip says he\'s got a winning strategy and that watching the battles wouldn\'t matter. Cynthia replies that she\'s impressed and wishes him luck. Ash\'s Boldore uses {{m|Rock Blast}} to defeat Runiclus, and Ash wins his second round match. \n\nFor the last second round battle, Iris\'s Dragonite battles [[Dawn\'s Mamoswine]]. Dawn starts off with having Mamoswine use {{m|Hidden Power}}, and Iris orders Dragonite to dodge the attack. Dragonite finally listens to Iris and moves out of the way, but when Mamoswine uses {{m|Ice Shard}}, Dragonite takes the super effective attack head on despite Iris\'s orders. Dawn has Mamoswine use {{m|Take Down}} and Dragonite stops the attack on his own accord, along with a close-range Ice Shard, before flipping Mamoswine over. Mamoswine gets back up and attacks with another Take Down, but despite Iris\'s pleading and commands to use {{m|Flamethrower}} to counter, Dragonite refuses to dodge, taking it and another Ice Shard head on. Dawn tries to finish the battle with {{m|Ice Fang}}, but Dragonite braces itself and stops the attack. When his arms start to freeze from the move, Dragonite breaks free and flies up, attacking Dawn\'s Mamoswine with {{m|Dragon Rush}} and winning the battle. Dawn congratulates Iris, and Cynthia watches, thinking that when the two manage to connect they will become a powerful team.\n\nThe semifinal match ups are announced. Trip and Cilan are battling each other, and so are Iris and Ash. Trip and Cilan face off first, using their respective Serperior and {{TP|Cilan|Crustle}}. Serperior uses {{m|Leer}} and {{m|Solar Beam}}, and despite sustaining damage, Crustle endures the attack. Cilan has Crustle use {{m|X-Scissor}} and {{m|Rock Slide}}, but Serperior dodges both attacks and it and Trip win the battle with a {{m|Frenzy Plant}}. Alder comments that Trip battled well, but power isn\'t everything. Trip glares back at the {{pkmn|Champion}}, thinking to prove him wrong. Dawn approaches Iris before her battle with Ash as she is talking to her Dragonite and comments that she\'d had trouble with Mamoswine before they had become friends, encouraging her to keep trying.\n\nIris then sends out Dragonite, and Ash his {{AP|Krokorok}}.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
