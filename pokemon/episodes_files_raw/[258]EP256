Battle in the Water!\'\') is the 256th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on July 11, 2002 and in the United States on July 12, 2003. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/05_46-just-add-water/-->\n<i>On the road back to New Bark Town, Ash and friends stop for a rest near the ocean. There they spot a sign advertising a synchronized Pokémon swimming event. They run toward the area where the event is being held, arriving just as it begins. Close behind is Team Rocket, who quickly hatch a plan to steal all of the Pokémon from the swimming show. After the first show, Misty, Ash, and Brock chance to meet the trainer in charge of this event. A rivalry quickly develops between Misty and this Water Pokémon trainer. Before these two trainers have a chance to battle however, Ash steps in and challenges her to a battle in one of her underwater arenas. Due in part perhaps to this trainer\'s home-court advantage Ash quickly loses. Misty then steps in and challenges the trainer to a three on three Pokémon battle. Misty is hard-pressed to defeat such an experienced trainer on her own field, but will her intimate knowledge of water Pokémon guide her to victory?</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} are on their way back to [[New Bark Town]] via a rocky road. The group comes across a tunnel, which {{an|Brock}} suggests that it may lead to the ocean. {{an|Misty}} perks up and promptly runs through, and as predicted the group finds themselves staring at the sea. Misty takes a deep breath of the salty air before calling out her {{t|Water}} Pokémon. {{TP|Misty|Staryu}}, {{TP|Misty|Corsola}}, {{TP|Misty|Goldeen}} and {{TP|Misty|Politoed}} enjoy a break in the ocean water. {{TP|Misty|Psyduck}} wanders towards the water, but a slight splash is enough to terrify it to the verge of tears, and Misty gently reminds it that it can\'t swim.\n\nThey continue along the beach, and they see a sign for a synchronized swimming event. Brock becomes very excited, imagining pretty girls in bathing suits performing alongside Pokémon. He promptly takes off, forcing Ash and Misty to run after him. He runs up to a boy on the beach and asks about the event, and the boy informs him that it\'s just about to start. Ash and his friends head into a huge stadium and sit down in the stands, and Brock becomes even more excited when Ash comments on whether it will be like the [[Cerulean Gym]], and lavishes praise on {{an|Daisy}}, {{ka|Lily}}, and [[Violet]]. Misty is none too pleased and urges Brock to settle down. As the show starts, a {{p|Mantine}}, {{p|Qwilfish}} and {{p|Lanturn}} leap from under water, followed by a young man, much to Brock\'s dismay. Ash and Misty watch the show while Brock sobs into his arm, the former two complimenting the performer’s talents with his Pokémon. Meanwhile {{TRT}} is standing up above the stadium watching, also impressed by the skill of the Pokémon. {{MTR}} then [[Boss fantasy|spins a tale]] about how impressed {{an|Giovanni}} would be with the Water types to cheer him on in his morning swim. [[Jessie]] and [[James]] are instantly taken with the Meowth’s vision and set their sights on capturing the Water Pokémon.\n\nAsh and Misty heap praise on the boy after the show, with Misty talking over Brock\'s requests for pretty girls. The performer introduces himself as [[Dorian]], the Leader of the Coastline Gym. He gives the group a tour, and the trio see photos of Dorian with [[The Sensational Sisters|Misty\'s sisters]]. Dorian explains that he has been to the [[Cerulean Gym]] many times and dreams of having a Gym just like it, as a lover of Water Pokémon. Dorian explains that for the time being, Coastline is just a private Gym, which explains to Brock and Ash why they\'d not heard of it before. Misty, however, is more eager as to whether her sisters mentioned anything about her to Dorian. Much to Misty\'s horror, all Dorian had heard was that the girls were sad that the baby of the family was such a loser. Misty bites everyone\'s heads off and the argument turns to who loves Water Pokémon the most. Dorian disputes Misty\'s claim, and she challenges him to a {{pkmn|battle}}, seeking to prove herself as the best {{pkmn|Trainer}} from {{ci|Cerulean}}.\n\nLater, Team Rocket is in their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|Magikarp submarine]], when they come under attack from Dorian\'s Pokémon. The submarine springs a leak and begins to sink. Meanwhile, Dorian shows the friends his underwater stadium designed to give Water Pokémon the chance to reach their full potential, which Misty praises, commenting that she\'s always dreamed of having a real underwater battle. Ash notices an odd looking Magikarp float past, chased by Dorian\'s Pokémon, but Misty immediately recognizes it as Team Rocket\'s submarine. The submarine reaches the surface, and the trio leap out for air. They find themselves confronted by Ash, who sends {{AP|Totodile}} out to blast the sub with {{m|Water Gun}}. Mantine and Lanturn join in with {{m|Bubble Beam}} and Water Gun, respectively, sending Team Rocket blasting off.\n\nDorian asks Misty if she\'s ready for the battle, but Ash pleads to be allowed to give Totodile a run before Misty battles. Misty reluctantly agrees, and so Ash and Dorian descend into the underwater stadium, where Brock acts as a referee. Totodile goes up against Lanturn, both managing to dodge each other\'s Water Gun, leading Misty to note how quickly Totodile moves underwater. Totodile is ordered to use {{m|Scratch}}, but Lanturn uses {{m|Supersonic}} and confuses it, causing it to flip upside down. Lanturn then hits Totodile with {{m|Take Down}}, before knocking it out of the water with a follow up move. Both airborne, Lanturn flips around in mid-air and uses Take Down again, knocking Totodile back into the water and slamming it against the ocean floor. Misty points out that Ash\'s comfortable style of battling won\'t apply to a place where Lanturn can swim above and below his Pokémon. Totodile gets up and uses {{m|Slash}} on Lanturn, striking it hard. However, Lanturn counters with {{m|Spark}}, hitting Totodile and shocking it, before ramming it with Take Down which knocks it out, giving Dorian the match. Brock tells Ash that Dorian was just much more experienced in the Gym’s aquatic setting.\n\nMisty then challenges Dorian to a three-on-three battle. Misty calls on her Goldeen, but Psyduck pops out first. However, upon realizing it is underwater, it frantically scrambles for the surface and reaches the edge of the pool. Misty sympathizes with Psyduck and they get a flotation ring out so it can still enjoy the water. Back underwater, Misty\'s Goldeen goes up against Qwilfish. Goldeen\'s {{m|Horn Attack}} is dodged by Qwilfish, who in turn strikes with {{m|Tackle}}. Goldeen uses {{m|Agility}} to dodge Qwilfish\'s other Tackles, and then lands a Horn Attack on it. Goldeen then uses Supersonic, but Qwilfish shrugs off its effects and fires {{m|Pin Missile}}. Goldeen manages to reflect those coming its way by spinning its tail. Goldeen aims a {{m|Horn Drill}}, which Qwilfish dodges. Qwilfish follows up with a Pin Missile, hammering Goldeen from behind. A final Take Down is enough to knock Goldeen out and win the round for Qwilfish.\n\nPromising something completely different, Misty sends Corsola out to battle Mantine. Misty mutters to herself that she cannot afford to lose. Outside, Team Rocket is clad in scuba gear, preparing to make another attempt. Mantine uses Supersonic on Corsola, but Corsola shrugs it off and rams Mantine with Tackle. Mantine recovers with two {{m|Wing Attack}}s, each striking Corsola hard. Mantine performs Agility before moving in for a Tackle attack, dodging Corsola\'s {{m|Spike Cannon}} and then ramming it into the rocks. Much to Dorian\'s surprise, Misty orders {{m|Recover}}, then full strength Corsola uses Spike Cannon again. This strikes Mantine, and a follow-up Tackle is enough to win the round for Corsola and Misty, evening the score. Dorian recalls Mantine and comments that Misty is pretty powerful after all.\n\nIn the third round, Dorian\'s Lanturn steps up, but before Misty can send either Staryu or Politoed, a torrent of water interrupts the battle, knocking everyone over. Team Rocket arrive in a giant crab robot and recites their {{motto}}. One of the claws opens and begins to draw water in, sucking the Trainers forward. Totodile and Qwilfish attempt to stop the robot, but Team Rocket amp up the suction power and both Pokémon are captured. Mantine and Lanturn are also helpless to resist. Misty sends out Corsola, outside of the suction, and it Tackles the arm, pointing it skyward. Psyduck and its flotation ring are then sucked underwater. Misty desperately leaps forward and pushes Psyduck aside, but is sucked into the machine herself. Dorian and Corsola rush to her aid, but they are also sucked in. Team Rocket then reverse the claws, and the left claw ejects water, blowing Brock, Ash and Pikachu away. When the dust clears, the giant robot has vanished, and Ash vows to come and rescue them.\n\nAbove onshore, Ash sends {{AP|Noctowl}} for an aerial search. It soon spots something, so Ash and Brock run after it. Psyduck, not wanting to be alone, toddles after them. On the surface, Jessie and James gloat over their prize, while Misty and Dorian struggle to free themselves from their bonds. Ash and Brock quickly arrive, led by Noctowl. Team Rocket send out {{TP|James|Victreebel}} and {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}}. Ash is about counter with {{AP|Phanpy}}, but Psyduck leaps into the fray first, angry and determined, unlike the usual attitude it displays. As Brock unties Misty and Dorian, Ash wonders if Psyduck wants to battle. After a pause, Psyduck turns back around and looks confused. Furious, Jessie orders Arbok to {{m|Bite}} Psyduck, and it clamps onto its head. Victreebel fires a {{m|Razor Leaf}}, which causes Psyduck to flail around in pain. Misty jumps up and tells Arbok that it\'s not biting hard enough. With a huge headache, Psyduck uses {{m|Confusion}}, sending Victreebel and Arbok flying back at their Trainers. Psyduck then uses {{m|Psychic}} to send a powerful force of energy at Team Rocket, destroying their robot and sending them blasting off. Dorian is left in awe of Psyduck\'s surprising strength.\n\nAsh, Misty and Dorian reunite with their Pokémon, and Dorian comments again on Psyduck, who merely looks confused at the compliment. Misty says that it\'s a shame that they couldn\'t finish their battle, but Dorian says that had she used Psyduck, she would have easily won. With the score at 1-1, the two decide to call it a draw. Dorian tells Misty that he thinks she\'s every bit as good as her sisters, and Ash and Misty admit they\'ve learned a lot from being there. Ash promises to tell everyone about the Coastline Gym when they reach the [[Silver Conference]]. Dorian thanks them sincerely, and promises to inform Misty\'s sisters on how well Misty is doing when he next visits Cerulean City. In a show off of Dorian\'s admiration for Misty\'s strength, a photograph of himself and Misty posing with Corsola and Psyduck is now pinned alongside his pictures of the Sensational Sisters. The group bids farewell to Dorian and continues on their way towards their next adventure.\n\n==Major events==\n* [[Ash\'s Totodile]] is revealed to know {{m|Slash}}.\n* [[Misty\'s Goldeen]] is revealed to know {{m|Supersonic}} and {{m|Horn Drill}}.\n* [[Misty\'s Psyduck]] is revealed to know {{m|Psychic}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n[[File:PMTV EP256.png|thumb|200px|{{tt|Pocket Monster TV|Who\'s That Pokémon}}]]\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{an|Giovanni}} ([[Boss fantasy|fantasy]])\n* [[The Sensational Sisters]] (picture)\n** {{an|Daisy}}\n** [[Violet]]\n** {{ka|Lily}}\n* [[Dorian]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP EP256.png|thumb|200px|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Rhydon}} \'\'(US and international)\'\', {{p|Goldeen}} \'\'(Japan)\'\'\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Togepi}} ({{OP|Misty|Togepi}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Totodile}} ({{OP|Ash|Totodile}})\n* {{p|Noctowl}} ({{OP|Ash|Noctowl}}; {{Shiny}})\n* {{p|Goldeen}} ({{OP|Misty|Goldeen}})\n* {{p|Staryu}} ({{OP|Misty|Staryu}})\n* {{p|Psyduck}} ({{OP|Misty|Psyduck}})\n* {{p|Politoed}} ({{OP|Misty|Politoed}})\n* {{p|Corsola}} ({{OP|Misty|Corsola}})\n* {{p|Arbok}} ({{OP|Jessie|Arbok}})\n* {{p|Victreebel}} ({{OP|James|Victreebel}})\n* {{p|Qwilfish}} ([[Dorian]]\'s)\n* {{p|Lanturn}} ([[Dorian]]\'s)\n* {{p|Mantine}} ([[Dorian]]\'s)\n\n==Trivia==\n* This was the last episode to air before \'\'[[M05|Pokémon Heroes: Latios & Latias]]\'\' debuted in Japanese theaters.\n* This episode marks the first time a main character other than {{Ash}} challenges a [[Gym Leader]] of any sort, as {{an|Misty}} challenges [[Dorian]] in this episode. The second main character to do this is {{an|Dawn}}, but unlike Misty, Dawn challenges an official Gym Leader.\n** It also marks the first and so far only time a main character other than Ash does not lose against a Gym Leader in {{pkmn|battle}}. Dawn lost her battle against [[Maylene]], and {{an|Cilan}} lost his battle against [[Skyla]]. \n[[File:EP256 error.png|thumb|200px|Goldeen\'s "Lure Ball"]]\n* In this episode, {{TRT}} uses a {{DL|Team Rocket mottos|Just Add Water motto|variation}} of their motto.\n* This is one of the few times that Misty and {{TP|Misty|Psyduck}} show affection for one another – Misty saves Psyduck from Team Rocket\'s mecha, and Psyduck willingly challenges Team Rocket after they kidnap Misty.\n* This episode first aired in the United States exactly one year and one day after its Japanese airing.\n* When {{p|Lanturn}} uses {{m|Spark}}, {{Ash}}, {{an|Misty}}, and [[Dorian]] are unaffected, even though water conducts electricity. This is an example of [[anime physics]].\n\n===Errors===\n* When Misty throws her [[Poké Ball]]s to let out her Pokémon, only three Balls are seen and five Pokémon come out.\n* After Misty says "That was great, Goldeen, take a long rest", {{TP|Misty|Goldeen}}\'s Poké Ball turns into a [[Lure Ball]] for a split-second. The next Pokémon she uses is {{TP|Misty|Corsola}}, who is kept in a Lure Ball.\n* At the end of the episode, when Misty and Dorian are speculating about what would have happened if Team Rocket hadn\'t interrupted their battle, Dorian mentions the possibility that Misty could have called out Psyduck. Psyduck was already out, floating in an inner tube on the surface, and its panic after popping out underwater made it very unlikely it would be able to battle anyway.\n* If Psyduck is unable to swim, it shouldn\'t have been able to get to the edge of the pool like it did.\n* Misty says "Ash" despite her mouth being taped at that moment.\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|bg={{tt|Още малко вода|A little more water}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|龍宮道館，在水中戰鬥！|Lónggōng (Coastline) Gym, Underwater Battle!}}\n|de={{tt|Pure Enton-Power!|Pure Psyduck-power!}}\n|nl={{tt|Een Beetje Water Erbij|Add a little bit water}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Combat aquatique|Aquatic battle}}\n|he=להוסיף קצת מים{{tt|lehosif ktsat mayim|Add some water}}\n|it={{tt|Incontri subacquei|Underwater matches}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Batalha Sub-Aquática|Underwater Battle}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|É só Adicionar Água|Just Add Water}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Solo agregue agua!|Just add water!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Combates bajo el agua|Underwater battles}}\n|pl={{tt|Dodaj tylko wody|Just add water}}\n|hi=उंडर्वातर मुकाबला! {{tt|\'\'Underwater Muqabla!\'\'|Underwater Battle!}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n}}\n\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP255 |\nprevtitle=Why?
