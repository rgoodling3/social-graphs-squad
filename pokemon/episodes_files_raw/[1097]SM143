It first aired in Japan on October 13, 2019<!-- and is scheduled to air in the United States on *day*-->.\n{{spoilers}}\n<!--\n==Blurb==\nOfficial Blurb from Pokémon.com goes here, with source link-->\n<!--Please do not alter the blurb to fix any errors, they are meant to be presented as they are on the official site.-->\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[Full Battle]] between {{Ash}} and {{an|Professor Kukui}} continues as {{p|Lucario}} foils {{AP|Naganadel}}\'s {{m|X-Scissor}} with {{m|Close Combat}}. Ash retaliates with an onslaught of {{m|Sludge Bomb}}s, but this fails to affect Lucario since it is immune to {{type|Poison}} attacks. Lucario uses {{m|Dragon Pulse}}, which Naganadel swiftly dodges. It reappears behind Lucario to land a surprise {{m|Thunderbolt}}, but Lucario manages to brace itself and emerges unscathed before using Close Combat again. This time, however, Naganadel\'s X-Scissor hits Lucario. Lucario then uses {{m|Extreme Speed}}, dodging Naganadel\'s X-Scissors before striking its opponent from above. As the dust settles, Naganadel rises into the air once again. The two sides use Dragon Pulse, with the attacks canceling each other out. Lucario prepares to use another Close Combat as Naganadel rushes in with X-Scissor. While Lucario holds back Naganadel\'s main stinger, Naganadel flicks out its other two needles and hits Lucario with Dragon Pulse. Lucario tries to recover, but it collapses in defeat. Naganadel is thrilled with its battle debut victory, spinning around in celebration. Professor Kukui is impressed with the round, remarking that Ash used [[SM142|his earlier strategy]] to defeat {{AP|Melmetal}} against him.\n\nThe two opponents decide to resume their fiery clash, sending out {{AP|Torracat}} and {{TP|Professor Kukui|Incineroar}}. Torracat’s bell is still flaring from absorbing Incineroar\'s {{m|Blast Burn}} from their earlier clash. Both sides slowly prowl around one another, exchanging intense stares as they size each other up. The rivalry flares again as Torracat and Incineroar approach with {{m|Flame Charge}} and {{m|Darkest Lariat}} respectively. Torracat manages to knock Incineroar off-balance before rebounding to land a direct Flame Charge on it. Ash orders a {{m|Fire Fang}}, but it is sent backwards when its attack collides with Incineroar\'s Throat Chop.\n\nIncineroar uses {{m|Bulk Up}} in anticipation for the increasingly heated clashes. It blocks a {{m|Fire Blast}} with its bare hands before crushing the flames with its brute strength. Torracat leaps into action with Flame Charge, first striking Incineroar in the chest before going for an attack from above and then behind to knock Incineroar onto the ground. Following the triple hit, Torracat rushes in for a Fire Fang only to grabbed by Incineroar. As Torracat attempts to paw at its opponent, Incineroar hits him backwards with a Throat Chop. Torracat picks itself up and erupts into flames, and Incineroar does the same. Torracat scores a direct hit with {{m|Revenge}}, knocking Incineroar to its knees.\n\nThe heat swells as Incineroar gets up causing both sides to glow with a vibrant red hue. Both Ash and Kukui equip their [[Z-Ring]]s with their [[Firium Z]]s, setting the battlefield alight with a double {{m|Inferno Overdrive}}. As the fireball continues to swirl, Torracat and Incineroar are ordered to rush inside. A massive explosion occurs as Incineroar\'s Throat Chop and Torracat\'s Revenge collide. Both sides remain standing, breathing heavily from their exhaustive efforts. Torracat wills itself to resist collapsing, though Incineroar is overwhelmed and collapses knocked out. Torracat commemorates the victory over its long-time rival with a mighty roar as it [[Evolution|evolves]] into an Incineroar. Ash rushes to officially congratulate his newly-evolved Pokémon only to notice Incineroar is frozen in position. [[Hala]] observes carefully before fatefully ruling Ash’s Incineroar also out of the match.\n\nKukui congratulates Ash, but reminds him the battle isn\'t over yet as he still has one Pokémon left. As he prepares his {{i|Poké Ball}} to send out his final team member, {{DL|Guardian deities (anime)|Tapu Koko}} suddenly arrives in [[Manalo Stadium]]. The guardian deity slaps away Kukui\'s Poké Ball, and Ash realizes it came here to battle them. Tapu Koko agrees, so Kukui allows for the surprising addition to let it be his final Pokémon against Ash. The crowd erupts into cheers as the already intense Full Battle becomes an unprecedented spectacle of power. Pikachu is prepared to take on his {{t|Electric}} rival, though Ash instead calls on Naganadel for assistance. As Naganadel prepares for battle, Tapu Koko\'s {{a|Electric Surge|Ability}} transforms the battlefield into an {{m|Electric Terrain}}.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
