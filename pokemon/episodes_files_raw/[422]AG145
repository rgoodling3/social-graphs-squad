May and Brock want to try some awesome noodles. Ash and Max want to check out a Fighting-type Pokémon dojo. Unable to fully agree, the two groups split up.\n\nMay and Brock arrive at the noodle place only to see the chef, Kyle, being dragged away by a girl named Terri. May, desperate for food, follows them with Brock. Meanwhile, Team Rocket have come up with their own noodle cart scheme, but abandon it when they see Ash and Max headed for the dojo.\n\nAt the dojo, Ash and Max are quickly drafted by Master Hamm into being students at the dojo, even though they just wanted a demonstration. Terri happens to drag Kyle in while Ash, Max, and Pikachu are cleaning the dojo\'s floors. After May and Brock arrive, it is finally explained that Kyle is the son of Master Hamm, and that Hamm wants Kyle to take over the dojo. Kyle would rather make noodles. Unwilling to compromise, they decide to have a Pokémon battle to sort it out. Master Hamm\'s back gives out as they start, so Ash offers to take his place. Kyle doesn\'t like this, so May takes Kyle\'s place.\n\nAsh and May both practice, using Master Hamm and Kyle\'s Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan. They soon begin a formal battle, but are interrupted by Team Rocket, determined to steal the Fighting-type Pokémon. Terri steps in with her Hitmontop, freeing Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan just before Pikachu sends Team Rocket blasting off.\n\nEveryone is disappointed that the battle wasn\'t finished, and Kyle admits he\'s been trying to make noodles as good as his father\'s all along. Terri offers to take over the dojo, since it happens that managing a dojo like that was her dream. It turns out that Master Hamm\'s dream was to sell noodles from a cart. In the end, everyone gets what they want, including May, who gets to try some delicious noodles made by Master Hamm!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{an|May}} displays her newly acquired [[Ribbon]] as everyone is sitting on tires in a nearby field. {{Ash}} wants to hurry off to the [[Battle Arena]], though May suggests that go to lunch at a noodle restaurant famous for its "Battle Noodles." [[Max]] shows Ash an advertisement for a free battle demo of "The Strongest" at the [[Fighting Dojo|Pokémon Dojo]]. The group then splits up, with May and {{an|Brock}} going to the noodle restaurant and Ash and Max going to the dojo.\n\nOutside the restaurant, May and Brock see a long line of people. The noodle chef, [[Kyle Hamm|Kyle]] and a girl named [[Terri]] exit the restaurant and appear to be arguing. Terri orders Kyle go with her to the dojo, but he is more concerned about his restaurant customers. Terri pulls Kyle away, which instantly annoys the line of waiting customer. As May becomes fired up, both she and Brock dash off to follow Kyle and Terri. Meanwhile, {{TRT}} has constructed a stand to sell noodles. As they argue about who will cook, they see Ash and Max walking on the sidewalk. [[Jessie]] and [[James]] dash off after them and leave a bewildered {{MTR}} to man the noodle stand. Upset, Meowth complains about how he always has to do all the work.\n\nAsh and Max arrive at the Dojo, which appears to be empty. Max wonders if this is really the place, when suddenly an old man leaps outside to greet them, demonstrating some martial arts moves before introducing himself as the Dojo owner, [[Master Hamm]]. Max then mentions that Ash made the Top 8 of the [[Ever Grande Conference]], surprising the master. Assuming that Ash wants to apply as a student, Master Hamm starts pushing him inside the dojo. Team Rocket looks on from a nearby tree, and they plot to steal all the {{type|Fighting}} Pokémon and {{AP|Pikachu}} too.\n\nAsh and Max are quickly put to work cleaning the floors by hand when Terri drags Kyle inside with May and Brock in tow. The group are surprised to be reunited again. Terri than recognizes May as the winner of the recent [[Saffron City]] [[Pokémon Contest]], saying that she watched her on [[television]]. Brock tries to flirt with Terri, but she goes over and asks Master Hamm about the "new Trainers," whom he reveals are his new students. Ash and Max reply that they only wanted to see some Fighting Pokémon. Terri scolds Master Hamm for making his guests do cleaning, but he says he only did so because Kyle, his son and unwilling heir to the Dojo, refuses to do the work. Terri apologizes for the scene and introduces herself to Ash and {{ashfr}}. She says that she is the Dojo\'s only student, which in the past had hundreds. If Kyle does not take over the Dojo, Master Hamm would have no choice but to close it down. Brock tries to interrupt the arguing with his own "solution": he will marry Terri and take over instead. However, he is ignored and the fighting continues.\n\nMaster Hamm says that the only way to settle this is with a {{pkmn|battle}}. If Kyle loses, he agrees to take over the Dojo, but if he wins, he is free to do whatever he wants. Kyle accepts and makes Terri the "Contest judge", and she reluctantly accepts the duty. Master Hamm calls upon {{p|Hitmonlee}} and Kyle releases {{p|Hitmonchan}} onto the field. May yells to Kyle that she is rooting for him so that he can make noodles for her. Kyle tells Hitmonchan to use {{m|Mach Punch}}, knocking Hitmonlee back. It quickly recovers as Master Hamm jumps into the air and kicks while directing Hitmonlee to use {{m|Jump Kick}}, but he suddenly injures his back, abruptly ending the match. Master Hamm remains determined to settle the matter, so Ash offers to fight with Hitmonlee in his place. Kyle argues that the battle would be pointless if he is battling a replacement, so May decides to step in for him. In return for a victory, Kyle offers to cook up some delicious Battle Noodles just for May. Both then go outside to train their Pokémon for the battle.\n\nOutside of the dojo, Team Rocket is spying on Ash\'s practice battle between {{p|Hariyama}} and Hitmonlee. Hitmonlee dodges each of Hariyama\'s {{m|Arm Thrust}}s and lands a successful blow with {{m|Rolling Kick}}. Hariyama spins uncontrollably as Hitmonlee then delivers a {{m|High Jump Kick}} which knocks Hariyama back and on top of Team Rocket. With Hariyama defeated, it is returned to its {{i|Poké Ball}}. Master Hamm takes note of Ash\'s skill and says that if Ash were to take over the Dojo, he could go off to follow his dreams. Max says that he thought he was doing this to get Kyle to take over the Dojo.\n\nOn another field outside the Dojo, {{p|Breloom}} and Hitmonchan are in battle, dodging each other\'s blows. Breloom uses {{m|Stun Spore}} and Hitmonchan quickly dodges, though Team Rocket get caught in the attack and are subsequently paralyzed. Breloom then approaches with {{m|Sky Uppercut}}, and with Kyle’s instruction, May has Hitmonchan strike first. Kyle suggests a Mach Punch, which Hitmonchan executes and knocks Breloom out. Terri suggests that Kyle just take over the Dojo, but he refuses to run what he calls a dump. Terri is incensed by the insult and Kyle says that he didn\'t mean it. Terri quickly apologizes, saying that she always thought that they would run the Dojo together someday. May tells Brock that she thinks Terri might have feelings for Kyle, and Brock comes to the same realization and enters into an emotional heartbreak over Terri.\n\nBack inside the Dojo, the battle is about to begin between Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan as Kyle and Master Hamm encourage their respective representatives. Ash commands Hitmonlee to use a Rolling Kick and May tells Hitmonchan to use Sky Uppercut. Both attacks hit their marks, sending both Pokémon to the ground. Master Hamm compliments May for using that strategy to reduce damage from the Rolling Kick. Kyle mentions that the trick with Fighting-type Pokémon is utilizing your opponent\'s energy. Hitmonchan uses Mach Punch, but Hitmonlee dodges and strikes with Jump Kick, knocking Hitmonchan back to the wall. Prompted by Kyle for a counterattack, May has Hitmonchan use {{m|Comet Punch}}. Hitmonlee dodges the first few swings, but is eventually struck a few times and falls onto its back. As Hitmonlee struggles to its feet, it sent back by a follow up Mach Punch. Master Hamm yells at Ash to keep his guard up. With her eyes ablaze, May firmly declares that she wants those Battle Noodles and no one will stop her from having them. A little concerned, Ash tells her to calm down. Hitmonlee gets back up and stands wearily. Hitmonlee suddenly gets up close with {{m|Agility}} and readies a Mach Punch. Hitmonlee quickly jumps and knees Hitmonchan in the face with High Jump Kick. Master Hamm tells an astonished Kyle to say goodbye to his noodle shop. Kyle says that the battle is not over until one of the Pokémon uses "that attack," which Master Hamm says is the strongest one they both know.\n\nBoth Ash and May call for it to be done, so Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee get ready to use {{m|Focus Punch}}. They launch at each other, but suddenly the roof caves in. Team Rocket makes their entrance and recites their {{motto}}. Their mecha looks like two massive bowls of noodles attached at the bottom, with wheels and one mechanical arm holding a pair of chopsticks and the other holding a net with Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee inside. Ash and May tell them to let the Pokémon go, but Team Rocket turns and begins to make their getaway. Terri releases her {{p|Hitmontop}} to use {{m|Rapid Spin}} to break the net, releasing the two Pokémon. Terri tells it to then use {{m|Mega Kick}}, which destroys the top half of the mecha and leaves Team Rocket vulnerable in the cockpit. Ash then has Pikachu use {{m|Thunderbolt}}, blowing up the mecha and sending Team Rocket blasting off again.\n\nAfter the destructive interruption, Terri asks Kyle why making noodles is so important. Kyle explains that it all started with a bowl of noodles his dad made for him when he was younger. He wanted to make noodles just like his father\'s and run a successful business, showing everyone that he is capable of perfection. Master Hamm realizes his son\'s vision and gives his blessing for Kyle to pursue his dreams. Father and son apologize and embrace one another, and Master Hamm says that all he wanted was for Kyle to be happy. Terri then offers to take over the Dojo, which has always been her dream, and Master Hamm accepts. Ash asks Master Hamm to finally reveal his dream, and he admits that he wants to travel the world selling noodles from a mobile stand. Kyle likes the idea, but asks that he make the same noodles that inspired him before he leaves. Master Hamm agrees and soon prepares noodles for everyone. After eating the delicious noodles, Ash and his friends bid the others farewell and head off towards the Battle Arena.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} leave [[Saffron City]].\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Terri]]\n* [[Kyle Hamm]]\n* [[Master Hamm]]\n* Noodle house customers\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:PTC AG145.png|thumb|200px|right|Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]\n[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]: {{p|Absol}}\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Chimecho}} ({{OP|James|Chimecho}})\n* {{p|Hitmonlee}} ([[Master Hamm]]\'s; lent to {{Ash}})\n* {{p|Hitmonchan}} ([[Kyle Hamm|Kyle]]\'s; lent to {{an|May}})\n* {{p|Hitmontop}} ([[Terri]]\'s)\n* {{p|Breloom}} ([[Fighting Dojo]]\'s)\n* {{p|Hariyama}} ([[Fighting Dojo]]\'s)\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[Ready Go!]] is played while {{Ash}} and {{an|May}} train their lent Pokémon.\n* This is the season finale of [[S08|Pokémon: Advanced Battle]].\n** This is also the last episode dubbed by [[4Kids Entertainment]], and the last episode to air on {{DL|Pokémon in the United States|Kids\' WB!}}.\n* Until \'\'[[SM001|Alola to New Adventure!]]\'\', this was the last episode that did not premiere on [[Pokémon in the United States|Cartoon Network]], 521 episodes later.\n* Until \'\'[[SM044|A Dream Encounter!]]\'\', this was the last episode without an extended "To Be Continued" screen in the dub, 564 episodes later.\n* [[Maddie Blaustein]] revealed that {{MTR}} says "{{TRT}}\'s Blaustein off again!" as Team Rocket is blasting off, a possible homage to her last performance as the character.
