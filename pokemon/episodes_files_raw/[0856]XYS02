It isn’t long before they encounter another Trainer named Steven, and Alain can’t resist challenging him to a Pokémon battle. Steven unleashes his Metagross, who has the ability to Mega Evolve just like Charizard!\n\nThe exciting battle is interrupted when a Pyroar bursts onto the scene. It’s soon followed by its Trainer, Alain’s boss Lysandre, who owns Lysandre Labs in the Kalos region. He’s interested in collaborating with Steven, the Champion of the Hoenn region, to research the power of Mega Evolution and to harness that power for peaceful means.\n\nTogether, the group travels to an ancient ruin where Lysandre and Steven combine their research to discover a massive, glowing Giant Rock that resembles an immense Key Stone. Lysandre calls in his team of scientists via helicopter to begin studying their find, but their activities summon Rayquaza from the sky. Unexpectedly, this Legendary Pokémon Mega Evolves—without the help of a Trainer—and begins to attack the ruins!\n\nMega Charizard X and Mega Metagross battle back, but Mega Rayquaza launches a massive attack and flies away. In the aftermath, the group is surprised to see that the Giant Rock is missing. Based on Lysandre’s readings, he sends Alain to Rustboro City to track it down, and Steven and Mairin come along for the journey!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{incomplete plot}}\nLanding in [[Hoenn]], [[Alain]] and [[Mairin]] walk down a foggy mountain. The duo encounter [[Steven Stone]], whom Alain challenges in a [[Mega Evolution]] battle. Steven accepts, taking out his {{TP|Steven|Metagross}}. The two [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] their Pokémon, and fight a worthy battle. While Mega Metagross and Mega {{TP|Alain|Charizard}} X are about to finish each other off, a {{TP|Lysandre|Pyroar}} unleashes a {{m|Flamethrower}} and interrupts the two. The Pokémon belonged to [[Lysandre]], a businessman who owns a lab in the [[Kalos]] region. He is revealed to be Alain\'s boss, and Alain tries to shut Mairin out of his affairs. In a flashback, Alain contacted {{an|Professor Sycamore}} about {{p|Charmander}}\'s evolution to {{p|Charmeleon}}. He was trying to find a [[Charizardite X|Charizardite]] in some ruins and encounters Lysandre, who proposes him a deal: a Charizardite in exchange for his help. Before leaving, he tells Alain that he has to be the strongest. Back in the present, Alain and Mairin follow Lysandre and Steven up to [[Mt. Pyre]].\n\nSteven reveals that he traveled in search of stones as he was interested in Mega Evolution. He and Lysandre show to each other two different wooden tablets. One half shows the location of the gate and the other half shows the way to open it: a [[Mega Stone]]. Both Trainers take one pillar, revealing a stairway that leads to the mountain. At the top, they find some ruins in search of the [[Giant Rock]]. Steven and Alain find two daises and activate them, revealing a crystal.\n\nThe group finally finds the Giant Rock. Lysandre talks in his communicator, and a helicopter flies in. A science team starts researching the power of the Giant Rock, and in the process the sky turns dark, and {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Rayquaza}} appears. A sudden glow engulfs it, and it Mega Evolves into Mega Rayquaza, awakening {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Groudon (XY)|Groudon}} and {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Kyogre (XY)|Kyogre}}. Mega Rayquaza is in a rage, destroying everything in its path. Alain and Steven take out and Mega Evolve their Charizard and Metagross. Mega Charizard X fails to use Flamethrower against Rayquaza, and Metagross fails to attack as well, and Rayquaza counters with {{m|Draco Meteor}}. It then flies away. The ruins are destroyed, Alain is injured, and the Giant Rock is gone. With Rayquaza on the loose, Lysandre instructs Alain and Mairin to head to [[Rustboro City]] and investigate there, with Steven tagging along. In secret, he instructs Alain to stay close to the Champion, as his knowledge of Mega Evolution may prove to be useful.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
