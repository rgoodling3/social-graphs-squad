A Pokémon from Space!?\'\') is the 87th episode of the {{series|Advanced Generation}}, and the 361st episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on July 29, 2004 and in the United States on August 20, 2005.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/07_47-crazy-as-a-lunatone/-->\n<i>Ken and Mary of the Pokémon Mystery Club (PMC) are once again looking for a Pokémon from outer space, checking the site of a meteor crash. A Lunatone emerges and zaps them, erasing their memories of the encounter.\n\nMeanwhile, Ash and friends reach Volley Town, finding it strangely deserted. They walk into the Pokémon Center for assistance but Nurse Joy is zoned out and unhelpful. Brock doesn\'t believe it\'s the real Nurse Joy.\n\nTeam Rocket sneaks into the Pokémon Center, but bump into Ash and friends. When Nurse Joy approaches, they all run, and hide in a storage room. There, they run into the frightened Lunatone. It tries to use Psychic on them, but passes out instead.\n\nNurse Joy returns to normal and treats Lunatone. It needs moonlight to survive, so they decide to take it up to nearby Camerupt Point where the full moon shines. They hide the Pokémon from the PMC in a cart and pull it up the hill, but are cut off by Team Rocket. Team Rocket gets into a fight with the Pokémon Mystery Club.\n\nThe PMC sends Team Rocket blasting off. Pikachu, Mudkip, and Beautifly team up to drive off the PMC, but they won\'t be defeated. The full moon rises and Lunatone charges up and send the pair off with Hidden Power. The kids then bid farewell to Lunatone.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAt the crack of dawn, a meteor crashes on Earth and sends out a shock wave felt for miles. The [[Pokémon Mystery Club]], which consists of Ken and Mary, are psyched about this, so they hurry to check it out. Taking out their flashlights and equipment, they use their skills to construct a mechanical vehicle with robotic arms and quickly locate their target. Next, they use a missile launcher to blast it enough to get samples. Out of the meteor comes a bright glow, and within seconds, the Moon {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} {{p|Lunatone}} rises up from the rocks. The PMC are thrilled by the rare find, though Lunatone proves too agile to catch. As Lunatone sees its chance, it uses telekinesis to lift the heavy vehicle, distracting Ken and Mary. They desperately try zapping it, but Lunatone just absorbs the energy. Lunatone then opens its eye and freezes Ken and Mary in the red glow of {{m|Hypnosis}} before fleeing to nearby [[Volley Town]].\n\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} are making their way to [[Lilycove City]] and they decide to stop at Volley Town, ostensibly to rest at a [[Pokémon Center]]. When they arrive, Volley Town resembles more of a ghost town with its empty streets. They discover that the Pokémon Center is also deserted, without even a [[Nurse Joy]] behind the counter to welcome them. Then, she emerges from the back room, having heard them, she came to investigate. When asked to heal Pokémon or let them stay, Nurse Joy rudely refuses, and tells them that this is a bad choice for a Pokémon Center, and walks out. Everyone is flabbergasted at Nurse Joy’s strange behavior. {{an|Brock}}, however, considers himself the "Nurse Joy expert" and takes out his Joy photo album from his [[bag|backpack]]. He claims to know them all very well, and \'\'no\'\' Joy would ever act like that without reason. But anyway, since Volley Town Joy is being so stubborn, they decide to enjoy a good meal while at the Center.\n\nPeople and Pokémon alike chow down, but {{TP|Brock|Lombre}} suddenly seems to be picking up something and walks over to investigate it. Seconds later, Brock realizes that Lombre is missing and its dish is still full. Two figures appear from behind the bushes. Instantly they suspect {{TRT}}, but are shocked to realize that these people have a Pokédex machine they are using to get info on Lombre. After getting the info, they decide to remove their masks, and reveal themselves as Ken and Mary from the PMC, a duo which Ash and Brock remember from [[EP246|when they helped]] a {{p|Cleffa}}. Ken and Mary inform them about the meteor crash and their encounter with a Lunatone, a Pokémon from outer space. Thinking fast, they say their goodbyes and rush off to look for it.\n\nThe group decide to return to the Center to rest up, and the Rocket trio, while spying on them in the bushes, they decide to follow them. Unfortunately for Team Rocket, it\'s closed by the time they get there, so they resort to climbing through a window. However, they make a bit too big of a crash when landing inside.  Naturally, Ash and company investigate the crash and come to a long hallway where they spot the mysterious shadows. [[Max]] wonders aloud if that it is the Pokémon from outer space, though the Rocket trio confirm their identities and intentions to reach the meteor first. Joy\'s voice interrupts them, and nervously, Team Rocket and the group go into hiding in the Center\'s storage room.  A rustling sound coming from some nearby boxes causes [[James]] to turn his flashlight in that direction and he discovers Lunatone.  Ash checks his [[Pokédex]] for info, and it classifies Lunatone as the "Meteor Pokémon", affirming its extraterrestrial origins. Suddenly, the light clicks on, and Joy appears in the doorway. She’s definitely surprised they found Lunatone and is even more surprised when Team Rocket threaten to capture it. Sending out {{TP|James|Cacnea}} and {{TP|Jessie|Seviper}}, they try a combined {{m|Needle Arm}} and {{m|Bite}}. Lunatone opens its eye and easily takes care of them with a {{m|Psychic}}, [[fainting|knocking them both out]]. However, after such a powerful attack, Lunatone collapses on the floor, tired out. Brock offers to help Joy with Lunatone’s treatment. Meanwhile, {{MTR}} is conversing with Lunatone in the corner and genuinely concerned for it. However, he is overruled by his teammates, who insist on using force.  They command their respective Pokémon to use Needle Arm and {{m|Poison Tail}}. Realizing that Lunatone is too tired to battle, Ash has {{AP|Pikachu}} interfere and blast all Team Rocket off with a {{m|Thunderbolt}}.\n\nWhile examining Lunatone at the table, Joy declares that it\'s in a really weak condition, and there’s only one way they can heal it. They will have to expose it to moonlight, and she points that [[Camerupt Point]] is the ideal location. As they embark on their journey through the mountainous pass, they bring Lunatone with them in a big cardboard box on wheels, along with some other aid equipment. Pikachu is in there too, to keep an eye on Lunatone and make sure it’s okay, and that it doesn’t go crazy.  Suddenly, they run into the PMC once again, who ask if they’ve seen the meteor or the mysterious Moon-shaped Pokémon. The group leads Ken and Mary on a wild goose chase, giving random directions, and then passing by, glad to get them out of their way. Ken remains suspicious, so they take out their kit and once again build a machine to help them find it. The group and Joy have nearly reached the top, and Max is the first to notice a distant formation in the rocks which resemble the back of a Camerupt. Joy affirms they have reached Camerupt Point, adding that the moon should rise right about now. \n\nA big round yellow object rising above the mountains proves only to be Team Rocket in their balloon, still not having given up. As they stretch out their mechanical claw to grab Lunatone, Ash leaps to intervene, but the PMC in their own mecha come in between in-between Team Rocket and Lunatone first.  After a bit of verbal arguing, Ken and Mary’s vehicle shakes Team Rocket\'s balloon up a bit, and proceed to send Team Rocket off. Ash and his friends then turn their attention to stopping the PMC. Pikachu tries an {{m|Iron Tail}}, but is knocked back by the machine’s arm. {{TP|Brock|Mudkip}} uses {{m|Water Gun}}, hitting them a little, but suffers the same fate. {{an|May}} tries a different strategy, using her {{TP|May|Beautifly}}’s {{m|Silver Wind}}, dealing them a lot of damage. Mudkip and Pikachu use Water Gun and Thunderbolt again, though their efforts fail to make any difference. Suddenly, Joy notices that the moon is rising. Everyone watches as it slowly rises, and Lunatone uses its {{m|Moonlight}} technique, replenishing all its energy. Lunatone uses its {{m|Hidden Power}}, destroying the machine, and blasting the PMC off. Ash expresses pride for being involved in solving such a huge mystery, and helping a rare Pokémon like Lunatone. However, they soon part, as Lunatone is headed back to its distant home beyond the atmosphere. Everyone waves and slowly watches as Lunatone drifts off.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{pkmn|Mystery Club|Ken}} and {{pkmn|Mystery Club|Mary}} from the [[Pokémon Mystery Club]] return, with {{an|May}} and [[Max]] meeting them for the first time.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n=====TV episode debuts=====\n* {{p|Lunatone}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* {{pkmn|Mystery Club|Ken}}\n* {{pkmn|Mystery Club|Mary}}\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:PTC AG087.png|thumb|200px|Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]\n[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]: {{p|Gulpin}}\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Chimecho}} ({{OP|James|Chimecho}})\n* {{p|Swellow}} ({{OP|Ash|Swellow}})\n* {{p|Grovyle}} ({{OP|Ash|Grovyle}})\n* {{p|Corphish}} ({{OP|Ash|Corphish}})\n* {{p|Torkoal}} ({{OP|Ash|Torkoal}})\n* {{p|Combusken}} ({{OP|May|Combusken}})\n* {{p|Beautifly}} ({{OP|May|Beautifly}})\n* {{p|Skitty}} ({{OP|May|Skitty}})\n* {{p|Bulbasaur}} ({{OP|May|Bulbasaur}})\n* {{p|Forretress}} ({{OP|Brock|Forretress}})\n* {{p|Mudkip}} ({{OP|Brock|Mudkip}})\n* {{p|Lombre}} ({{OP|Brock|Lombre}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Cacnea}} ({{OP|James|Cacnea}})\n* {{p|Lunatone}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* The design of [[Pokémon Mystery Club|Ken and Mary]]\'s [[Pokédex]] is based on the [[Game Boy Advance SP]]. It uses the "Dexter" voice rather than the "Dextette" of {{Ash}} and {{an|May}}\'s [[Hoenn]] Pokédex.\n* When {{an|Brock}} shows the others a book with pictures of other [[Nurse Joy]]s, the tanned one from \'\'[[EP092|The Joy of Pokémon]]\'\' is shown. However, at the time of her appearance, Brock was with [[Professor Ivy]] and did not travel with Ash. However, it is possible he learned about her through independent research.\n* The episode name is a play on the phrases "\'\'crazy as a lunatic\'\'" and "\'\'crazy as a loon\'\'".\n* This is the first episode to use music from \'\'[[PK12|Gotta Dance!!]]\'\'. However, the background music is replaced in the dub.\n* [[Jessie\'s Dustox]] is the only current party Pokémon not featured in this episode.\n\n===Errors===\n* When {{TP|James|Chimecho}} appears during {{TRT}}\'s motto, it seems to have two "spikes" on its "back" rather than one.\n* During the battle between Team Rocket and the {{p|Lunatone}}, the \'R\' on Jessie\'s shirt is reversed.\n* Either there are two Pokémon Centers, or the scenario of the Pokémon Center changes from one place to another during the episode. At first, when the group enters the Center, there is a building behind them. Later, they are hiding behind a bush, right where the building was.\n* When Team Rocket blasts off the first time, Chimecho is heard even though it hadn\'t come out of its Poké Ball. After Team Rocket\'s second blast off (by the PMC), it is heard again.\n* When everyone is eating, {{TP|Brock|Lombre}} is eating with the other Pokémon, but when {{an|Brock}} notices it\'s missing, its bowl is isolated from the rest.\n\n<gallery>\nAG087 Error.png|Chimecho\'s extra "spike"\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n====[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]====\n* Question: Trainers, which one of these Pokémon is the best choice to battle {{p|Illumise}}?\n* Choices: {{p|Parasect}}, {{p|Gulpin}}, {{p|Lanturn}}\n* Answer: OK, Trainers!
