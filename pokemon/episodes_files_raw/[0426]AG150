It was first broadcast in Japan on November 3, 2005 and in the United States on September 23, 2006.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/09_05-mays-egg-cellent-adventure/-->\n<i>As Ash and his friends head for the next Battle Frontier stop, May spots a lovely farm. But when she takes a closer look, she\'s zapped by Voltorb! The Voltorb guard the farm, where a friendly couple and their daughter Nicolette raise Pokémon Eggs. Nicolette has a Vileplume and wants to be a Coordinator, except she\'s afraid to leave home. She\'s not afraid to battle May and Munchlax, however—but May wins, proving her ribbon-winning skills!\n\nTeam Rocket hatches a plan to raid the farm by sneaking Meowth and an egg-shaped robot inside. The robot then transforms and swipes the Pokémon Eggs, including one that\'s about to hatch! Once Team Rocket\'s villainy is out in the open, our heroes must stop them without hurting the stolen Eggs. Nicolette has Vileplume knock Team Rocket for a loop, and after some scrambling around the Eggs are safely retrieved.\n\nTo everyone\'s relief, a Vulpix emerges safe and sound from the Pokémon Egg that was ready to hatch. Nicolette decides she\'s ready now to set off on her own and become a Coordinator—and someday compete against May! As for May, Nicolette\'s parents give her a Pokémon Egg to thank her for all her help. She resumes her journey with a new sense of excitement and anticipation!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{ashfr|The group}} are heading to the [[Battle Dome]], fresh from {{Ash}} winning the [[Symbol|Guts Symbol]]. {{an|May}} steps off the path to admire a nearby farm, but two {{p|Voltorb}} approach from behind and deliver a fierce {{type|Electric}} attack. With a pitchfork in hand, [[Nicolette]] confront the group and reveals that the Voltorb are trained to attack trespassers. However she quickly changes her tone, recognizing May from her win at the [[Saffron City]] [[Pokémon Contest]]. Her parents, [[Christopher and Jeannie]] emerge from the house and invites everyone to join them tea. Christopher reveals that Nicolette wants to be a {{pkmn|Coordinator}}, but she does not feel ready to leave home. Max asks what kind of farm the family runs, and Christopher reveals that they are farm ranchers, raising [[Pokémon Egg]]s. He offers to give them a tour of the ranch.\n\nAs Nicolette carries a bucket of grass out, she notices Max grooming {{TP|May|Munchlax}} and considers having a test {{pkmn|battle}}. She becomes startled when Max responds to her whispers, admitting that Munchlax belongs to his sister. May comes out and talks to Nicolette about {{pkmn|training}} to become a Pokémon Coordinator. Nicolette challenges her to a battle, pitting {{p|Vileplume}} against Munchlax, instantly alarming May as Munchlax has no battle experience. Vileplume attacks with {{m|Petal Dance}}, {{status|confuse|confusing}} Munchlax. Despite that, it still pulls off a {{m|Metronome}} attack, which unfortunately turns into a useless {{m|Splash}} attack. Vileplume follows up with {{m|Stun Spore}} to {{status|Paralysis|paralyze}} Munchlax and cripple it further. Vileplume lands another direct hit with {{m|Bullet Seed}}, leading Nicolette to mock May for her bad performance. May gets fired up and declares that she just needs to focus. Munchlax responds in kind, recovering from the attack and charging forward, executing a {{m|Focus Punch}} attack against the off-guard Vileplume and sending it back. As Max points out the attack, May orders Munchlax to use {{m|Solar Beam}}. Vileplume ducks the attack, but it makes a glancing blow, still enough to [[fainting|knock it out]]. Nicolette tries to brush the defeat, but she is amazed at May\'s skill. May celebrates her win with her surprisingly powerful Munchlax. Ash and {{an|Brock}} call to them to check out the Eggs.\n\nInside one of the storage room, Eggs line the shelves and astound the group. Some of the Eggs belong to other {{pkmn|Trainer}}s while others belong to the family. Christopher asks May to share her traveling stories with Nicolette to motivate her. He points out that one Egg is ready to hatch and the group offers to help hatch it. {{TRT}} is watching nearby, staking out the ranch and the Voltorb sentries. [[James]] creates a plan to steal the Eggs, and by nightfall the trio put their scheme into motion. The group’s dinner with the family is interrupted by a large surge of electricity, alerting them to a potential trespasser. They go outside to find a very large Egg. A note falls forward and asks them to take care of the Egg. They manage to use a cart to wheel the giant Egg inside as [[Jessie]] and James, electrified from the Voltorb attacks, watch as their plan is set.\n\nAfter putting the giant Egg away, the family shows the group to an incubator that holds an Egg close to hatching. Ash and his friends offer to patrol the area. As they do, May finds Nicolette taking care of an Egg by polishing it. As May begins to help polish Eggs, Nicolette begins to open up to May about wanting to become a Coordinator. She\'s scared that she will not succeed, but May admits that she started as a beginner not even liking Pokémon and built up. Despite that, Nicolette is still reluctant to leave home to pursue her dreams.\n\nTeam Rocket\'s balloon flies over the farm as Jessie radios in to {{MTR}}, who is stowed away inside the [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|big Egg]]. Meowth activates it and uses mechanical arms to grab all the Eggs and put them into a basket. As Meowth begins to leave, he notices the parents taking care of the incubated Egg and decides to take it as well. The commotion alerts Nicolette and the kids to the situation. The Voltorb attempt to intervene, though Meowth\'s mecha knocks them out. Ash and friends catch up with the large Egg as Team Rocket\'s balloon comes down and hooks the mecha to the balloon. {{AP|Pikachu}} attempts to attack with {{m|Thunderbolt}}, but Nicolette stops him since it could destroy the Eggs. The balloon proceeds to take off. Following May’s suggestion, Nicolette has Vileplume use Stun Spore, effectively stopping Team Rocket without harming the Eggs. Vileplume follows up with Petal Dance which confuses Team Rocket and sends the balloon flying erratically, the vibrations destroying the basket and sending the Eggs into freefall. Everyone rushes to catch the sets, successfully doing so, but the glowing Egg falls out of reach. May sends out Munchlax to catch it, and the Egg bounces off its belly before Jeannie catches it. Meowth reactivates the mecha to try to retake the Eggs, but Vileplume\'s Bullet Seed destroys the arms. Both Munchlax and Vileplume use Solar Beam to destroy the balloon, but the mecha survives the blow. The mecha tries to flee, but Ash orders Pikachu to use {{m|Quick Attack}}. Pikachu speeds into action, with his stored electricity transforming the Quick Attack turning into an electrified version, as Pikachu learns to use {{m|Volt Tackle}}. Ash congratulates his buddy as it finishes the attack, blasting Team Rocket off.\n\nAs the sun rises, everyone watches the glowing Egg hatches, revealing a {{p|Vulpix}}. May compliments Nicolette on her combinations, and with the reassurance Nicolette makes the decision to go out on her journey. As Ash and friends prepare to depart, Christopher gives May an [[May\'s Eevee|Egg]] as a gift for helping Nicolette. May accepts the Egg, with Jeannie assuring her that it will be a wonderful surprise. The group wave goodbye to the ranching family and resume their journey towards the Battle Dome.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:May Eevee Egg.png|thumb|220px|May with her new Egg]]\n* [[May\'s Munchlax]] learns {{m|Focus Punch}} and uses {{m|Solar Beam}} for the first time.\n* {{Ash}}\'s {{AP|Pikachu}} learns {{m|Volt Tackle}}.\n* {{an|May}} receives a [[Pokémon Egg]] from [[Christopher and Jeannie]].\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Nicolette]]\n* [[Christopher and Jeannie]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Mime Jr.}} ({{OP|James|Mime Jr.}})\n* {{p|Munchlax}} ({{OP|May|Munchlax}})\n* {{p|Vileplume}} ([[Nicolette]]\'s)\n* {{p|Voltorb}} ([[Christopher and Jeannie]]\'s; ×2)\n* {{p|Vulpix}} ([[Christopher and Jeannie]]\'s; newly hatched)\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:Frontier Brains Lineup 2.png|thumb|220px|Greta in the opening]]\n* [[GLORY DAY ~That Shining Day~]] replaced [[Pokémon Counting Song]] as the [[List of Japanese ending themes|Japanese ending theme]]. While the lyrics are the same as the previous time this song was used, the visuals are completely new.\n* The Japanese opening animation changes a second time to include {{FB|Arena Tycoon|Greta}}.\n* [[James\'s Mime Jr.]] speaks {{MTR}}\'s parts in {{TRT}}\'s {{motto}}, except the last one.\n* As Team Rocket blasts off, [[James]] says in the Japanese version, "Our Egg plan was thwarted by an [[Egg Move]]!" The only way {{p|Pikachu}} can learn {{m|Volt Tackle}} in [[Generation III]] is through breeding, though [[Ash\'s Pikachu]] did not learn it through breeding and it is not an Egg Move in the traditional sense, which may be why it was removed in the dub.\n* When Team Rocket blasts off, Meowth [[Breaking the fourth wall|breaks the fourth wall]] in this episode when he says, "You\'re giving me a pain but I can\'t say where because kids watch this show."\n\n===Errors===\n<!--Do not add anything about May and Max not seeing eggs before despite seeing them in A Mudkip Mission. No one is expected to remember everything.-->\n* The [[Pokédex]] data for {{p|Vulpix}} on several games, and even in the anime, states that Vulpix is born with only one tail. However, the newly hatched Vulpix in this episode was born with six tails, just as it would in the games nevertheless.\n* [[May\'s Munchlax]]\'s eyelids were colored white in one scene.\n* In the {{pmin|Finland|Finnish}} dub, when Brock says that he, Ash and Christopher are going to check out the Eggs, he mistakenly speaks with Christopher\'s voice.\n* After Team Rocket got hit by {{p|Vileplume}}\'s {{m|Petal Dance}}, their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|Meowth balloon]] can be seen having two paws instead of its usual one.\n* In one scene, {{an|May}} is rubbing the Egg which is sitting next to an {{p|Aipom}} Egg as well as other Eggs on the top shelf, however in the next scene the Aipom Egg is gone, and none of the other Eggs on the shelf match the ones that were present in the other scene.\n* During the battle between May and Nicolette, Vileplume\'s Petal Dance caused Munchlax to be confused, despite the fact that Petal Dance is supposed to cause confusion to the Pokémon using the move. This also occurs during the battle with Team Rocket.\n\n<gallery>\nAG150 error.png|The balloon error\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=77FF77|bordercolor=55DD55\n|zh_cmn={{tt|撫養家與神奇寶貝蛋！|Breeder and Pokémon Egg!}}\n|da={{tt|Mays æg-stra gode eventyr|May\'s egg-stra good adventure}}\n|nl={{tt|Het Ei-zersterke avontuur van May!|The Egg-cellent Adventure of May!}}\n|de={{tt|Ein "Ei"-maliges Abenteuer!|An egg-citing adventure!}}\n|fi={{tt|May ja Pokémonmunat|May and the Pokémon eggs}}\n|fr={{tt|Qui vole un oeuf...|Who steals an egg...}} {{tt|*|The same French title was previously used in the episode EP264 - Mother Of All Battles!}}\n|hi=पोकेमोन के अंडे! {{tt|\'\'Pokemon ke ande!\'\'|Pokémon Eggs}}{{tt|*|Disney XD dub}}\n|he={{tt|הרפתקת הביצה|The Egg\'s Adventure}}\n|it={{tt|Gli allevatori di Uova di Pokémon|Pokémon Eggs breeder}}\n|ko={{tt|특명! 포켓몬의 알을 지켜라!|Special Command!
