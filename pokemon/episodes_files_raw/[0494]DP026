It first aired in Japan on April 5, 2007 as part of a one-hour special with [[DP027]], and in the United States on September 1, 2007.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/10_26-getting-the-pre-contest-titters/-->\n<i>With time running out before the start of the Floaroma Town Pokémon Contest, Dawn and Pachirisu are getting in as much training as they can. But it\'s not just Ash and Brock who are watching from the sidelines, because Dawn\'s friend Kenny is here to compete in the Contest, too! Both Dawn and Kenny are from Twinleaf Town, and Kenny is full of embarrassing stories about Dawn\'s childhood. What\'s more, he chose a Piplup for his first Pokémon, just like Dawn, but his Piplup is now a Prinplup with an attitude!\n\nTo add injury to insult, Kenny turns down a challenge from Dawn and asks to battle Ash and Pikachu instead. Pikachu should have the type advantage, but Kenny\'s Prinplup counters Pikachu\'s attacks by using its own moves in creative ways. It\'s so impressive that Team Rocket makes a grab for Prinplup—in order to boost Jessie\'s chances of Contest victory, James and Meowth are on a mission to steal Pokémon!\n\nPrinplup is unable to escape, so Dawn sends Piplup to stop Team Rocket. Piplup uses a newly-learned move, Whirlpool, to give Prinplup back some of its pep, and the two Water-type Pokémon then beat Team Rocket with a double Bubble Beam. Today\'s teamwork was terrific, but both Dawn and Kenny have their eye on winning tomorrow\'s Contest. What will happen once these old friends become new rivals...?</i>\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[Floaroma Town]] [[Pokémon Contest]] is one day away, and {{an|Dawn}} is {{pkmn|training}} hard. {{AP|Pikachu}} demonstrates to {{TP|Dawn|Pachirisu}} how to store electricity in order to gain more appeal. Pachirisu releases the electricity and creates a sparkle show similar to Pikachu. Pachirisu begs for Dawn\'s [[Poffin]], and she gives it and {{TP|Dawn|Piplup}} some. Both {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} want more Poffin, and Dawn refuses until they train some more. Pachirisu gets angry and uses {{m|Discharge}} on all of them. Pikachu stops Pachirisu with {{m|Thunderbolt}}, and Dawn\'s hair is a mess.\n\nSomeone calls out "Dee-Dee", and Dawn realizes that {{si|Kenny}} is there. {{Ash}} and {{an|Brock}} wonder why he called her Dee-Dee, and find out that Kenny is a childhood friend of Dawn. Kenny sits down with the group and sends out his {{TP|Kenny|Prinplup}}, the {{pkmn2|starter|first Pokémon}} he obtained on his {{pkmn|journey}}. While Ash checks his [[Pokédex]], Piplup walks up to Prinplup, and Prinplup slaps it away. Kenny apologizes and explains that Prinplup does not like when others get too close. As Piplup and Prinplup attempt a stare-down rivalry, Kenny reveals he too is a [[Pokémon Coordinator]], and tells Dawn that he watched the {{ci|Jubilife}} Contest on [[television]]. Dawn is surprised to hear that Kenny has become a Coordinator, as she does not remember him being interested in Pokémon Contests when they were younger. Kenny tells Dawn that he made it to the final round of his very first Pokémon Contest, but lost to [[Zoey]] and her {{TP|Zoey|Glameow}}.\n\nKenny asks Ash if he is competing in the Floaroma Contest, and he finds out about Ash\'s goal to conquer the [[Sinnoh League]]. Kenny suddenly switches topics about childhood stories, which irritates Dawn. He quickly brings up three stories that embarrass Dawn: her self-inflicted {{p|Chimchar}}-style haircut, her fumble during a childhood play, and wearing two different shoes and pajamas to school. Dawn loses it and challenges Kenny to a battle, but he ignores her for a battle against Ash\'s Pikachu, mainly for experience.\n\nKenny\'s Prinplup faces off against Pikachu. Pikachu attacks first with Thunderbolt, but Prinplup uses {{m|Metal Claw}} to block the attack, sending it back with appeal. Prinplup charges with {{m|Drill Peck}}, flying up and coming down. Pikachu uses the spin dodge method and lands an {{m|Iron Tail}}. Prinplup uses {{m|Bubble Beam}} to dampen the fall. [[James]] and {{MTR}} take note of Prinplup and decide to grab it. {{TP|Jessie|Seviper}} uses {{m|Haze}} to cover the field, disrupting the battle.\n\nAsh quickly sends out {{AP|Staravia}} to blow the haze away, just as {{TRT}} wraps Prinplup. Kenny tries to save Prinplup, but {{TP|James|Cacnea}} and {{TP|James|Carnivine}} knock them aside. Cacnea, Carnivine, and Seviper attack the group, but Piplup jumps up and uses {{m|Whirlpool}} to absorb the blitz attack. Piplup launches the attack towards Team Rocket, restoring Prinplup\'s energy and allowing it to free itself. Piplup and Prinplup set aside the rivalry and both send Team Rocket flying with Bubble Beam.\n\nThe Floaroma Contest starts up the next day. Backstage, Kenny and Dawn are preparing. Dawn embarrasses Kenny due to the fact she is wearing a dress. Dawn goes first on the [[Appeal|Performance Stage]], and she sends out Pachirisu. Although it appears in a graceful manner, it trips on its tail and crashes into the [[Contest Judge]]s\' desk. It begins to panic and run around frightened. Dawn suddenly gets an idea on how to fix the problem.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{an|Dawn}} meets up with {{si|Kenny}}, her childhood friend and newest [[rival]].\n* {{Ash}} and {{an|Brock}} meet Kenny for the first time.\n* Ash has a battle with Kenny, which gets interrupted by {{TRT}}.\n* [[Dawn\'s Piplup]] learns {{m|Whirlpool}}.\n* Dawn, Kenny, and [[Jessie|Jessilina]] enter the [[Floaroma Town]] [[Pokémon Contest]].\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* {{si|Kenny}}\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* [[Kenny\'s Prinplup]]\n* {{p|Kricketune}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* [[Zoey]] (flashback)\n* {{si|Kenny}}\n* [[Marian]]\n* [[Raoul Contesta]]\n* [[Mr. Sukizo]]\n* {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s\n* Audience\n* Children (flashback)\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Piplup}} ({{OP|Dawn|Piplup}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Mime Jr.}} ({{OP|James|Mime Jr.}})\n* {{p|Staravia}} ({{OP|Ash|Staravia}})\n* {{p|Buneary}} ({{OP|Dawn|Buneary}})\n* {{p|Pachirisu}} ({{OP|Dawn|Pachirisu}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Dustox}} ({{OP|Jessie|Dustox}})\n* {{p|Cacnea}} ({{OP|James|Cacnea}})\n* {{p|Carnivine}} ({{OP|James|Carnivine}})\n* {{p|Glameow}} ({{OP|Zoey|Glameow}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Prinplup}} ({{OP|Kenny|Prinplup}})\n* {{p|Smeargle}} (nail salon\'s)\n* {{p|Clefairy}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Magneton}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Rapidash}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Koffing}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Chansey}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Beautifly}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Sealeo}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Bidoof}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Kricketune}} (Coordinator\'s; debut)\n\n==Trivia==\n* Music from \'\'[[M08|Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]\'\' and the instrumental version of [[By Your Side ~Hikari\'s Theme~]] are used as background music.\n* [[Professor Oak\'s Big Pokémon Encyclopedia]]: [[James\'s Mime Jr.]]\n** Pokémon senryū: かわいいね\u3000マネネまねする\u3000きみのマネ \'\'Kawaii ne, Manene manesuru, kimi no mane.\'\' "Isn\'t it cute? {{tt|Manene|Mime Jr.}} imitates, your imitation."\n* {{an|Dawn}} reads the title card.\n* This is one of the rare instances when one of {{TRT}}\'s members doesn\'t blast off; only [[James]] and {{MTR}} blast off.\n** Also, none of them recite their {{motto}} in any form.
