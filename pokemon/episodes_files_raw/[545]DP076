Tag Battle for a Full Course!!\'\') is the 76th episode of the {{series|Diamond & Pearl}}, and the 542nd episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on April 24, 2008 and in the United States on September 13, 2008.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/11_22-a-full-course-tag-battle/-->\n<i>May has arrived at Lake Valor to see her old friends and compete in the Wallace Cup. She\'s brought presents for everyone and a new Pokémon, Glaceon—it\'s the new Evolution of her trusty Eevee, which she evolved in Snowpoint City. Always one for a good meal, May has lunch reservations for everyone at the Seven Stars Restaurant, a popular eatery where diners have to defeat the owner and his fiancé, Charleton and Charlene, before they can sit down to their meal. Ash and Brock partner up for the first tag battle, and easily defeat Charleton\'s Snorlax and Charlene\'s Munchlax with Pikachu and Sudowoodo.\n\nMay and Dawn are up next, and they\'re determined not to let the boys outdo them. Dawn chooses Piplup and May chooses Blaziken, while Charleton picks Girafarig and Charlene sends out her Drifloon. Before their battle can get into gear, there\'s horrible news: someone has just stolen all the food from the restaurant! The thought of no food has May seeing red, and she promptly orders Munchlax to sniff out the offenders. Munchlax leads everyone straight to Team Rocket, who are indeed gulping down all the gourmet fare. May and Dawn decide they\'ll have their tag battle after all by beating Team Rocket; a combination of Glaceon and Buneary puts Team Rocket on ice, while also earning May and Dawn their lunch ticket.\n\nSince it\'ll take time for lunch to be prepared, May and Dawn decide they\'ll still have a tag battle with Charleton and Charlene, just for fun. Girafarig and Drifloon are hardly pushovers, but they\'re no match for Piplup and Blaziken\'s fusion combination of fire and ice. With the battle over, it\'s finally time to eat. Then, May gets caught up on the latest news as she and her friends prepare for the Wallace Cup, which promises to be a big event for everyone!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{cleanup|section}}\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} are waiting at Port Valor on the [[Valor Lakefront]]. {{an|Dawn}} excitedly tells {{TP|Dawn|Piplup}} that they will get to meet {{an|May}}. Just then a {{TP|May|Beautifly}} flies across the lake towards them. Dawn scans it with her [[Pokédex]], and the Beautifly lands on Ash\'s head. Ash wonders if he knows this Beautifly as a ferry comes towards them with May waving from the bow. After greeting each other on the pier, May gives Ash a wooden {{p|Teddiursa}} and {{an|Brock}} a wooden {{p|Ursaring}}. She then gives Dawn a present, which turns out to be a {{p|Piplup}} necklace. {{TRT}} are spying on the group, and grumpily note the arrival of the "[[Hoenn]] [[twerp]]ette". Their stomachs then rumble and they complain about being broke.\n\nThe group is walking up some stairs and Ash asks about [[Max]]. May tells her friends that he is back at the [[Petalburg Gym]], taking care of [[Norman|their father\'s]] Pokémon, just like Brock showed him, making Norman very proud. Dawn then asks how long May has been in [[Sinnoh]], and May replies that she has been there for three days, as she wanted to do something in [[Snowpoint City]] first. She then sends out her newly evolved {{TP|May|Glaceon}} and after Dawn checks it on her Pokédex May explains that there is an ice cave {{rt|217|Sinnoh|near Snowpoint City}}, where an [[Ice Rock|ice crystal]] makes {{p|Eevee}} evolve. She says that it would be fun to return to [[Johto]] with a newly evolved Pokémon. She then shows Dawn her three [[Ribbon]]s, but not before saying that she can\'t beat either [[Drew]] or [[Harley]] at the moment.\n\nMay then tells Dawn that Ash told her all about her, including her two recent losses in the [[Appeal|Performance Stage]] of [[Pokémon Contest]]s, however May explains that her Johto Contest Campaign isn\'t going very well either, so the [[Wallace Cup]] should be both of their comeback Contests. Ash\'s stomach then rumbles, and May reveals that she has made reservations at [[Seven Stars Restaurant]], the most popular restaurant in Valor Lakefront.\n\nThe group enter the restaurant and are greeted by the Maitre d\'. He leads them to the next set of doors, but a young man bursts out of them and says that he will go and train, and that he will eat there if it is the last thing he does, before running off. The Maitre d\' then leads them through the doors to a battlefield and explains that only those who beat the proprietor and his fiancée are allowed to eat at the restaurant.\n\nMeanwhile, Team Rocket are looking into the restaurant through a window at the back, wishing they could get in. {{MTR}} reminds them that they are the "bad guys", and so don\'t earn their meals, they steal them.\n\n[[Roman]] and [[Kylie]] then introduce themselves, and the Maitre d\' suggests that the group should battle two at a time and have [[Multi Battle|Tag Battles]]. May and Dawn decide to pair up, and so Brock and Ash get ready to battle first. Brock sends out {{TP|Brock|Sudowoodo}} while Ash sends in {{AP|Pikachu}}; Roman sends out {{p|Snorlax}} and Kylie sends out {{p|Munchlax}}. Dawn scans them both on her Pokédex.\n\nRoman suggests that they all launch their moves at the same time, and Ash and Brock agree. The judge then starts the battle. Snorlax uses {{m|Mega Punch}}, Munchlax uses {{m|Giga Impact}}, Sudowoodo uses {{m|Double-Edge}} and Pikachu uses {{m|Volt Tackle}}. Double-Edge breaks through Giga Impact, and Pikachu dodges Mega Punch before hitting with Volt Tackle. Both Snorlax and Munchlax are knocked out. Ash and Brock express their surprise.\n\nRoman says that the winners may proceed to the restaurant and place orders, but Ash says that it is all of them or none of them. Roman sends out {{p|Girafarig}} and Kylie sends out {{p|Drifloon}}. May comments on how cute Drifloon is. Dawn then sends in Piplup, and May sends out {{TP|May|Blaziken}} which is looking stronger than ever, which Dawn checks on her Pokédex.\n\nJust as the judge is about to start the battle there is a loud crash and the waiter runs in from the restaurant saying that all the food has been stolen. Everyone is shocked, and May\'s eyes grow red and she is surrounded by fire, commenting that whoever did it won\'t get away with it. This causes Dawn to comment that she thinks May has turned into a {{type|Fire}}, and Brock to comment that one thing that will drive May over the edge is someone stealing her food. Dawn and Piplup wonder what happened to their "Princess".\n\nThe whole dining area looks like a bomb-site, and the Chef reports that every morsel of food has been stolen. Roman starts to despair, but May sends out her {{TP|May|Munchlax}}. Pikachu runs up to greet it and May suggests that Kylie send out hers too. Both Munchlax dash about the restaurant to pick up the scent of the food, and May\'s then runs off happily. Kylie\'s is still running back and forth across the room, which makes her comment that May\'s Munchlax\'s sense of smell must be better. Brock suggests that it is its "sense of stuffing its face", which May objects to. Munchlax then runs off outside. The group give chase, and May tells Kylie and Roman to leave it to them.\n\nMeanwhile, Team Rocket are stuffing their faces. Munchlax, and the group, discover them, so they finish the food off before any of them can react. They then perform their motto.\n\nMay is amazed by the new motto, but when Brock points out a fridge nearby, she gets angry again. Brock and Ash are about to intervene, but May and Dawn stop them, reminding them that it is their turn; May sends out Glaceon and Dawn sends out {{TP|Dawn|Buneary}}. {{TP|James|Carnivine}} uses {{m|Bullet Seed}} and Seviper uses {{m|Poison Tail}}, but both are countered with a double {{m|Ice Beam}}, pushing them back into Team Rocket and freezing them all. Glaceon then uses {{m|Iron Tail}} to lift them into the air, and Buneary uses {{m|Bounce}} to send them blasting off. Buneary then starts fawning over Pikachu, which May notices, causing Dawn to comment that Buneary is a big fan of Pikachu.\n\nBack at the restaurant, Roman thanks them. Ash says that May and Dawn did it, and Dawn says it was really the Pokémon. May, however, says that everybody deserves the credit. Kylie then tells them that she and Roman decided to let them eat without having a battle, but the chef tells them that it will take some time to prepare the food, as it must be made fresh. May and Dawn then decide to have their Tag Battle while they\'re waiting.\n\nGirafarig and Drifloon face off against Piplup and Blaziken. Girafarig uses {{m|Bite}}, Drifloon uses {{m|Constrict}}, Blaziken uses {{m|Blaze Kick}} and Piplup uses {{m|Bubble Beam}}. Drifloon spins to bat away the Bubble Beam and grabs Piplup with Constrict while Girafarig dodges Blaze Kick before hitting Blaziken with Bite. Kylie says that it isn\'t easy to escape her Drifloon\'s Constrict, so Dawn tells Piplup to use {{m|Whirlpool}}. Both Drifloon and Girafarig are caught in the Whirlpool and pushed up towards the ceiling.\n\nMay tells Dawn to get Piplup to use Bubble Beam, and when it hits she tells Blaziken to jump above them and use {{m|Fire Spin}}. The two attacks meet with Girafarig and Drifloon in the middle, creating the fusion of fire and water and sending out blue and orange sparks. The force of the attacks causes a small explosion and Blaziken lands behind Piplup. When the smoke clears, both Girafarig and Drifloon are unable to battle. May and Dawn celebrate with high fives and Blaziken stands up with Piplup standing on its arm. Everyone compliments the battlers and then the Maitre d\' announces that lunch is ready.\n\nThat evening the group are standing on a balcony overlooking [[Lake Valor]]. May asks Ash if he still has his half of the {{to|Terracotta}} [[Ribbon]], and both hold their halves up. May tells the group that it has become her lucky charm, causing Dawn to show the group the Ribbon that [[Johanna|her mother]] gave her, which is her lucky charm. Ash then reveals to May that [[Wallace]] suggested he enter the Wallace Cup with {{AP|Buizel}}, shocking May. And so Ash, May and Dawn all prepare to enter the Wallace Cup, all determined to win.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:May DP series.png|thumb|220px|May making her return]]\n* {{an|May}} arrives at [[Lake Valor]] for the [[Wallace Cup]].\n* {{an|Dawn}} and May meet for the first time.\n* May\'s {{p|Eevee}} is revealed to have [[Evolution|evolved]] into a {{TP|May|Glaceon}} while in [[Snowpoint City]], and to have learned {{m|Ice Beam}} and {{m|Iron Tail}}.\n* It is revealed in a flashback that [[Drew]]\'s {{p|Roselia}} has evolved into a {{TP|Drew|Roserade}}.\n* May is revealed to have won three [[Johto]] [[Ribbon]]s.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Glaceon}} ({{OP|May|Glaceon}})\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]] (flashback)\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Drew]] (flashback)\n* [[Harley]] (flashback)\n* [[Norman]] (flashback)\n* [[Caroline]] (flashback)\n* [[Roman]]\n* [[Kylie]]\n* Maitre d\'\n* [[Battle judge]]\n* Chef\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Piplup}} ({{OP|Dawn|Piplup}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Blaziken}} ({{OP|May|Blaziken}})\n* {{p|Beautifly}} ({{OP|May|Beautifly}})\n* {{p|Munchlax}} ({{OP|May|Munchlax}})\n* {{p|Glaceon}} ({{OP|May|Glaceon}}; debut)\n* {{p|Buneary}} ({{OP|Dawn|Buneary}})\n* {{p|Sudowoodo}} ({{OP|Brock|Sudowoodo}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Carnivine}} ({{OP|James|Carnivine}})\n* {{p|Slaking}} ({{OP|Norman|Slaking}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Roserade}} ({{OP|Drew|Roserade}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Wigglytuff}} ([[Harley]]\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Snorlax}} ([[Roman]]\'s)\n* {{p|Girafarig}} ([[Roman]]\'s)\n* {{p|Drifloon}} ([[Kylie]]\'s)\n* {{p|Munchlax}} ([[Kylie]]\'s)\n\n==Trivia==\n* Much like {{an|Misty}}\'s guest appearance in \'\'[[AG044|The Princess and the Togepi]]\'\' and \'\'[[AG045|A Togepi Mirage]]\'\', {{an|May}} makes a temporary return.\n* An instrumental version of [[I Won\'t Lose! ~Haruka\'s Theme~]] is used during the battle with {{TRT}}. [[Pokémon Symphonic Medley]] is also used as background music.\n** On another note, I Won\'t Lose! ~Haruka\'s Theme~ was left in the dub as the background music for the first time.\n* [[Roman]] and [[Kylie]] are based on the {{tc|Rich Boy}} and {{tc|Lady}} of the same names, both of whom can be battled in the [[Seven Stars Restaurant]] in {{game2|Diamond|Pearl|Platinum}}.\n* Instead of [[Professor Oak\'s Big Pokémon Encyclopedia]], the end of the episode featured a memorial to \'\'[[M02|The Power of One]]\'\' called [[Pikachu the Movie Memorial]]. This is part of a countdown to \'\'[[M11|Giratina and the Sky Warrior]]\'\'.\n* The dub title is the first dub title since \'\'[[AG171|Pokémon Ranger - Deoxys\' Crisis! (Part 1)]]\'\' to simply be a translation of the Japanese title, although without the mention of the Seven Stars Restaurant.\n* {{Ash}} makes a reference to \'\'[[AG153|Tactics Theatrics!!]]\'\' in this episode.<!-- Specifically what reference? -->\n* This episode aired in the U.S. on the same day that {{game|Platinum}} was released in Japan.\n* [[Ted Lewis]] returns to the series in this episode under the pseudonym of \'\'\'Ed Paul\'\'\', having been laid off with every other voice actor except for [[Carter Cathcart|Jimmy Zoppi]] and [[Kayzie Rogers]] after [[S08|the eighth season of Pokémon]]. This makes him the third of the main cast to return to the series, the first two being [[Rachael Lillis]] and [[Maddie Blaustein]]. Lewis was part of the main cast on two occasions: first voicing [[James]] from \'\'[[EP002|Pokémon Emergency!]]\'\' to \'\'[[EP008|The Path to the Pokémon League]]\'\' and {{Tracey}} during the [[Orange Archipelago|Orange Islands]] arc.\n* In this episode, Team Rocket uses a variation of their {{motto}}.\n* This is the only episode of the [[Wallace Cup]] arc in which [[Wallace]] does not appear.\n* The wood carvings that May gives to Ash and {{an|Brock}} are a reference to a popular souvenir in {{wp|Hokkaido}} (the area of Japan that [[Sinnoh]] is based on), which are wooden carvings in the form of bears fishing or hunting, since they are the most abundant animals there.\n\n===Errors===\n* In one scene, {{p|Drifloon}} was colored pink, instead of purple. This scene was changed to purple in the dub and the subsequent Japanese airings.\n* In two scenes, one of May\'s gloves is colored black, like Ash\'s gloves.\n* While Kylie\'s Munchlax used {{m|Giga Impact}} in this episode, it [[Anime move errors|can\'t learn it in the games]].\n** Also, Roman\'s Girafarig used {{m|Bite}}, which it cannot learn in the games, either.\n* The [[Pokédex]] accidentally says that {{p|Snorlax}} can eat {{tt|400 pounds|\u202a181.4369 kilograms\u202c}} of food instead of {{tt|900|\u202a408.2331 kilograms}}.\n** In the original Japanese version, the Pokédex states that Snorlax can eat {{tt|400 \'\'kilograms\'\'|\u202a881.849 pounds}} of food.\n\n<gallery>\nDP076 error.png|May\'s black glove error\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FCC|bordercolor=99F\n|zh_cmn={{tt|七星級七星飯店！靠雙打對戰吃到全餐！！|Seven Stars Restaurant!
