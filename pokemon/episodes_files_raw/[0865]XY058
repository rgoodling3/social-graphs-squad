It first aired in Japan on January 29, 2015 and in the United States on April 11, 2015.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/18_10-the-green-green-grass-types-of-home/-->\n<i>It’s time for Ash’s Coumarine City Gym battle with Ramos, and our hero can’t wait to get started! But Ramos is in no hurry at all. He invites our heroes to tea, and then asks them for some help tending his garden.\n\nEventually, it’s time for the big battle to begin. When Ash’s Fletchinder takes down Jumpluff, he thinks he has a big advantage at this Grass-type Gym! But Ramos’s Weepinbell unleashes a Poison Powder that quickly defeats Fletchinder and then Hawlucha.\n\nFinally, Ash sends out the Water-type Frogadier, which seems like a bad type matchup. But it turns out Ash has a plan—he instructs Frogadier to use its Frubbles as a protective mask so it doesn’t inhale the powder! The plan works, and Weepinbell is soon defeated.\n\nRamos sends out his trusty Gogoat, who uses Razor Leaf as an evasion tactic in a way Ash has never seen before. Inspired, Ash has Frogadier first use Double Team, and then prepare a Water Pulse while Gogoat is distracted. It works, and Ash wins the Plant Badge!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{an|Serena}} dreams about being in her first [[Pokémon Showcase]] with {{TP|Serena|Fennekin}}. As she trips and falls in her dream, she also falls out of her bed and wakes up to find that {{Ash}} is not there. She heads outside to find Ash taking a morning jog with {{AP|Pikachu}} and thinks about how hard he has been working, resolving to work just as hard herself. \n\nAsh and {{ashfr}} go to the [[Coumarine Gym]], an enormous tree, and climb it all the way to the top, to where the battlefield is. After he is greeted by [[Ramos]], Ash requests a Gym battle right away, but Ramos instead brings them all inside for a tea break. He then requests that they help him with his gardening. Because Ash is frustrated at not being given a Gym battle right away, he is pulling out the weeds quite violently and Ramos shows him two sprouts underneath the weeds. He then explains to Ash that if a person only looks at what is in front of them, then they will lose sight of what is important, just like Ash was doing with the weeds and the sprouts. After imparting this wisdom to Ash, Ramos agrees to give him a Gym battle.\n[[File:XY058 Ash VS Ramos.png|thumb|left|250px|Ash facing Ramos]]\nLeaving {{AP|Goomy}} under {{an|Bonnie}}\'s care, Ash begins his Gym battle against Ramos by using {{AP|Fletchinder}} to counter Ramos\'s {{p|Jumpluff}}. Fletchinder\'s first {{m|Flame Charge}} is unsuccessful due to Jumpluff\'s {{m|Cotton Guard}}, and Jumpluff takes the initiative to use {{m|Sunny Day}}. Due to its [[Ability]] being {{a|Chlorophyll}}, Jumpluff\'s {{stat|Speed}} dramatically increases, but Ash responds by having Fletchinder use repeated Flame Charges to raise its Speed as well. Eventually, despite a second Cotton Guard from Jumpluff, Fletchinder lands a hit and knocks Jumpluff out. Ramos next sends out his {{p|Weepinbell}}. Although Fletchinder tries the same strategy again, Weepinbell, who also has Chlorophyll for an Ability, dodges them and poisons Fletchinder with {{m|Poison Powder}}. It then uses {{m|Slam}} to remove Fletchinder from the battle.\n\nWith both sides now down to two Pokémon, Ash chooses {{AP|Hawlucha}} to battle Weepinbell. Hawlucha starts off with {{m|Flying Press}} and scores a direct hit against Weepinbell, but its {{m|High Jump Kick}} is dodged and Hawlucha is poisoned just the same way that Fletchinder was. With the poison slowing Hawlucha down, Hawlucha falls victim to a {{m|Razor Leaf}}, {{m|Slam}}, and {{m|Grass Knot}}. After landing a High Jump Kick, Hawlucha is defeated by Weepinbell\'s Slam. As his final Pokémon, Ash chooses {{AP|Frogadier}}. After {{m|Water Pulse}} is dodged by Weepinbell, Frogadier uses {{m|Double Team}}. However, Weepinbell correctly senses which Frogadier is the real one and hits it with Grass Knot. Frogadier then counters Poison Powder by using its frubbles as a gas mask and uses {{m|Aerial Ace}} to break through the Grass Knot and finally defeat Weepinbell.\n\nRamos sends out his {{p|Gogoat}} as his last Pokémon. After Frogadier\'s Water Pulse collides with Gogoat\'s {{m|Vine Whip}}, Ash tries Double Team again, but Gogoat uses Vine Whip to take them all out and deals damage to Frogadier. Ramos pats Gogoat on the horn, understanding that they are both having fun with this battle. Gogoat uses Razor Leaf to distract Frogadier before coming in with another Razor Leaf from above. Ash then employs the same strategy against Gogoat, by first using Double Team to distract Gogoat and then attacking with Aerial Ace. However, Gogoat responds with a {{m|Horn Leech}} attack, healing itself as well as inflicting even more damage on Frogadier. Gogoat then uses {{m|Leech Seed}} on Frogadier, draining a lot of its energy. Ramos tells Ash that Gogoat can use Leech Seed so well because Gogoat and Ramos trust each other completely. Ash knows that he believes in his Pokémon, too, but he begins to succumb to the pressure and loses hope of winning the battle. However, Pikachu provides some much-needed encouragement and Ash realizes that they can still win. Gogoat and Ramos are getting even more excited about the battle and Gogoat uses Razor Leaf to surround Frogadier. While Frogadier is desperately fending off the Razor Leaf attacks, Ash remembers Ramos\'s advice from before and instructs Frogadier to ignore the Razor Leaf and find Gogoat, which Frogadier does and lands a perfect Aerial Ace. Using a combination of Double Team and Water Pulse, Frogadier defeats Gogoat and wins Ash the battle.\n\nRamos gives Ash his {{badge|Plant}}, which Ash happily accepts, and Ash reminds Serena that it is now her turn to participate in her first Pokémon Showcase. Serena is very excited and can\'t wait for her performance.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:Ash Plant Badge.png|thumb|220px|Ash holding the Plant Badge]]\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

However, Hawlucha only has {{m|Flying Press|one such move}}.\n** Furthermore, he says it as if it applies to Weepinbell, although it doesn\'t, since Weepinbell\'s secondary type is {{t|Poison}}, which renders Flying Press regularly effective.\n* Just before Ash is given his {{badge|Plant}}, {{an|Bonnie}} is shown holding {{AP|Goomy}}; however, after being given the Badge, Goomy is nowhere to be seen.\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=F16A81|bordercolor=025DA6\n|zh_yue={{tt|海翼道館戰！呱頭蛙對指路羊！！|Coumarine Gym Battle!
