It first aired in Japan on July 7, 2011, and in the United States on October 29, 2011.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/14_39-reunion-battles-in-nimbasa/-->\n<i>Our heroes think they’ve finally arrived in Nimbasa City, but their new friend Luke informs them that they’re actually in Nimbasa Town, home of the Pokémon Club Battle Tournament. Named after Don George’s Pokémon Battle Club, which sponsors the event, the tournament promises to be filled with excitement. One by one, many of our heroes’ friends and rivals show up to register: Bianca, Georgia, Burgundy, Stephan, and Trip are all in town for the competition!\n\nSoon the matchups are announced and the action gets under way. Iris’s rival, “Dragon Buster” Georgia, is up first, and her Beartic quickly takes down her opponent’s Joltik. Later, Ash faces off against Burgundy, Cilan’s old rival and fellow Pokémon Connoisseur! Confident as ever, Burgundy chides Ash for not completely replacing his Pokémon team as she recommended during their last meeting, but our hero and his Palpitoad manage to defeat Burgundy and her Stoutland!\n\nNext up, Cilan is set to battle Trip. Meanwhile, the Team Rocket trio have quietly arrived in Nimbasa City, confidently preparing for their next assignment...</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{TRT}} arrives in [[Nimbasa City]], ready to begin planning their latest scheme, one which is far more ambitious than all their previous ones. Meanwhile, {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrive at what they think is Nimbasa City, but [[Luke]] informs them that they are actually in [[Nimbasa Town]], the site of a Pokémon battle tournament. As Ash prepares to head over to the tournament, {{an|Bianca}} arrives and explains that she is competing in the tournament as well.\n\nAs the group approaches the stadium, Luke begins filming his documentary of the tournament, but Bianca interrupts him and takes an immediate liking to his {{p|Zorua}}, asking to trade her {{p|Pignite}} for it, to which Luke refuses. The group then receives registration forms from [[Don George]], and, while filling them out, they discover that [[Burgundy]] is also entering. After Burgundy reiterates her hatred of {{an|Cilan}}, [[Stephan]] arrives to join the party as well, with his newly evolved {{p|Zebstrika}}. [[Georgia]] arrives as well, wasting no time in trading insults with {{an|Iris}}, whereupon Ash notices [[Trip]]\'s presence at the front of the stadium. \n\nThe tournament soon begins, with Don George introducing the grand prize: a seven-feather [[wing]] set to improve a Pokémon\'s [[base power|Effort values]]. When the first round matchups are announced, Ash finds himself facing Burguny, Cilan\'s opponent is Trip, and Iris is matched against a man called [[Jimmy Ray]]. \n\nGeorgia wins her battle against {{OBP|Sylvester|BW039|her opponent}} relatively quickly, and the tournament proceeds through the next two battles until it is time for Ash to face off against Burgundy. After Burgundy calls out {{p|Stoutland}}, Ash brings out his {{AP|Palpitoad}} - which is Palpitoad\'s first Pokémon battle. Palpitoad opens with {{m|Mud Shot}}, to which Stoutland counters with {{m|Tackle}}. After Stoutland then tries an {{t|Ground|ineffective}} {{m|Thunder Fang}} on Palpitoad, it then returns with an {{m|Ice Fang}} instead. However, before Palpitoad is completely frozen, Ash commands it to use {{m|Supersonic}}, which causes Stoutland to let go and also shatters the ice. After a fierce barrage of attacks from both sides, Palpitoad emerges victorious, allowing Ash to proceed to the second round.\n\nAfter Zorua pulls more of her pranks by mimicking Georgia, Cilan and Trip prepare for their battle, with Cilan promising to have his performance be even better than Ash\'s.\n\n==Major events==\n* The [[Team Rocket trio]] arrives in [[Nimbasa City]].\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} enter the [[Club Battle]], along with [[Luke]], {{an|Bianca}}, [[Burgundy]], [[Georgia]], [[Stephan]], and [[Trip]].\n* Stephan\'s {{p|Blitzle}} is revealed to have evolved into a {{p|Zebstrika}}.\n* Georgia defeats {{OBP|Sylvester|BW039}} and advances to the second round.\n* Burgundy is revealed to have obtained a {{p|Stoutland}}.\n* Ash defeats Burgundy and advances to the second round.\n* Trip starts his battle with {{an|Cilan}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* [[Freddy O\'Martian]]\n* [[Antonio]]\n* [[Emmanuel]]\n* [[Dino]]\n* [[Scooter]]\n* [[Jimmy Ray]]\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Stoutland}}\n* {{p|Zebstrika}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Iris}}\n* {{an|Cilan}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Trip]]\n* {{an|Bianca}}\n* [[Burgundy]]\n* [[Stephan]]\n* [[Georgia]]\n* [[Luke]]\n* [[Don George]]\n* [[Freddy O\'Martian]]\n* [[Antonio]]\n* [[Emmanuel]]\n* {{OBP|Omega|BW039}}\n* [[Dino]]\n* {{OBP|Sylvester|BW039}}\n* [[Scooter]]\n* [[Jimmy Ray]]\n* Don George\'s pupil\n* {{pkmn|Trainer}}s\n* Audience\n* Citizens\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP BW039.png|200px|thumb|right|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Zebstrika}}\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Axew}} ({{OP|Iris|Axew}})\n* {{p|Oshawott}} ({{OP|Ash|Oshawott}}; flashback) \n* {{p|Palpitoad}} ({{OP|Ash|Palpitoad}})\n* {{p|Stoutland}} ([[Burgundy]]\'s; debut)\n* {{p|Dewott}} ([[Burgundy]]\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Sawsbuck}} ([[Burgundy]]\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Zebstrika}} ([[Stephan]]\'s; debut)\n* {{p|Beartic}} ({{OP|Georgia|Beartic}})\n* {{p|Zorua}} ({{OP|Luke|Zorua}})\n* {{p|Golett}} ([[Luke]]\'s)\n* {{p|Deerling}} ([[Dino]]\'s)\n* {{p|Patrat}} ({{OBP|Omega|BW039}}\'s)\n* {{p|Joltik}} ({{OBP|Sylvester|BW039}}\'s)\n* {{p|Scolipede}} ([[Emmanuel]]\'s)\n* {{p|Tranquill}} ([[Antonio]]\'s)\n* {{p|Deerling}}\n* {{p|Pidove}} (×2)\n* {{p|Patrat}}\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:BW039 error.png|thumb|200px|right|The error with Luke\'s eyes]]\n* [[Professor Oak\'s Pokémon Live Caster]]: {{p|Cottonee}}\n* This episode begins the four-part [[Club Battle]] arc.\n* There is no [[Professor Oak\'s Pokémon Live Caster]] following this episode.
