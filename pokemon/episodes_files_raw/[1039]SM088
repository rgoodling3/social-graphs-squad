It first aired in Japan on August 30, 2018, in New Zealand on December 15, 2018, in the United Kingdom on January 4, 2019, in Canada on January 5, 2019, and in the United States on January 26, 2019.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/21_44-full-moon-and-many-arms/-->\n<i>The Ultra Guardians spring into action to protect Lunala from the mysterious creature who has chased it through the Ultra Wormhole! UB Black (as Lusamine later calls it) drains the power from Lunala’s Ultra Aura, then fastens itself onto the Legendary Pokémon to absorb it! Our heroes manage to fight it off with the help of Solgaleo, but the creature turns a similar attack on Solgaleo, absorbing it and escaping through an Ultra Wormhole.\n\nAs Lunala recovers its strength, the Ultra Guardians promise to do everything they can to rescue Solgaleo—and the kahunas prepare for a festival celebrating a solar eclipse!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{DL|Light trio (anime)|Necrozma}} fully emerges from the [[Ultra Wormhole]] and pursues {{DL|Light trio (anime)|Lunala}} as the [[Ultra Guardians]] and the [[Aether Foundation]] staff watch on. After seeing Necrozma drain Lunala of its Ultra Aura, [[Professor Burnet]] realizes that Necrozma is responsible for absorbing Alola\'s Ultra Aura. {{an|Kiawe}} sees that Lunala and Necrozma are headed towards [[Melemele Island]]. At {{an|Lusamine}}\'s command, the Ultra Guardians mount their [[Poké Ride|Ride Pokémon]] and fly after Lunala and Necrozma.\n\nMeanwhile, at {{TRT}}\'s food truck, {{MTR}} spots Lunala and Necrozma flying around and tries to get [[Jessie]] and [[James]] to look, but they aren\'t motivated to do so. Meanwhile, aboard the [[Team Rocket]] helicopter, [[Matori]] and [[Gozu]] are becoming lax from the Ultra Aura depletion. Meowth calls them, and Matori demands to know what is happening. After Meowth tells Matori that Lunala and Necrozma appeared above Melemele, she has Gozu set course for Melemele Island. Jessie asks if they are going to catch it, and Matori clarifies that she and her Matori Matrix unit will before cutting the transmission. Jessie rants about Matori\'s attitude and vanity before returning to her exhausted state. Meowth becomes worried that if Matori succeeds, she will get a promotion and be able to boss them around even more, but his attempt to use this to motivate his teammates fails.\n\n[[Hala]] and his {{p|Hariyama}} grow concerned as Lunala and Necrozma appear above a Melemele beach. Lunala is able to get away thanks to {{DL|Guardian deities (anime)|Tapu Koko}} who blocks Necrozma’s path. Despite being hit by a {{m|Dazzling Gleam}}, Necrozma continues to pursue Lunala. The Ultra Guardians arrive on the scene as Necrozma launches a {{m|Psycho Cut}}, but Lunala dodges and retaliates with {{m|Moongeist Beam}}. Necrozma isn\'t fazed and hits Lunala with another Psycho Cut. Lunala fights back with {{m|Moonblast}} and {{m|Air Slash}}, then uses {{m|Phantom Force}} to ambush Necrozma. Lunala attempts another Phantom Force, but Necrozma attacks with {{m|Metal Claw}}, which Lunala dodges, only to be hit by another  Psycho Cut, sending it into the ocean. {{Ash}} and {{an|Gladion}} have their {{p|Garchomp}} and {{p|Noivern}} use {{m|Dragon Pulse}} and {{m|Boomburst}} on Necrozma. The interventions only angers Necrozma who unleashes {{m|Prismatic Laser}} on the Ultra Guardians, causing {{an|Lillie}} to fall off {{p|Altaria}}. Lunala swoops in and saves Lillie. Kiawe, {{an|Mallow}}, {{an|Sophocles}}, and {{an|Lana}} have {{TP|Kiawe|Charizard}}, {{p|Flygon}}, {{p|Metang}}, and {{p|Dragonair}} use {{m|Flamethrower}}, {{m|Fire Blast}}, {{m|Flash Cannon}}, and {{m|Ice Beam}} respectively on Necrozma, but it is still unfazed and attacks with more Prismatic Laser, forcing the Ultra Guardians to retreat. However, {{AP|Poipole}} is fixated by Necrozma and {{Rotom}} soon realizes that Necrozma\'s back features the same Prism Star symbol that Poipole [[SM087|drew before]], meaning that Necrozma may be connected to the "Blinding One". Necrozma grabs onto Lunala and starts absorbing its Ultra Aura. Rotom also notes that Necrozma might be trying to possess Lunala itself. Gladion Noivern use another Boomburst and a {{m|Bite}} attack, but Necrozma shakes them off which causes Gladion to fall off of Noivern. While Ash catches Gladion, Necrozma splits itself up and merges with Lunala, becoming {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Necrozma|Dawn Wings Necrozma}}.\n\nSoon after, Matori Matrix\'s helicopter ensnares Dawn Wings Necrozma in an electromagnetic net, but it breaks free. Another Ultra Wormhole opens up and {{DL|Light trio (anime)|Solgaleo|Nebby}} emerges from it. Ash is happy to see Nebby again and hugs it. Nebby turns its attention to Dawn Wings Necrozma and attacks it, but Dawn Wings Necrozma counters with Prismatic Laser. Then, Nebby hits Dawn Wings Necrozma with {{m|Sunsteel Strike}}, which causes Necrozma to separate from Lunala and fall into the sea. Ash cheers at Nebby\'s win, but the weakened Lunala falls onto the beach. Nebby rushes to Lunala\'s side, but it is attacked by the helicopter. Despite a female grunt\'s concerns, Gozu calls for another electromagnetic net deployed at maximum power. The electromagnetic net captures Nebby and Lunala, but Gladion and Ash have {{TP|Gladion|Silvally}} and {{AP|Pikachu}} use {{m|Air Slash}} and {{m|Thunderbolt}} on the net, freeing the pair. Nebby attacks the helicopter, forcing it to retreat. But then, Necrozma recovers and targets Nebby. It grabs onto Nebby, splits up its body, and merges the parts onto the latter\'s body, becoming Dusk Mane Necrozma. Dusk Mane Necrozma opens up and Ultra Wormhole and goes through it. Ash tries to chase after Dusk Mane Necrozma, but the Ultra Wormhole closes before he can go through.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the [[Pokémon School]], [[Professor Kukui]] and [[Samson Oak]] are sleeping, when suddenly, they are revitalized. Back at Team Rocket\'s food truck, Jessie and James also get their energy back and drive off to go find Lunala and Necrozma. On board the Matori Matrix helicopter, the crew is thinking about just giving up, when they suddenly feel normal and reactivate their aircraft\'s optical camouflage to wait for their next chance. The Aether Foundation staff arrive at the Ultra Guardians\' location, and they bring Lunala back to the Ultra Guardians base to heal. Lusamine reveals little about Necrozma and simply refers to it as UB Black. The Ultra Guardians are relieved to see that the adults are feeling better as Kukui and Samson Oak join them at the base. Burnet and Wicke return from the medical room and reveal that Lunala\'s treatment is complete, but it will need time to recover its strength.\n\nAsh remembers that the mural at the [[Altar of the Sunne]] had an image of Necrozma on it, and Lusamine states that there might be a connection between the "Blinding One" and Necrozma. Rotom asks Poipole why it drew the symbol, and Poipole attempts to explain, but no one can understand it. Then, {{an|Faba}} runs into the room with data on the helicopter from earlier, revealing that it belongs to the Matori Matrix, an elite unit of Team Rocket, angering Ash. Faba notes that they\'ll have to take the Matori Matrix into account in their counter strategy against Necrozma. Lusamine leaves the Ultra Guardians to watch Lunala as the adults go to plan the next stage of action.\n\nThe next day, at sunrise, the [[Island Kahuna]]s visit their respective ruins: Hala at the [[Ruins of Conflict]], [[Olivia]] at the [[Ruins of Life]], and [[Nanu]] with [[Acerola]] visit the [[Ruins of Abundance]]; where they pray as their islands\' respective [[Guardian deities]] watch. Back down in the Ultra Guardians base, the Ultra Guardians watch as Lunala sleeps. Just as Ash proclaims that he will help save Solgaleo, the group\'s [[Z-Ring]]s and [[Z-Power Ring]]s glow orange and the energy surrounds Lunala who soon wakes up from its recovery. The Ultra Guardians watch on as Lunala spreads its wings and shatters the medical room\'s glass.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
