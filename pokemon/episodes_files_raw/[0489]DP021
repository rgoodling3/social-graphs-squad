It first aired in Japan on March 1, 2007 and in the United States on July 10, 2007.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/tv-episodes/season-10/episode-21-10_21-ya-see-we-want-an-evolution/-->\n<i>As Team Rocket trudges through Sinnoh, they run into the Magikarp Salesman who\'s tricked them so many times before. This time, he cons them into buying an Evolution machine that will evolve a Pokémon at any time—or so he says. Elsewhere, Ash and his friends hear about the B-Button League, a group of Coordinators who never evolve their Pokémon. The rumors say they have a beautiful Feebas and a powerful Magikarp, so Ash and his friends go to check it out.\n\nThe B-Button League is headed by a girl named Haley, and she and her sister Oralie do indeed have a very fine Feebas and Magikarp. Team Rocket sneaks in to watch Dawn and Ash test their Pokémon against Oralie\'s Magikarp; not only does Magikarp defeat Piplup, it\'s strong enough to give Pikachu a run for its money! Team Rocket is so impressed, they grab Magikarp and Feebas on the spot, then take Pikachu too when it tries to stop them.\n\nNow Team Rocket prepares to use their new machine to evolve all three Pokémon, much to our heroes\' dismay. But the Evolution machine doesn\'t work at all! However, Team Rocket has a plan B: their new machine can also transform into a tough-looking robot. Too bad for them that the robot quickly falls apart, being just another sales scam. Oralie and Haley have Feebas and Magikarp help Pikachu defeat Team Rocket, and then our heroes can happily continue on their way to Floaroma Town!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAn exhausted {{TRT}} hikes along a [[route]]. A {{p|Magikarp}} lands in [[James]]\'s hands as they run into [[Magikarp salesman|a man advertising a Magikarp]]. Team Rocket recognizes him as the same salesman that [[EP015|conned them]] [[AG079|many times before]], James promptly tossing the Magikarp in his face. They try to get their [[Pokémon Dollar|money]] back, but the salesman manages to change the subject, discussing an [[evolution]]-inducing machine. He tells them about a company that developed the prototype machine, but the company went bankrupt. The workers developed the technology more so the salesman can get one. Team Rocket decides to take the plans for building the machine. Before he runs off, the salesman warns them that after they build it, they need to wait a week before using the machine.\n\nMeanwhile, {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} return to [[Jubilife City]] in order to reach [[Floaroma Town]]. While walking, a TV crew from the Jubilife Sinnoh Today Show asks Ash if he would evolve his {{AP|Pikachu}}, which his response is not without checking with Pikachu. They believe he is with the [[B-Button League]]. When {{an|Dawn}} asks about the club, the reporter explains that they are a group of {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s in Jubilife that compete without evolving their {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} and that the group has a very powerful Magikarp and {{p|Feebas}}. Ash and his friends head to the location and meet the leader [[Haley]] and her sister [[Oralie]]. {{an|Brock}}\'s usual attraction is stopped by {{TP|Brock|Croagunk}}\'s {{m|Poison Jab|jab}}.\n\nInside, they approach a pool as Haley activates a remote, raising the pool and showing their Magikarp and Feebas. While Ash and Dawn check their [[Pokédex]]es, Haley and Oralie discuss their beliefs that Pokémon can be strong without evolving, desiring to make their Magikarp and Feebas as strong as possible, similar to Ash and Pikachu. Ash asks for a {{pkmn|battle}} against Magikarp, but Dawn manages to go first, wanting to test {{TP|Dawn|Piplup}}\'s battle skill in water. A [[List of Team Rocket\'s disguises|disguised]] Team Rocket shows up as a fake C-button league. They put up a guise of wanting to research the group.\n\nPiplup jumps into the pool as Oralie\'s Magikarp prepares to duel. Piplup uses {{m|Peck}} but Magikarp dodges underwater. Both swim strong underwater, but Magikarp easily dodges Piplup\'s attack and jumps out of the water. Piplup fires {{m|Bubble Beam}} to the surface as Magikarp swats it away and dives down, {{m|Tackle|tackling}} Piplup and slamming it around the pool walls before sending it into the ceiling. It lands in the water and floats to the surface, [[fainting|knocked out]]. Though stunned at how powerful Magikarp is, Ash still wants to take his chance against Magikarp with Pikachu.\n\nPikachu fires {{m|Thunderbolt}}, but Magikarp jumps into the air and spins to dodge. It comes down with Tackle, and although Pikachu tries to dodge, Magikarp still hits, slamming Pikachu into the edge of the pool. Pikachu clings onto the edge before retaliating with {{m|Quick Attack}}. Magikarp meets it head on with Tackle, but Pikachu switches to {{m|Iron Tail}}. Both attacks hit and create an explosion, tossing both Pokémon into the pool. Pikachu gets back onto the island and Magikarp resurfaces, both exhausted.\n\nAfter the battle, Haley and Oralie offer Ash and his friends lunch. As they turn to offer the C-Button League, they spot Team Rocket stealing Magikarp and Feebas. Team Rocket removes their disguises and recites their {{motto}}. As Team Rocket flees, the group follows. Brock vows to help, but Croagunk jabs him cold, which causes Dawn to scold the Pokémon for behaving rashly. The group follows [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|Team Rocket\'s balloon]] outside as Ash sends {{AP|Staravia}} to pursue. They wind up outside the city as Staravia leads the group to a small cabin along a river.\n\nInside, they find Team Rocket with their evolution-inducing machine, preparing to put Magikarp inside. Haley and Oralie protest the evolution, which would undo their {{pkmn|training}} efforts. Ash has Pikachu attempt Thunderbolt, but Team Rocket captures Pikachu in a capsule, wanting to evolve Pikachu as well. They drop a cage on top of Ash and his friends, pinning them as they activate the machine. They try to evolve Magikarp into {{p|Gyarados}}, but Magikarp pops out unchanged. They try the process again, but it also fails. Team Rocket switches gears and tries to evolve Pikachu into {{p|Raichu}}, but it also fails. {{MTR}} realizes that the salesman\'s warning about waiting a week was accurate because otherwise the machine would fail.\n\nWhile Team Rocket argues, Ash orders Pikachu to use {{m|Iron Tail}} to break the cage. Meowth activates a switch to turn the machine into a mecha, destroying the cabin and unveiling the mecha. However, the machine implodes into dust, as it needs to execute a successful evolution. Haley and Oralie decide to exact retribution with Magikarp\'s {{m|Tackle}} and Feebas\'s {{m|Ice Beam}}, Pikachu finishing with {{m|Thunderbolt}} to blast Team Rocket off. Afterward, Ash and his friends return to the city and head off to Floaroma Town.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{TRT}} encounter the [[Magikarp salesman]] again.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Magikarp salesman]]\n* [[Haley]]\n* [[Oralie]]\n* Female reporter\n* Cameraman\n* Pokémon Professor\n* IT employee\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Piplup}} ({{OP|Dawn|Piplup}})\n* {{p|Staravia}} ({{OP|Ash|Staravia}})\n* {{p|Croagunk}} ({{OP|Brock|Croagunk}})\n* {{p|Magikarp}} ({{OP|Magikarp salesman|Magikarp}})\n* {{p|Magikarp}} ([[Oralie]]\'s)\n* {{p|Feebas}} ([[Haley]]\'s)\n* {{p|Gyarados}} (fantasy)\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:Wii Remote anime.png|thumb|200px|A [[Wii]] Remote look-alike]]\n* [[Professor Oak\'s Big Pokémon Encyclopedia]]: [[Dawn\'s Pachirisu]]\n* Pokémon senryū: パチリスが\u3000おめめさめたよ\u3000パッチリす \'\'Pachirisu ga / Omemesameta yo / Patchiri su\'\'\n* The title card is read by [[Jessie]], [[James]], and {{MTR}}, and, in the dub, sung to the tune of {{wp|The Beatles}}\' \'\'{{wp|Revolution (song)|Revolution}}\'\' (as well as the slower version of the song, \'\'{{wp|Revolution 1}}\'\'), which the episode title references. Jessie sings the title solo in the European Portuguese dub.\n* The educational magazine James subscribed to as a child, 実験と自習 \'\'Experimentation and Self-Study\'\', is a parody of the magazine 科学と学習 \'\'Science and Education\'\'.\n* Music from \'\'[[PK12|Gotta Dance!]]\'\' and the titular theme from \'\'[[M04|Celebi: The Voice of the Forest]]\'\' is used as background music.\n* The remote control for the evolution machine looks similar to a [[Wii]] Remote, and even has the wrist strap. Also, when Meowth presses the button on the remote to transform the machine into the robot, just after the click, he says "whee", sounding like "Wii".\n* {{TRT}} trying to use a machine that induces evolution, and the fact they try to use it on a {{p|Magikarp}} to evolve it into a Gyarados, could be a reference to the {{game|Gold and Silver|s}} games, where Team Rocket used a machine at [[Lake of Rage]] to try to force Magikarp to evolve into Gyarados.\n** This episode is also similar to \'\'[[EP235|Talkin\' \'Bout an Evolution]]\'\', where an evolution inducing machine was also used. The title of this episode is also similar to that of said previous episode.\n* Team Rocket tries to evolve {{AP|Pikachu}} in this episode, but they say they don\'t want it to evolve [[DP074|53 episodes after]].\n* Strangely, this episode was not included in the Japanese rental DVDs.\n* As the [[Magikarp salesman]] is talking about the years of top-secret research, a hexagon-shaped building is shown. This is a possible reference to the Pentagon, a United States government building.\n* [[Jessie\'s Wobbuffet]] doesn\'t appear in this episode.\n* The name of the B-Button League refers to the fact that in the [[core series]], the B button is used to stop evolution.\n* In Japan, this episode was included as a bonus feature on the DVD release of \'\'[[PK17|Pikachu\'s Island Adventure]]\'\'.\n\n===Errors===\n* When Team Rocket is waving goodbye to the Magikarp salesman, James\' black shirt is white.\n* When Magikarp uses {{m|Tackle}} on {{TP|Dawn|Piplup}}, Piplup\'s crown above its beak is white.\n** Magikarp\'s bottom fin is also white instead of yellow.\n* After {{an|Dawn}} lets Piplup out of his {{i|Poké Ball}}, Team Rocket, dressed up as the C-Button League, appears and Piplup disappears. It then reappears in the next scene.\n\n<gallery>\nDP021 error.png|Coloring errors\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FCC|bordercolor=99F\n|zh_cmn={{tt|最強的鯉魚王和最美麗的笨笨魚！|The Strongest Magikarp and the Most Beautiful Feebas!}}\n|cs={{tt|Naším cílem je evoluce|Evolution is our Goal}}\n|da={{tt|Nu er det tid til Evolution|It\'s time for Evolution}}\n|de={{tt|Die Poké-Weiterentwicklungsmaschine|The Poké-evolutionmachine}}\n|nl={{tt|Het is tijd voor een evolutie!|It\'s Time for an Evolution!}}\n|fi={{tt|Nyt on aika evoluution!|Now it\'s time of evolution!}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Viva l\'Evolution!|Hurray for the evolution!}}\n|he={{tt|כן, אנחנו רוצים התפתחות|Yes, we want an evolution}}\n|it={{tt|La macchina per l\'evoluzione|The evolution machine}} & {{tt|Allenatrici convinte|Confident Trainers}}\n|ko={{tt|가장 강한 잉어킹과 가장 예쁜 빈티나|The most powerful Magikarp and the most beautiful Feebas}}\n|pl={{tt|A my żądamy ewolucji!|And we want the evolution!}}\n|ru={{tt|Понимаешь нам нужна эволиция|}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Queremos uma Evolução!|We Want an Evolution!}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Nós Queremos Evolução!|We Want Evolution!}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Queremos la evolución!|We want the evolution!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Adelante con esa evolución|Go on with that evolution}}\n|sv={{tt|Man vill liksom ha lite evolution här|One would like to have a bit of evolution here}}\n|ro={{tt|Noi Chiar Vrem o Evoluție|We Really Want an Evolution}}\n|th={{tt|คอยคิงสุดแกร่งกับฮินบัสที่งดงาม!|The Strongest Koiking and the Most Beautiful Hinbass!}}\n}}\n\n\n\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=DP020 |\nprevtitle=Mutiny in the Bounty! |\nnextcode=DP022 |\nnexttitle=Borrowing on Bad Faith! |\nseries=Diamond & Pearl series |\ncolorscheme=Sinnoh}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0487}}\n[[Category:Diamond & Pearl series episodes|021]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Yukiyoshi Ōhashi]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded and directed by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Masaaki Iwane]]\n\n[[de:Die Poké-Weiterentwicklungsmaschine]]\n[[es:EP490]]\n[[fr:DP021]]\n[[it:DP021]]\n[[ja:DP編第21話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 钻石＆珍珠 第21集]]'}
