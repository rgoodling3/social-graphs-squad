Type Battle 3 VS 3!!\'\') is the 103rd episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on July 1, 1999 and in the United States on September 9, 2000. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://web.archive.org/web/20011006015324/http://www.pokemon.com/cartoons/cartoons_241_250.html-->\n<i>While on a ferry bound for Trovita Island, our heroes come across a young girl and her Seel drowning in a whirlpool. While Misty and her Staryu jump in the water and save them both, the young girl\'s brother watches the rescue through his binoculars and falls in love with Misty. It turns out that the brother also happens to be the Trovita Island Gym Leader that Ash is determined to beat! Before the battle can begin, Ash must pass the Gym Leader\'s "attack test" without letting his jealousy toward Misty\'s admirer get in the way!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nNow aboard a ferry from [[Trovitopolis]], {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} find that [[Trovita Island]] is surrounded by whirlpools and huge spiked rocks. {{AP|Pikachu}} spots a little girl and a {{p|Seel}} caught in the strong current, crying for help. Ash and {{an|Misty}} send out {{AP|Lapras}} and {{TP|Misty|Staryu}}, respectively, before Misty swims down to rescue the girl. As the group works together to bring the girl over to the island, a young man observes and is impressed by Misty\'s actions.\n\nWhile riding Lapras the rest of the way to Trovita Island, Ash and Misty ask the girl what she was doing out on the current. The girl, who introduces herself as [[Mahri]], says that she and her Seel were playing when the current sucked them in. As Lapras and the ship both arrive, the young man, who later introduces himself as [[Rudy]], arrives to embrace Mahri, who is revealed to be his sister, and thank Misty for rescuing her by offering flowers. Rudy hands {{TP|Misty|Togepi}} to Ash, and then dances with Misty. He compliments her and asks if she could train the other Trainers at his Gym, leaving the group awestruck. When Ash challenges Rudy, he tells him that he needs to pass a small attack test first.\n\nThe group heads off to Rudy\'s speedboat, where Ash must knock down all of the targets. Ash is successful with Pikachu on the first target, but Rudy is too preoccupied with looking at Misty. Ash sends out {{AP|Charizard}} next, but it shoots a Flamethrower that burns Misty. He quickly returns it, apologizes to Misty, and continues with {{AP|Squirtle}} and {{AP|Bulbasaur}}. He eventually passes the test. As night falls, Rudy schedules the three-round Gym {{pkmn|battle}} for the next day, and tells Ash to pick three [[Type|Pokémon types]] they\'ll use to battle each other with. Ash chooses {{t|Electric}}, {{t|Grass}}, and {{t|Water}}, after which Rudy invites Misty to join him and Mahri for dinner, leaving Ash, Pikachu, and Tracey alone. Ash calls {{an|Professor Oak}} on the telephone, and Oak wishes Ash luck in his match with Rudy. Tracey then butts in and shows Oak his latest Pokémon sketches, while Ash and Pikachu sit down to eat their dinner.\n\nMeanwhile, Rudy, Mahri, and Misty finish an exquisite dinner. They then head down to the Gym to see Rudy\'s Pokémon working out by dancing to music as a way of improving their skills. Rudy and Misty get out on the dance floor, shortly followed by Mahri and Togepi. Rudy asks Misty if she would stay with him and Mahri forever. She stops dancing to think about it, while Rudy tells her to make her decision after the match tomorrow.\n\nThe next morning, Ash and Rudy prepare to battle each other on top of one of the island\'s huge spikes. The spectators, including Misty, Togepi, Tracey, and Mahri, watch from a hot-air balloon, while one of Rudy\'s friends provides commentary while riding a {{p|Pidgeot}}. As the match begins, Ash sends out Pikachu, and Rudy uses {{p|Electabuzz}}. Pikachu tries to take down Electabuzz with {{m|Thunderbolt}} and {{m|Quick Attack}}, but Electabuzz defeats Pikachu with {{m|Thunder Punch}}, giving the first victory to Rudy.\n\nFor the next round, Ash sends out Bulbasaur, while Rudy sends out {{p|Exeggutor}}. Exeggutor easily avoids Bulbasaur\'s {{m|Razor Leaf}} by dancing around to avoid the leaves, then knocks Bulbasaur down with an {{m|Egg Bomb}}. However, Ash quickly orders Bulbasaur to use {{m|Sleep Powder}}, which puts Exeggutor to sleep, but also causes it to fall off the cliff. Bulbasaur immediately manages to rescue Exeggutor with its {{m|Vine Whip|vines}}.\n\nFor the third and final round, Ash sends out Squirtle, and Rudy sends out {{p|Starmie}} before dedicating the final victory to Misty. Squirtle and Starmie both attack each other with Water Guns, and Rudy quickly plays some music, causing Starmie to spin so much, it uses Thunderbolt to knock Squirtle into submission, leaving Ash horrified. After thinking over Rudy\'s offer, Misty yells at Ash to win since he can release Squirtle\'s hidden power. This causes Rudy to lose his concentration. Ash orders Squirtle to fight back; it escapes the Thunderbolt with another Water Gun, {{m|Withdraw}}s inside its shell as it is about to fall off the cliff, and then learns {{m|Hydro Pump}}, releasing it from its shell to fly back onto the battlefield. Squirtle then uses its new attack and {{m|Skull Bash}} to defeat Starmie, giving the final victory to Ash.\n\nAs the sun sets, Ash receives his {{Badge|Spike Shell}} from Rudy, who also offers Misty more flowers. Afterwards, the group boards Lapras and departs.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

He introduces [[Lawrence III]], and then talks about the tablet containing the legend. However, he says he cannot read the tablet, and he then tells viewers to watch the movie.\n* The mystery Pokémon in {{Tracey}}\'s sketch that he was showing to Oak is {{p|Elekid}}. Tracey asks if it could be a new Pokémon and Oak laughingly disagrees. The [[Pikachu short]] \'\'[[PK04|Pikachu\'s Rescue Adventure]]\'\', featuring the {{pkmn|anime}} debut of Elekid, aired weeks later in Japan, but aired three months before in the United States. [[Rudy]] uses an {{p|Electabuzz}} during his battle against Ash. However, it was hinted in [[EP102|the previous episode]]\'s Oak lecture that Oak might have known about its existence, since he referred to it in the lecture about \'\'Pikachu\'s Rescue Adventure\'\'.\n* The song used by Rudy to train his Pokémon is [[Pokémon (Dance Mix)]] (English dub only). The same song is also played at the background of {{p|Starmie}} and {{AP|Squirtle}}\'s battle.\n** Additionally, the music to which Rudy and {{an|Misty}} dance when they first meet is a rendition of the {{m|Surf}} theme from the [[Generation I]] handheld games.\n* The book [[The Four-Star Challenge]] is based on this episode.\n* The boat {{Ash}}, Misty, and Tracey arrive on at the start of the episode is marked \'\'PM-103\'\', a reference to the original episode number.\n* The official blurb for this episode currently on Pokémon.com lists the blurb for the previous episode. However, previous versions of the site prior to the 2013 overhaul listed the correct blurb.\n* This episode was adapted into the sixteenth chapter of [[The Electric Tale of Pikachu]] under the title "You Bet Your Wife!". In the manga adaptation, Rudy proposed to Misty; in the episode itself, Rudy only asks Misty to stay with him. Misty is also against staying with Rudy from the beginning in the manga, and encouraged Ash to beat him in battle; in the episode, Misty considers Rudy\'s offer for a moment before cheering Ash on and choosing to stay with him.\n* This is the first [[Orange Archipelago|Orange Islands]] episode whose English dub was released more than a year after the original Japanese release.\n\n===Errors===\n* When Ash is speaking to [[Mahri]] on {{AP|Lapras}} after rescuing her, the lower jaw of Lapras is blue instead of cream.\n* When Tracey yells at Ash for choosing {{AP|Charizard}}, Tracey is tanner than usual. He also looks this way after {{TRT}} blasts off.\n* Rudy says that Ash must knock down \'\'all\'\' the targets during the attack test in order to battle him, but even though Charizard fails to hit a target, Ash still passes the test.\n** This may have been because Rudy was paying more attention to Misty than to Ash\'s test.\n* When Rudy\'s Starmie is knocked out, the point that droops down to symbolize its loss of power is colored gold like its middle part rather than purple.\n* After {{MTR}} sneezes and knocks Team Rocket\'s submarine into the water, they start spinning around and [[Jessie]]\'s boot isn\'t colored in.\n* When Squirtle uses {{m|Hydro Pump}} on Starmie, its stomach is discolored blue.\n* When Jessie commands [[James]] and Meowth to pedal faster, her animation twitches.\n* In some scenes, Misty\'s shorts are entirely colored dark-cyan.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[Pikachu\'s Jukebox]]: [[Together Forever]]\n* \'\'[[EP105|Charizard Chills!]]\'\', \'\'[[EP106|Pokémon Water War]]\'\', and \'\'[[EP107|Pokémon Food Fight!]]\'\' were all aired before this episode in the U.S. This caused mass confusion to many American fans. The main one being is to why in the episode before, \'\'[[EP102|The Mystery Menace]]\'\', the group was so close to arriving to Trovita Island and then, all of a sudden, Ash has his Badge and is heading off somewhere else without the episode in which he fought the Rudy. However once the saga [[List of English language Adventures in the Orange Islands home video releases (Region 1)|came out on DVD]], they were put in the correct order.\n* This episode aired after \'\'[[EP064|It\'s Mr. Mime Time]]\'\' and before \'\'[[Snow Way Out!]]\'\' on the {{pmin|South Asia|Indian Disney XD}}, skipping \'\'[[Holiday Hi-Jynx]]\'\'.\n* In the dub, Rudy tells Ash that he is a "very lucky guy" at the end of the episode. When Ash asks what he means, Rudy tells him, "You\'ll find out someday." In the original Japanese version, Rudy simply tells Ash to take care of Misty, and calls him clueless when Ash doesn\'t understand.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FFDDAA|bordercolor=FFBB55\n|zh_cmn={{tt|柚子道館類型格鬥三比三|Yòuzi (Trovita) Gym Type Battle 3 VS 3}}\n|cs={{tt|Nápadník pro Misty|Suitor for Misty}}\n|da={{tt|Misty for en bejler|Misty gets a suitor}}\n|nl={{tt|Misty Neemt een Besluit|Misty makes a choice}}\n|de={{tt|Romantisches Insel-Abeneur|Romantic island-adventure}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Coup de foudre sous le soleil|Thunderbolt under the sun}}\n|he=מיסטי פוגשת את המתחרה שלה {{tt|\'\'Misty pogeshet et ha\'mitkhare shela\'\'|Misty meets her match}}\n|hi=Misty को मिला एक नया दोस्त! {{tt|\'\'Misty ko mila Ek Naya Dost!\'\'|Misty found a new friend!}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n|hu={{tt|Misty hódolója|Misty\'s Admirer}}\n|it={{tt|Lezioni di ballo|Dance lessons}}\n|no={{tt|Misty møter sin likemann|Misty meets her match}}\n|pl={{tt|Misty spotyka wielbiciela|Misty meets an admirer}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Misty Encontra um Par|Misty Finds a Partner}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Misty Conhece o seu Par|Misty Meets her Partner}}\n|ro={{tt|Misty Își Întâlnește Provocarea|Misty Meets Her Challenge}}\n|ru={{tt|Мисти делает выбор|Misty makes a choice}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Misty encuentra pareja!|Misty finds a match!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Misty conoce a su media naranja|Misty meets her match}}\n|sv={{tt|Misty får en beundrare|Misty gets an admirer}}\n}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP102 |\nprevtitle=The Mystery Menace |\nnextcode=EP104 |\nnexttitle=Bound For Trouble |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Orange}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0103}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|103]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Hideki Sonoda]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Yoshitaka Fujimoto]]\n[[Category:Episodes by one-time directors]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Shin\'ichirō Kajiura]]\n[[Category:Episodes with Gym battles]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which Ash gets a Badge]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Ash]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Misty]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a main character\'s Pokémon learns a new move]]\n\n[[de:Romantisches Insel-Abenteuer]]\n[[es:EP105]]\n[[fr:EP103]]\n[[it:EP103]]\n[[ja:無印編第103話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第104集]]'}
