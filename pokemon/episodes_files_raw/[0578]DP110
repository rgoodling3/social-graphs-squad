(Japanese: '''ゲンとルカリオ！''' ''{{tt|Gen|Riley}} and Lucario!'') is the 110th episode of the {{series|Diamond & Pearl}}, and the 576th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on January 15, 2009 and in the United States on June 13, 2009.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/12_06-steeling-peace-of-mind/-->\n<i>On Iron Island, Ash's rival Barry is training with his Empoleon and Heracross when Empoleon suddenly turns on its Trainer. Barry calls Ash and Dawn, who are still in Canalave Town, to tell them what happened—other Pokémon on Iron Island are acting strangely, too! Ash and his friends catch the next ferry to Iron Island, with Team Rocket following them in secret, but Barry has already gone out to explore the island. Whatever is happening, only Steel-type Pokémon are affected, but why?\n\nAsh and his friends search for Barry and encounter more Steel-type Pokémon running amok. Ash is even saved from an angry Aggron by a dapper Trainer, Riley, and his Lucario. Riley is a Steel-type Trainer who lives on Iron Island, and his Lucario uses its Aura to protect itself from the low-frequency wave that's driving other Steel-type Pokémon mad. Barry and his Heracross, off on their own investigation, spot a strange machine. Barry runs into Team Rocket and promptly blames them for everything, but Team Rocket denies that the machine is theirs. Barry and Team Rocket go to get a closer look, and discover that the machine is part of a Team Galactic operation headed up by Commander Mars!\n\nWhen Team Galactic spots them, Barry and Team Rocket put up a fight but are quickly overpowered and knocked into an ancient underground ruin. Up on the surface, Riley and our heroes have also tracked Team Galactic to the ruins, which are made of metal. Together with Team Galactic's Spear Key, this must be causing the low-frequency wave! Commander Mars releases the Spear Key and the Key melds with the ruins, which release a huge bolt of energy. The wave of energy knocks Lucario backwards; as it gets to its feet, it's overcome by a strange power and prepares to attack!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAs {{an|Barry}} practices on [[Iron Island]], {{p|Heracross}} and {{TP|Barry|Empoleon}} destroy a rock. Empoleon gets hit by some sort of electricity which later turns out to be a low frequency sound wave. It then starts to attack Barry and Heracross. Meanwhile, {{Ash}}, {{an|Dawn}} and {{an|Brock}} are getting prepared to leave [[Canalave City]] to head to Dawn's next Contest. Before they leave, Ash receives a call from Barry asking about how his training is going. Ash tells him about his win at the Canalave Gym. Barry is at Iron Island, and something is currently wrong with his Empoleon and some other {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} who've begun to act violently. [[Nurse Joy]] explains that she can't figure out why this is only happening to {{type|Steel}} Pokémon.\n\nThey take a ferry and go to Iron Island but when they get to the [[Pokémon Center]], they find out that Barry has already left. While exploring the island, the group find that all the Steel Pokémon are trying to hurt them and themselves. Suddenly, a huge {{p|Aggron}} comes up to them and is about to attack them when a man called [[Riley]] comes in to save the day and his {{p|Lucario}} gets rid of the Aggron. Lucario can use his [[aura]] to detect the waves and find out if there are any rampaging Steel Pokémon nearby, although he will not be affected because he can also use the aura to protect himself from the waves.\n\n{{TRT}}, who followed Ash and {{ashfr}} to the island, have a run in with many of the rampaging Steel types before Barry and his Heracross fall onto them. He accuses them of angering the Steel types, pointing out a device he spotted in the air but Team Rocket claim it was none of their doing. He leads them to the location, which turns out to be a [[Team Galactic]] base led by [[Mars]]. They try to fight Team Galactic with their Pokémon but it doesn't work. They then fall through a crevice into a small cave with {{p|Dialga}} and {{p|Palkia}} etchings.\n\nAsh and friends finally reach the base with Lucario's help. Eventually Mars picks up a key and inserts it into a slot into the ruins on the island and a powerful radio wave is sent out. Even Lucario can't fight the disturbance any more, and is about to attack the group while Ash and [[Riley]] try to calm it down.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} decides to head for [[Snowpoint City]] for his next [[Gym]] {{pkmn|battle}}.\n* Ash and {{ashfr}} meet [[Riley]].\n* {{an|Barry}} is revealed to have {{pkmn2|caught}} a {{p|Heracross}}.\n* The group encounters {{tc|Commander}} [[Mars]] of [[Team Galactic]] again.\n* Team Galactic excavates a mysterious temple and, using the [[Spear Key]], causes it to send out a strange beam that impacts [[Mt. Coronet]].\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* [[Riley]]\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* [[Riley's Lucario]]\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{an|Barry}}\n* [[Riley]]\n* [[Mars]]\n* {{tc|Galactic Grunt|Team Galactic Grunts}}\n* [[Nurse Joy]] (×2)\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Piplup}} ({{OP|Dawn|Piplup}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Croagunk}} ({{OP|Brock|Croagunk}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Yanmega}} ({{OP|Jessie|Yanmega}})\n* {{p|Carnivine}} ({{OP|James|Carnivine}})\n* {{p|Empoleon}} ({{OP|Barry|Empoleon}})\n* {{p|Heracross}} ({{an|Barry}}'s)\n* {{p|Staraptor}} ({{an|Barry}}'s)\n* {{p|Roserade}} ({{an|Barry}}'s)\n* {{p|Lucario}} ({{OP|Riley|Lucario}})\n* {{p|Golbat}} ({{tc|Galactic Grunt|Team Galactic Grunts}}'; multiple)\n* {{p|Purugly}} ({{OP|Mars|Purugly}})\n* {{p|Chansey}} ({{OP|Nurse Joy|Chansey}})\n* {{p|Aggron}}\n* {{p|Steelix}}\n* {{p|Metang}}\n* {{p|Lairon}}\n* {{p|Forretress}}\n* {{p|Scizor}}\n* {{p|Aron}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Graveler}}\n* {{p|Onix}}\n* {{p|Magnemite}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Geodude}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Skarmory}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Diglett}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Rattata}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Dialga}} (carving and statue)\n* {{p|Palkia}} (carving and statue)\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[Professor Oak's Big Pokémon Examination]]: {{p|Starmie}}\n* Music from ''[[M02|The Power of One]]'', ''[[PK07|Pikachu & Pichu]]'', and ''[[M09|Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea]]'' are used.\n* This is one of the few times where {{TP|James|Carnivine}} does not show affection for [[James]] after being called out of its {{i|Poké Ball}}.\n* This is the only episode featuring [[Team Galactic]] in which [[Saturn]] does not appear.\n* During the title card sequence in the Japanese version, the title card music from the {{series|Advanced Generation}} is played instead of the normal music.\n* The dub title for this episode may be a reference to the song ''Stealing My Peace of Mind'' by {{wp|Rhian Benson#Singles|Rhian Benson}}.\n* {{TRT}} doesn't blast off in this episode.\n* When {{TP|Riley|Lucario}} comes out of control due to contact with the beam, its [[Aura]] can be seen in a dark color, which is probably a reference to the [[Shadow Pokémon]] from {{g|Colosseum}} and {{g|XD: Gale of Darkness}}, that also do not hesitate in attacking humans and have dark Auras, as well as to {{p|Lucario}}'s relationship with Aura.\n\n===Errors===\n* After Lucario gets hit by the beam, the ground's color is the same as [[Riley]]'s trousers.\n* The {{pkmn2|wild}} {{p|Skarmory}} are hit and affected by [[Team Galactic]]'s {{p|Golbat}}'s {{m|Sludge Bomb}} despite being immune to {{type|Poison}} attacks.\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FCC|bordercolor=99F\n|zh_cmn={{tt|亞玄與路卡利歐！|Riley and Lucario!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|¡Robando Paz Mental!|Stealing Mind Peace!}}\n|cs={{tt|Kam se poděl náš klid?|Where is our peace?}}\n|da={{tt|Stålsat ravage!|Steely havoc!}}\n|de={{tt|Chaos auf der Eiseninsel!|Chaos on the Iron Island!}}\n|nl={{tt|Stalen zenuwen!|Nerves Of Steel!}}\n|fi={{tt|Teräskin taipuu!|Even steel bends!}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|L'étrange mal!|The strange evil!}}\n|it={{tt|Pace dello spirito, addio!|Goodbye, peace of mind!}} <!--Don't Delete anything here, Italian episodes are divided into two parts, which have different titles-->\n|no={{tt|Hypnotiske lydbølger!|Hypnotic sound waves!}}\n|pl={{tt|Stalowe poruszenie|Steel agitation}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Problemaço com os tipo Aço!|Big Problem with Steel-type}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Roubando a Paz de Espírito!|Stealing Peace of Mind!}}\n|ru={{tt|Не железное здоровье!|}} ''Ne zheleznoe zdorov'e!''\n|es_la={{tt|¡Acerando la serenidad!|Steeling the serenity!}}\n|sv={{tt|Stulet sinne!|Stolen mind!}}\n|ro={{tt|Furând Liniștea Minții|Stealing The Mind Peace}}\n|ko={{tt|루카리오와 파동술사 현이|Lucario and the Aura Guardian Riley}}\n}}\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=DP109 |\nprevtitle=Leading a Stray! |\nnextcode=DP111 |\nnexttitle=Saving the World from Ruins! |\nseries=Diamond & Pearl series |\ncolorscheme=Sinnoh}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0576}}\n[[Category:Diamond & Pearl series episodes|110]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Atsuhiro Tomioka]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded and directed by Masaru Koyama]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Masaru Koyama]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Masaru Koyama]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Izumi Shimura]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Barry]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Team Galactic]]\n\n[[de:Chaos auf der Eiseninsel!]]\n[[es:EP579]]\n[[fr:DP110]]\n[[it:DP110]]\n[[ja:DP編第110話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 钻石＆珍珠 第109集]]"}
