It was first broadcast in Japan on February 3, 2005 and in the United States on February 4, 2006. \n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/08_21-who-what-when-where-wynaut/-->\n<i>When Ash and May see Drew training his Masquerain, May can\'t resist the challenge of a practice match. Beautifly and Masquerain battle it out in a Silver Wind showdown that\'s interrupted by who else but Team Rocket and their Magikarp submarine! They use a giant vacuum to snatch the Pokémon but accidentally snatch the Trainers as well, and in the confusion, Max bumps the sub\'s engine switch. The submarine rockets off until it hits an island, sending everyone flying!\n\nNow Jessie, James, and Meowth need to find Wobbuffet. Brock, Max, and Ash need to find Drew and May. And Drew and May are found by Roderick, a one-time coordinator who knows the ins and outs of Mirage Island. But when Drew and May try to get a closer look at Mirage Island\'s famed Liechi Berries, they fall into a river!\n\nWynaut to the rescue! A herd of Wynaut rescue the pair and shelter them in their cave, where they\'ve got plenty of Liechi Berries to eat. Elsewhere, Wobbuffet reunites with Team Rocket, and they\'re inspired to steal the Liechi Berries from the Wynaut. May is kidnapped when she tries to stop them, but Drew and the Wynaut come running. Roderick and Ash\'s group realize foul play is afoot and show up just in time to help Drew battle Team Rocket.\n\nTeam Rocket is no match for teamwork—once Drew and May have their Pokémon perform a perfect double Silver Wind, it\'s all over! Team Rocket blasts off and Roderick helps everyone off the island. He also gives May a sweet souvenir that will help her in her upcoming contests: a basket of Liechi Berries to make great Pokéblock!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{ashfr|The group}} are gathered on the top of a cliff as {{Ash}} prepares himself psychologically for the [[Ever Grande Conference]]. Meanwhile, [[Drew]] is also doing some {{pkmn|training}} on another cliff. As a large wave approaches, Drew has his {{p|Masquerain}} use {{m|Silver Wind}} to destroy the wave before it hits. While everyone agrees it is impressive, Drew shrugs it off. {{an|May}} keenly shows Drew her four [[Ribbon]]s, admitting she is one short of entering the [[Hoenn Grand Festival]]. Drew, however, is unimpressed as he reveals his five Ribbons and remarks that the Grand Festival is six weeks away, plus the [[Pacifidlog Town]] {{pkmn|Contest}} is the last for this year\'s Contest season. May decides to set the record straight and challenges Drew to a {{pkmn|battle}}. Drew agrees, before smugly declaring that he needs a warm up. Before they can finish, {{TRT}} appears and attempts to steal {{AP|Pikachu}}. The vacuum on their mecha is too strong, however, and the entire group is pulled into their submarine. Max inadvertently presses a button after {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} makes an unannounced appearance, causing the sub to race out to sea and into a strong underwater rip. As a result, everyone is blasted into their air; they eventually land on a misty island.\n\n[[Jessie]], [[James]] and {{MTR}} are all together, but Wobbuffet is missing. Likewise, May and Drew find themselves separated from Ash and the others, and aren’t too thrilled to be stuck together. An old man, [[Roderick]], pilots a motorboat through the surrounding whirlpools to meet them and explains that they are on {{gdis|Mirage Island|III}}. May has never heard of it - but Drew has, and explains about the rare [[Liechi Berry|Liechi Berries]], perfect for making [[Pokéblock]]s, can only be found here. Roderick admits Mirage Island is a disorientating area, so he offers to help them find their friends. The three of them start heading to the river on Mirage Island, knowing that Brock will instruct Ash and Max to do the same. On the journey there, Roderick tells May and Drew of how he first discovered the island forty years ago. He was on route to the island in his search for Liechi Berries when his boat got caught in a whirlpool and he drifted ashore.\n\nJust as the three of them reach the river, Drew spots some Liechi Berries and runs to the river\'s side to investigate, followed by May. Roderick cries out warningly that the cliff is unstable, but before they can do anything, the ledge collapses, sending Drew and May into the river below. Roderick tries to save them by using his {{p|Bellsprout}}\'s {{m|Vine Whip}}, but is unsuccessful. May and Drew, both frantically trying to stay above the water, plunge over a waterfall and down into the next part of the river. While May emerges from the water quickly, Drew has fallen unconscious from the impact and May does her best to keep his head out of the water. When all seems lost, a group of {{p|Wynaut}} teams up to rescue the pair.\n\nAfter having no luck using their Pokémon to locate May and Drew, Ash, Max, and Brock arrive at the waterfall. Roderick is still there and he fills them in on what happened to May and Drew. The four of them begin to follow the river, hoping that the two {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s are both alright. Meanwhile, the Wynaut have taken May and Drew to their cave, where Drew finally wakes up, much to May\'s relief. After being given a Liechi Berry each by one of the Wynaut, May and her Pokémon go and play with the Wynaut while Drew watches.\n\nSomewhere else on the island, Team Rocket have followed the cry of a Wynaut that they believe to be Wobbuffet. By nightfall, they have not located it. It suddenly appears, however, eating a handful of Liechi Berries. Team Rocket follow it so they can get some also. Upon finding the berries, Team Rocket discovers the unappealing aftertaste. Regardless, they try to steal some with a large vacuum from a balloon shaped like a Wobbuffet. As they get closer to the Wynaut\'s cave, May and Drew hear the vacuum and run outside to see what is going on. As they watch the Liechi Berries get pulled from everywhere around the cave into the balloon, May is accidentally pulled inside as well, so Team Rocket tie her up. Drew calls on his {{TP|Drew|Roselia}}\'s assistance and the Wynaut also help battle [[Jessie\'s Seviper]]. He turns his attention to May, and has Roselia use {{m|Petal Dance}} to free her. Soon after, Roderick and the boys arrive on the scene after following the trail of berry-less trees. After {{AP|Pikachu}} {{m|Thunderbolt}}s Seviper into submission, Jessie and James call on {{TP|Jessie|Dustox}} and {{TP|James|Cacnea}} to deal with the [[twerp]]s. Cacnea aims a {{m|Pin Missile}} which Meowth boosts with a special energy cannon. Though the Wynaut intervene, using a combined {{m|Safeguard}} to protect the group. Pikachu lashes Team Rocket with a Thunderbolt, causing them to lose their stolen Liechi Berries. After a prolonged battle, Team Rocket are sent blasting off again with a combined Silver Wind attack from Drew\'s Masquerain and May\'s {{TP|May|Beautifly}}.\n\nAfterwards, Roderick escorts Drew and the group off Mirage Island in his boat. As they all marvel over the incredible Wynaut, Roderick presents May with a bowl of Liechi Berries. May is thrilled with the gift, declaring that they’ll come in use for the Grand Festival. Drew is quick to point that she still needs to win the Pacifidlog Contest, and May replies that she is up to the task.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} meet up with [[Drew]] again.\n* Drew is revealed to have obtained his fifth {{pkmn|Contest}} [[Ribbon]], thus qualifying him for the [[Grand Festival]].\n* {{an|May}} learns that there is only one Pokémon Contest remaining before the [[Hoenn Grand Festival]], and that the event itself will start in six weeks.\n* May has a {{pkmn|battle}} with Drew, which gets interrupted by {{TRT}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Drew]]\n* [[Roderick]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:PTC AG113.png|thumb|200px|right|Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]\n[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]: {{p|Victreebel}}\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Chimecho}} ({{OP|James|Chimecho}})\n* {{p|Swellow}} ({{OP|Ash|Swellow}})\n* {{p|Corphish}} ({{OP|Ash|Corphish}})\n* {{p|Combusken}} ({{OP|May|Combusken}})\n* {{p|Beautifly}} ({{OP|May|Beautifly}})\n* {{p|Skitty}} ({{OP|May|Skitty}})\n* {{p|Bulbasaur}} ({{OP|May|Bulbasaur}})\n* {{p|Mudkip}} ({{OP|Brock|Mudkip}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Dustox}} ({{OP|Jessie|Dustox}})\n* {{p|Cacnea}} ({{OP|James|Cacnea}})\n* {{p|Roselia}} ({{OP|Drew|Roselia}})\n* {{p|Masquerain}} ([[Drew]]\'s)\n* {{p|Bellsprout}} ([[Roderick]]\'s)\n* {{p|Wynaut}} (multiple)\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[Advance Adventure]] is used as background music.\n* This episode is featured on \'\'Volume 14: Wobbuffet\'\' from [[Viz Media]]\'s {{OBP|Pokémon All-Stars|Region 1}} series.\n* The English title of this episode is based on the {{wp|Five Ws}}: Who?

Though [[Aging in the anime|passage of time]] in the anime is heavily debated by fans, the first round of the Hoenn League did in fact air exactly three months after this episode, in the Japanese version.  \n\n===Errors===\n* When they meet [[Roderick]] and he tells Ash and {{ashfr}} about what happened to {{an|May}} and [[Drew]], Ash asks, "What?
