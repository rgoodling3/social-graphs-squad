It first aired in Japan on July 1, 2004 and in the United States on June 18, 2005. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/07_43-unfair-weather-friends/-->\n<i>Ash and the gang are headed to Fortree City when it starts raining and then snowing. They run for shelter and meet a Castform who leads them onward. The gang is greeted by two scientists from the nearby Weather Institute, Bart and Millie. Brock feels absolutely nothing for the attractive Millie, which puzzles him.\n\nMillie is showing the kids around the Weather Institute when a Team Aqua helicopter suddenly appears, and they restrain all the other scientists (plus Team Rocket). Team Aqua is looking for information on the Legendary Pokémon, Groudon and Kyogre. Bart gives his access card to Castform, who flees in search of Millie.\n\nInside the institute, Ash, Millie and friends reunite with Castform, fight off Team Aqua, and use the access card to get into the computer. Millie transfers all the data onto a disk and deletes the copy on the hard drive.\n\nOutside, Team Aqua uses the weather machine to create a bolt of lightning that sends Team Rocket blasting off. Millie gives Team Aqua the access card. A Team Aqua technician finds the files missing, and Millie reveals that she is in fact, a he—Brodie, the Man of a Thousand Faces, a member of Team Magma! He escapes with the disk.\n\nTeam Aqua leaves.  Bart is feeling betrayed, but then the real Millie shows up—and Bart puts her to work transferring all their paper files on the Legendary Pokémon back into the computer.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} continue towards [[Fortree City]]. The sunny day quickly turns to a torrential rainstorm and finally snow. After peculiar Pokémon floats in, Ash checks it out on his [[Pokédex]] and learns that it is a {{p|Castform}}, the {{pkmn|category|Weather Pokémon}}. As Castform begins to lead the group to safety, the weather turns sunny again and Castform\'s [[List of Pokémon with form differences|form]] changes with the weather. Castform leads them to its {{pkmn|Trainer}}, [[Bart]], a researcher at the [[Weather Institute]], and Bart\'s trainee, [[Millie]], who has a {{p|Ditto}}. {{an|Brock}}, enters into his pretty-girl-trance at the sight of Millie, but unexpectedly he stops his flirting and can\'t quite explain it. Meanwhile, {{TRT}} is snowed in, and appear to be enjoying themselves. Or at least {{MTR}} is; [[Jessie]] and [[James]] blame the crazy weather patterns on Ash and his friends.\n\nBart escorts the group to the Weather Institute, and explains that their giant satellite dish was responsible for the changing weather condition. At her boss\'s request, Millie takes the group on a guided tour of the facility. Team Rocket later spot the satellite and immediately make ill-fated plans to use it for nefarious ends. [[Team Aqua]] fly onto the scene soon afterwards, and in full force, also after the Weather Institute’s technology. [[Shelly]] and her grunts capture the researchers and Rocket trio, clamped in metal restraints. The trio escape their restraints by sucking in their stomachs, though their blabbering annoys Shelly. Team Aqua begins powering up the weather control machine, summoning a lightning storm. Bart quickly realizes Team Aqua interest in the [[Legendary Pokémon]] data, so he hands the data Pass Card to Castform and orders it to go to Millie. Castform ducks into a ventilation shaft with Team Aqua in pursuit. Ash, his friends, and Millie are watching action outside on security cameras. As Ash sprints into action, Millie points out that all the air ducts lead to the room they are currently in and correctly predicts that Castform will come to them, but two Team Aqua grunts soon arrive and spot Castform. Everyone but Ash and {{AP|Pikachu}} flees, and Pikachu knocks out the grunts with a {{m|Thunderbolt}}.\n\nMillie suggests that they delete the data from the main computer, but it\'s being guarded by Team Aqua. Millie\'s Ditto {{m|Transform}}s into Castform and lures the Aqua guards away. Millie then copies the data onto a disc and erases the master file. Meanwhile, Ash finds Ditto, who is still disguised as Castform, and carries it back to his friends and Millie, inadvertently leading the guards back to them. Ash calls out his {{AP|Torkoal}} to provide a smokescreen. The group exit the Institute only to run into Team Aqua and their leader. Shelly has the weather control machine brought online and threatens the captured scientists with a lightning storm unless Millie turns over the key card. Team Rocket are blasted off by a lightning bolt. Bart, unaware that Millie has deleted the data, begs her not to give in, though Millie hands it over. Ash and friends grin as Team Aqua soon discovers that the data has been destroyed. Then Millie taunts Shelly with the data disc and jumps to the top of the machine. Everyone looks at her, surprised as "Millie" is revealed to be [[Brodie]], a male member of [[Team Magma]] known for being a master of disguise. This explains Brock\'s lack of a reaction earlier. \n\nShelly orders her {{p|Crawdaunt}} to attack, though Brodie has Ditto quickly transform into a Crawdaunt. {{an|May}} gets involved in the {{pkmn|battle}}, but {{TP|May|Combusken}} is quickly taken out by a {{m|Crabhammer}} from Ditto. Brodie uses a jet pack and promptly escapes with the data and, for a change, the bad guys win this round. Shelly declares that she looks forward to defeating Team Magma next time before she and her grunts pull out. Afterwards, Bart is saddened that the Institute\'s data has been stolen and that "Millie" wasn\'t such a model employee afterall. The real Millie then arrives on the scene, all ready for her first day. Brock does his patented flirting, though [[Max]] pulls him away. Bart quickly puts Millie to work, showing her to a chaotic study, where he asks her to manually re-enter all of the stolen data into system. Millie gladly accepts the large data entry task.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- Events such as captures, releases go here. -->\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} encounter [[Brodie]] of [[Team Magma]].\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* [[Brodie]]\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Castform}}\n\n=====TV episode debuts=====\n* {{p|Kyogre}} (fantasy)\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Bart]]\n* [[Millie]]\n* [[Brodie]]\n* [[Shelly]]\n* {{tc|Team Aqua Grunt}}s\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:PTC AG083.png|thumb|200px|Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]\n[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]: {{p|Koffing}}\n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Torkoal}} ({{OP|Ash|Torkoal}})\n* {{p|Combusken}} ({{OP|May|Combusken}})\n* {{p|Ditto}} ([[Brodie]]\'s)\n* {{p|Castform}} ([[Bart]]\'s; debut)\n* {{p|Crawdaunt}} ({{tc|Team Aqua Grunt}}s\'; multiple)\n* {{p|Kyogre}} (fantasy)\n* {{p|Groudon}} (fantasy)\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[Full of Summer!!]] replaced [[Smile]] as the [[List of Japanese ending themes|Japanese ending theme]].\n* This episode, much like \'\'[[AG033|Now That\'s Flower Power!]]\'\' and \'\'[[AG069|Love, Petalburg Style!]]\'\', was named similarly to [[EP137|a Johto episode]] in the English, {{pmin|Latin America}}n, and {{pmin|Spain|Spanish}} dubs. \n** This episode\'s title is based on the phrase "fair weather friends", which is also the basis for the similarly named Johto episode.\n* This is the first time more than one transformation of two different kinds of Pokémon are seen: {{p|Castform}} transforming into its other forms, and {{p|Ditto}} transforming into a Castform and a {{p|Crawdaunt}}.\n* This is the first time that the [[Hoenn]] [[Pokédex]] is referred to as \'\'"Dextette"\'\' in the series in reference to its female voice (the former male equivalent always being referred to as \'\'"Dexter"\'\').\n\n===Errors===\n* When Team Rocket is complaining to Team Aqua about being captured, {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} is nowhere to be seen.\n* Right before Millie ([[Brodie]]) commands her (his) Ditto to {{m|transform}}, {{p|Castform}}\'s lower body is the wrong shape.\n* When Millie goes to transfer the data there is a blue dot on her forehead.\n\n<gallery>\nAG083 error.png|Castform error\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n====[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]====\n* Question: Trainers, which one of these Pokémon [[evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Weezing}}?\n* Choices: {{p|Cascoon}}, {{p|Koffing}}, {{p|Muk}}\n* Answer: OK, Trainers!
