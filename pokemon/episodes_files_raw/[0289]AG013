It was first broadcast in Japan on February 20, 2003 and in the United States on December 27, 2003. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/tv-episodes/season-6/episode-25-06_25-all-things-bright-and-beautifly/-->\n<i>Rustboro City is on the horizon, but they\'re not there yet. Ash, Brock, Max and May have just arrived at a Contest Hall. Janet and Chaz, two experienced Pokémon Coordinators, teach the gang all about Contests. Pokémon Contests are different from battles in that it\'s not the strength of the attack that matters, but the beauty of its execution. Winners get ribbons instead of badges. The gang decides that they want to try entering today\'s contest, but they\'re too late. All is not lost, however, because Chaz offers to teach Pikachu the Iron Tail attack. And Janet lets May assist her with during the contest. During the contest, Chaz and Janet both perform really well and make it to the final round. In the end, Janet\'s Beautifly steals the show! May is really impressed and she\'s determined to one day enter a contest herself.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nThe group arrives at [[Contest Hall|Rustboro Hall]]. {{Ash}} remarks that he is pumped for his upcoming [[Gym]] {{pkmn|battle}}, but [[Max]] informs him that the [[Rustboro Gym]] is still a day of walking away. Ash comments that it does not seem like anybody is {{pkmn|training}} for a {{pkmn|battle}} and [[Max]] assumes they must be preparing for an upcoming [[Pokémon Contest]]. Suddenly, a {{p|Beautifly}} lands on {{an|May}}\'s face before re-positioning itself on her head. May tosses and turns to get the Pokémon off her. Soon its {{pkmn|Trainer}}, [[Janet]], comes rushing towards the group to apologize, accompanied by her friend {{an|Chaz}} and his {{p|Venomoth}}. However, {{an|Brock}} is instantly enchanted by the woman’s beauty and begins flirting with her, only to have Beautifly land on his head. Janet orders Beautifly to stop landing on people. Max asks if they are practicing for the Pokémon Contest and Janet confirms, saying that Beautifly got scared amidst a training session. Chaz further explains that his Venomoth\'s {{m|Whirlwind}} was far too strong and it scared away Beautifly, and deems the attack a complete failure.\n\nAsh is confused to hear Chaz refer to a powerful attack as a failure. Chaz explains that a [[Contest Battle]] differs from a regular battle, with Janet adding that it is not the raw power that matters, but the beauty of the attack. She says that as [[Pokémon Coordinator]]s they train Pokémon to execute an attack in such a way that it increases its visual appeal. May mentions that she has heard of Pokémon Contests before and asks if the winner of these competitions is awarded with a [[Ribbon]], a question which Janet and Chaz answer by proudly showing the Ribbons they have won. Inspired by the different form of Pokémon competition, Ash, May, and {{an|Brock}} all decide to take part in the Rustboro Contest, but all three are denied entry as [[Jessie]], after renewing her expired [[Contest Pass]], grabbed the last remaining spot in the limited-entry convention.\n\nMay is disappointed that she will not be able to participate, so Max suggests that she assists Janet or Chaz during the competition, and Janet agrees. Meanwhile, Brock learns from Chaz that Coordinators keep their Pokémon looking good by feeding them [[Pokéblock]]s, nutritious snacks made out from {{Berries}}. Max comments that Janet\'s Pokéblocks must be the reason why Beautifly\'s wings are so beautiful and Janet thanks him for the compliment. After that, Chaz asks if the group is heading to Rustboro City for a Gym battle and Ash and May confirm it. Ash comments that he plans on using {{AP|Pikachu}}. Chaz and Janet explain that he might face some difficulties since the Rustboro Gym is a {{type|Rock}} [[Gym]]. Max informs May that she and {{TP|May|Torchic}} will have trouble as well, but then Chaz offers to teach Pikachu and Torchic an attack that would be effective against Rock Pokémon. Ash gladly accepts the offer, but May declines, still not sold on the idea of {{pkmn|journey}}ing across the [[Hoenn]] challenging [[Gym Leader]]s. Chaz sends out his {{p|Sentret}} to show Ash and Pikachu the {{type|Steel}} {{m|Iron Tail}} attack, which can deal [[damage]] to Rock-type Pokémon. \n\nMeanwhile, Jessie is reading a book hoping to learn how to win battles with stylish attacks. {{MTR}} asks why she wants to learn about that and she explains that she found out that people can become famous by winning Pokémon Contests. She adds that her new celebrity status may result in recruiting new [[Team Rocket]] members.\n\nThe Rustboro City Pokémon Contest gets underway as the [[Contest announcer|announcer]] introduces the panel of judges, formed by the Director of the {{pkmn|Activities Committee|Contest Committee}}, [[Raoul Contesta|Mr. Contesta]]; the [[Pokémon Fan Club Chairman|President]] of the {{pkmn|Fan Club|Pokémon Enthusiasts Club}}, [[Mr. Sukizo]]; and the [[Pokémon Center Nurse|operator]] of the local [[Pokémon Center]], [[Nurse Joy]]. He also displays the prize that will be given to the winning Coordinator, the Rustboro Ribbon, and states that any Coordinator who wins five Contest Ribbons may enter the [[Grand Festival]], similar to how eight [[Badge]]s may be used to enter the [[Pokémon League Conference]].\n\nBackstage, May is amazed by the Pokémon Contest environment as Janet explains to her how the [[Appeal|Appeals Round]] works. She reveals that first impressions are really important and that the judges will use criteria such as the level of cooperation between a Coordinator and Pokémon to evaluate each performance and assign points to the contestants. May is very impressed by everything she is learning and realizes how fascinating Pokémon truly are. Meanwhile, outside the Contest Hall, Ash and Pikachu are trying to perfect Iron Tail and this causes them to miss Chaz\'s performance, during which Chaz commanded his Venomoth to use {{m|Confusion}} to psychically pour tea from a teapot, earning 29.5 from the judges.\n\nAsh arrives in the Contest Hall in time for Janet\'s performance, which begins with Beautifly using {{m|Flash}}. Beautifly then uses {{m|String Shot}} to shatter some plates that were thrown by May and Max. The performance ends with a {{m|Hidden Power}} to create a glittering shower effect over the crowd, scoring Janet a perfect 30.0 points. The last contestant in the Appeals Round is Jessie, who is competing under the alias of "Mademoiselle Jessica" and using her {{TP|Jessie|Seviper}}. Her presentation turns out to be a fiasco as she commands Seviper to use moves that it cannot learn, such as {{m|Sacred Fire}} and {{m|Luster Purge}}. The crowd begins to boo and the judges are looking bored. {{MTR}} advises Jessie to call for a {{m|Poison Tail}} attack, but Seviper uses it to launch Jessie out of the Contest Hall. Jessie\'s appeal - or lack thereof - earns her a grand total of zero. The announcer apologizes for Jessie\'s lackluster performance and reveals the four highest-scoring Coordinators moving on to the Battle Round, which includes Janet and Chaz. Outside, Jessie apologetically hugs her Seviper and declares that its Poison Tail was incredible. Meowth announces his latest scheme, to steal the Pokémon belonging to the winning Coordinator. Jessie is thrilled by the idea, admitting that she was just about to mention it herself. \n\nBack in the Contest Hall, Janet and Chaz are about to face off in the finals. The battle begins with Venomoth using {{m|Stun Spore}}, which Beautifly counters with Gust. Both Coordinators lose points, but Chaz loses a little bit more than Janet. Max explains that although Venomoth\'s Stun Spore worked at first, it was then blown black by Beautifly\'s Gust. He adds that Gust was worth more points because the judges evaluate more than just the attack, they also take into account the way a Pokémon defends itself. Brock concludes that in a Contest Battle both sides must work to reduce each other\'s points and then the one with the most points left at the end of the five-minute time limit wins. He comments that this {{cat|Battle variations|variation of Pokémon battling}} is something they have never seen before and May agrees, still mesmerized by the competition. The battle wages on, as Beautifly eventually gets the upper hand after a well-controlled Hidden Power Attack hits its mark. Venomoth\'s scores a direct hit with {{m|Psybeam}}, causing Janet to lose a large amount of points. Beautifly returns to the air once again with thanks to a {{m|Morning Sun}}, and the dazzling light show leads to Chaz losing some more points. May is also impressed and wishes she could enter a Pokémon Contest and battle just like Janet and her Beautifly. When time runs out, the announcer calls attention to the scoreboard, which shows Janet to be just ahead of Chaz on points. With that, Janet is declared the winner of the Rustboro Contest. \n\nBefore Janet can be awarded the Ribbon, a [[List of Team Rocket\'s disguises|disguised]] {{TRT}} appears saying they are there as part of a congratulatory committee. The trio of crooks manage to distract Janet and Chaz with a bouquet containing a hidden smoke bomb. When the smoke clear, the Rocket trio remove their disguises and recites their {{motto}} with both Beautifly and Venomoth captured in bug-catching nets. Ash and {{ashfr}} stand out of their seats. When Jessie sends out Seviper, Ash commands Pikachu to use Iron Tail, but the [[move]] fails. May, however, has Torchic {{m|Tackle}} Seviper before using {{m|Ember}} to free Beautifly and Venomoth, and the two {{type|Bug}} Pokémon combine their Gust attacks to send Team Rocket flying. When all is resolved, Mr. Contesta awards Janet with the prestigious Rustboro Ribbon, her third Contest Ribbon overall. May asks to see the Ribbon and assures Janet that she will enter a Pokémon Contest someday and win herself a Ribbon.\n\nJanet and Chaz wish May and Ash good luck in their future endeavors as the Rustboro City Pokémon Contest comes to a close. As it turns out, the Pokémon Contest was just as eventful for Ash and May as it was for Janet and Chaz. May will be leaving the Contest Hall having learned more about the charms of Pokémon while Ash has learned a new attack for Pikachu, which will come in handy during [[AG016|his next Gym challenge]].\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}}, {{an|May}}, [[Max]], and {{an|Brock}} go to their first [[Pokémon Contest]].\n* [[Jessie]] is revealed to own a [[Hoenn]] [[Contest Pass]], which she has renewed.\n* Ash, Brock, May, and Max get a Hoenn Contest Pass.\n* May becomes interested in Pokémon Contests.\n* Ash learns that the [[Rustboro Gym|first Hoenn Gym]] is a {{type|Rock}} [[Gym]].\n* Ash begins to teach {{AP|Pikachu}} {{m|Iron Tail}} in preparation for the Gym {{pkmn|battle}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* [[Raoul Contesta]]\n* [[Mr. Sukizo]]\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n=====TV episode debuts=====\n* {{p|Flaaffy}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* [[Max]]\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{an|Chaz}}\n* [[Janet]]\n* [[Raoul Contesta]]\n* [[Mr. Sukizo]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* [[Contest announcer]]\n* {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s\n* {{tc|Team Rocket Grunt}}s (fantasy)\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP AG013.png|thumb|200px|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Magcargo}}\n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Taillow}} ({{OP|Ash|Taillow}})\n* {{p|Treecko}} ({{OP|Ash|Treecko}})\n* {{p|Torchic}} ({{OP|May|Torchic}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Beautifly}} ([[Janet]]\'s)\n* {{p|Venomoth}} ({{an|Chaz}}\'s)\n* {{p|Sentret}} ({{an|Chaz}}\'s)\n* {{p|Jynx}} (Coordinator\'s; Japanese version only)\n* {{p|Flaaffy}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Ninetales}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Persian}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Marill}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Slugma}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Smeargle}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Elekid}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Poochyena}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Lotad}} (Coordinator\'s)\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:Rustboro Contest Announcer.png|thumb|220px|The announcer]]\n* The title is a parody of the song "{{wp|All Things Bright and Beautiful}}".\n* This episode contradicts a lot of what later became canon or frequent about [[Pokémon Contest]]s.\n** The Pokémon Contests are called Pokémon Competitions in the dub of this episode only.\n** This is the only Pokémon Contest in [[Hoenn]] not to be [[Contest announcer|hosted]] by [[Vivian Meridian]].\n** [[Mr. Sukizo]] wears a different outfit than his usual one, a sweatshirt with a {{i|Poké Ball}} print on it.\n** It is mentioned that when a {{pkmn|Coordinator}} has five [[Ribbon]]s, they earn the title of [[Top Coordinator]]. However, it would later be established that only a Coordinator who has won the [[Grand Festival]] earns that title.\n* [[Jessie]] and [[James]]\'s disguises are the same ones they used as stylists in \'\'[[EP028|Pokémon Fashion Flash]]\'\'.\n* [[Advance Adventure]] is used as background music.\n\n===Errors===\n* In the dub, the {{p|Slugma}} is heard saying "{{p|Magcargo}}" instead of its own name.\n* When {{an|May}} recalls what Pokémon Contests are about, the part of her bandanna that is usually filled in with white is left red. The red lining is colored white instead.\n* [[Jessie]]\'s expired [[Contest Pass]] (purplish in color) turns into the new Contest Pass (yellowish in color) in one shot when she is registering for a Pokémon Contest.\n* When the group is watching [[Janet]] and {{an|Chaz}}\'s {{pkmn|battle}}, {{an|Brock}}\'s shirt sleeves are given an orange lining.\n* This is yet another episode that states that {{type|Electric}} Pokémon have a disadvantage against {{type|Rock}}s. This is likely because every [[Generation I]] Rock-type Pokémon, excluding those resurrected from [[Fossil]]s, have {{type|Ground}} secondary characteristics.\n* After {{AP|Pikachu}}\'s {{m|Iron Tail}} fails, {{Ash}} is missing the spikes in his hair.\n* In the {{pmin|Poland|Polish}} dub, when Jessie apologizes to her {{TP|Jessie|Seviper}}, she mistakenly calls {{m|Poison Tail}} \'\'"Poison Fire"\'\'.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:AG013 Error.png|The miscolored bandanna\nFile:AG013 Error 2.png|Jessie\'s Contest Pass\' miscoloration\nFile:AG013 Error 3.png|Brock\'s miscolored sleeves\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n[[File:AG013 deleted scene.png|thumb|220px|Deleted scene]]\n* In the Japanese version, a Coordinator is shown using a {{p|Jynx}}. However, because Jynx had been depicted with [[Pokémon controversy#Racism|black skin instead of purple]], she was cut from the English dub. This was also the last time Jynx appeared in the {{pkmn|anime}} in her original design.\n* The Team Rocket fantasy involving winning a Pokémon Contest was heavily edited (most likely because the grunts in the fantasy were doing a salute [[Pokémon controversy#Perceived Nazi imagery|similar to the "Heil Hitler" salute of the Nazis]]).\n* The ellipsis in the \'\'To be continued\'\' message was painted away in the dub.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:AG013 original shot.png|Original Japanese version\nFile:AG013 dub shot.png|Dubbed English version\n</gallery>\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=9999FF|bordercolor=FF7777\n|zh_cmn={{tt|神奇寶貝華麗比賽！狩獵鳳蝶的華麗戰鬥！！|Pokémon Contest!
