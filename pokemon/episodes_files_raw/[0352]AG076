It was first broadcast in Japan on May 13, 2004 and in the United States on April 30, 2005.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/07_36-me-myself-and-time/-->\n<i>The kids are crossing a mountain in the fog, and Ash trips and slides down a cliff with Pikachu. He encounters a mysterious woman singing a strange song.\n\nPikachu stops a Baltoy from spinning off a cliff. Its Trainer, a girl named Callista, arrives and explains that she is searching for ancient artifacts from the Baltoy civilization. Her parents forbid her to search, but a mysterious phone call sent her to the mountain that day.\n\nTeam Rocket is also on the mountain, and they attack the mysterious woman, who fights them off with her Xatu. Callista and Ash help fight the thieves off, and the woman leads them to a cave with the ruins that Callista has been searching for. A pile of rubble lies on top of the most important artifact, and the woman explains that her Baltoy is trapped under it. Callista\'s Baltoy clears the rock and frees the other Baltoy.\n\nTeam Rocket attacks again with a drilling machine, but they are driven back and sent blasting off as usual. The woman explains to the kids that the artifact is a time machine and reveals the truth to them—that she is a future version of Callista! She explains that she spent her whole life searching for the Baltoy civilization and now has no time to study it—but now the younger Callista can. The elder Callista disappears into the machine with her Baltoy.\n\nThe kids leave the ruins, and Ash reunites with his friends, in a hurry to get to his next Gym battle.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{ashfr|The group}} makes their way through the fog-filled forest on [[Kirikiri Mountain]], though {{Ash}} quickly becomes separated from the others. {{TRT}} are trying to follow the [[twerp]]s, but are finding themselves lost in the foggy conditions. Ash soon slips down a steep hill, and at the bottom he and {{AP|Pikachu}} hear singing. They begin to walk towards the source. Through the fog they make out what appears to be a woman in a burgundy robe with glasses, chanting a song. Ash rushes off to find his friends, but he encounters a {{p|Baltoy}} instead. \n\nBaltoy spins towards a cliff, so Ash has Pikachu use a {{m|Quick Attack}} to try to stop it. Baltoy\'s Trainer, a girl named {{OBP|Calista|AG076}} then rushes in and gets angry at Ash for attacking her Baltoy. Ash explains that Baltoy was headed for the cliff, so she apologizes and thanks him instead. Calista pulls a book from her backpack and reveals that she and Baltoy are on the hunt for ancient artifacts. She explains that she wants to become an archaeologist despite her parent\'s wishes. She received a phone call from a strange woman that told her to come to the Kirikiri Mountain ruins with her Baltoy, adding that all of the articles in the book are true. Calista reveals that a song in her book holds the key to finding the ruins. As she begins singing, Ash recognizes the tune and begins singing as well. Calista is taken aback, but Ash explains that he heard it from a woman nearby. \n\nTogether the pair set off to locate the mysterious woman, with Team Rocket overhearing the plan and setting their sights on the rumored ancient treasures. The Rocket trio confront the woman, but she replies that her song isn\'t for them. Team Rocket then launches into their {{motto}}. After the woman refuses to reveal her secrets, Jessie and [[James]] send out their Pokémon to deal with her. The woman calls out her {{p|Xatu}} to {{m|Reflect}} {{TP|James|Cacnea}}\'s {{m|Pin Missile}}. Xatu then {{m|Teleport}}s behind Cacnea and begins {{m|Peck}}ing it. Halfway through the confrontation, Ash and Calista appear, interrupting their battle. James orders Cacnea to attack, but Baltoy uses {{m|Rapid Spin}} to deflect the Pin Missile attack back at Team Rocket. Jessie orders {{TP|Jessie|Seviper}} to attack, but Pikachu zaps it with {{m|Thunderbolt}} first. The mysterious woman has Xatu send Team Rocket sky high with a {{m|Shadow Ball}}.\n\nAfterwards, Calista begs the woman to take her down "Baltoy\'s path", like in the song. The lady guides them into a large tree hollow, and after chanting her song the floor beneath their feet unexpectedly opens up. Their rapid descent leads them to ancient ruins. Calista notices the ancient glyphs on the wall, recognizing them as hallmarks of the Baltoy civilization. The woman points the pair to an ancient altar covering in rocks, which she tells them that there had been an earthquake and had knocked part of the wall down, trapping within it, the her own Baltoy. Calista tells Baltoy to use {{m|Confusion}} on the rocks, helping to liberate the other Baltoy. The woman quickly recalls her Baltoy back to its {{i|Poké Ball}} to rest up. Calista informs the lady that in her book it said that nobody had discovered the ruins yet. The lady takes out the same book, but it has a much more worn out appearance. She tells Calista that the book was the one that convinced her that all of the ancient artefacts really existed. She also tells her that her parents didn\'t want her to become an archaeologist. Calista tells her she has exactly the same problem.\n\nThe strange lady tells Calista to use Baltoy\'s {{m|Rapid Spin}} in the middle of the wheel of drawings when suddenly Team Rocket barges in unannounced with a steel driller. The mecha grabs Calista\'s Baltoy with it extendable arm. As {{MTR}} brags that nothing can defeat steel, Ash realizes that Pikachu\'s Thunderbolt works and the attack helps free Baltoy. Calista then uses her Baltoy\'s Rapid Spin and they bring Team Rocket\'s [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|machine]] down. Xatu sends Team Rocket blasting off with its Shadow Ball attack. The ritual continues where it left off and Baltoy spinning causes the magic wheel to erupt with yellow light. The woman walks forward and confidently steps into the light before confessing that she is Calista, but of the future. She tells them that the most valuable treasure that the Baltoy civilization gave the world was time. She explains that the reason for coming was to encourage Calista to never give up her dream and continue her research. Calista from the future tells her that you only have one life, one chance to change the future. With those words, she vanishes. Calista thanks Ash for his assistance before running off. Later, Ash meets up with the others, eager to get to the next [[Gym]], now understanding what a precious gift time is.\n\n==Major events==\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{P|Baltoy}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* Present {{OBP|Calista|AG076}}\n* Future {{OBP|Calista|AG076}}\n* Calista\'s parents (flashback)\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:PTC AG076.png|thumb|200px|right|Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]\n[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]: {{p|Crobat}}\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Cacnea}} ({{OP|James|Cacnea}})\n* {{p|Baltoy}} ({{OBP|Calista|AG076}}\'s; debut)\n* {{p|Xatu}} ({{OBP|Calista|AG076}}\'s; from the future)\n{{right clear}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* The English dub title is based on the phrase "\'\'me, myself, and I\'\'".\n* One of the clay artifacts in this episode also appeared in \'\'[[EP163|Fossil Fools]]\'\', which originally aired over three-and-a-half years prior, and later again in \'\'[[DP181|Bucking the Treasure Trend!]]\'\', over six years later.
