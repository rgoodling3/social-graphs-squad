Professor Kukui has arranged a special lesson for them, complete with a guest coach: Oluolu, the star player of the Magikarp team that just won the Pro League season.\n\nAfter the students’ game, Team Rocket shows up to demand a Pokémon Base battle—with the winning team getting the star’s autograph. Oluolu teams up with the students, and it’s a close match until he unleashes his secret weapon: his Snorlax partner’s Z-Move, Pulverizing Pancake!\n\nIn appreciation for a good game, Oluolu offers Jessie his autograph anyway—but Bewear charges through and carries Team Rocket off before she can accept!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAt {{an|Professor Kukui}}\'s house, {{Ash}}, {{Rotom}}, {{AP|Rockruff}} and Professor Kukui are watching [[Baseball|Pokémon Base]]. They watch as the pitcher throws a ball at {{p|Gyarados}} who hits the ball into the wall. [[Oluolu]] takes his place to bat knowing he must get Gyarados and himself home to win the game. Oluolu hits the ball and sends it out of the park. The next day at [[Pokémon School|School]], the class discuss the game. Professor Kukui tells them that Pokémon Base will be what today\'s class will all be about. They have invited Oluolu to teach the class and are joined by [[Samson Oak]]. Outside, {{an|Kiawe}}, {{an|Mallow}}, {{an|Lillie}} and there Pokémon are one team with Ash, {{an|Sophocles}}, {{an|Lana}} their partners on the other. The adults are acting as commentators as Oluolu explains the rules. Kiawe pitching the ball but Ash misses it. Soon the teams switch with Kiawe batting. Pikachu throws the ball which Kiawe hits. Sophocles runs around and catches the ball.\n\nThe game continues and Lana is the last one to bat. She surprises everyone when she hits the ball hard, sending it out of the park and giving them a home run. A disguised {{TRT}} are walking past with [[Jessie]] holding a picture of Oluolu. {{MTR}} is hit by the ball. They run into the school where Jessie spots Oluolu. Ash\'s team are declared the winners as Jessie makes their presence known and recite their {{motto}}. Jessie is keen to get Oluolu\'s autograph but they don\'t believe her. Oluolu gets involved and suggests they settle the dispute by having a game of Pokémon Base, which Jessie agrees to. Discussing tactics, James notes that they have a disadvantage with Oluolu on the other team. Jessie hits the ball and starts running the wrong way, causing Jessie to be out. The teams switch only for {{TP|Jessie|Mimikyu}} to throw the ball hard. Ash accuses Team Rocket of cheating, so they change pitcher. Kiawe is struck out as Meowth chuckles at his performance. Oluolu hits the ball and reaches safety. To win the game, Snorlax has to get home as Meowth vows that they will win. \n\nThe ball strikes Snorlax\'s bat and {{TP|James|Mareanie}} grab its. Mareanie runs over to James and hugs him affectionately. Oluolu makes it home but Snorlax has yet to run. Oluolu pulls out his secret weapon, a [[Z-Ring]] and powers up and has Snorlax use {{m|Pulverizing Pancake}} which sends Snorlax running for home as Meowth throws the ball towards {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}}. Wobbuffet catches the ball, only to be flattened by Snorlax as Professor Kukui declares Snorlax safe. Professor Kukui wraps up the game announcing the school has won as Jessie cries over not getting Oluolu\'s autograph only for Oluolu to come over and give her the autograph for a wonderful game but as Jessie goes to take the autograph, she along with the others are scooped up by {{an|Bewear}} who arrives to carry them off to its den, preventing Jessie from getting Oluolu\'s autograph. After watching Team Rocket go, Oluolu thanks everyone for bringing back memories from when he began playing Pokémon Base.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
