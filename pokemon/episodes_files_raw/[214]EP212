Line of {{tt|Chonchie|Chinchou}}!!\'\'), is the 212th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on August 23, 2001 and in the United States on September 28, 2002.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/05_03-takin-it-on-the-chinchou/-->\n<i>On their way to the Whirl Cup competition, Ash and friends are fortunate enough to pass a small mountain village just as an annual Chinchou migration is about to occur. Long ago seismological forces had combined to lift the mountain out of the depths of the sea, bringing along with it the undersea nesting ground of these Chinchou. Guided by instinct, these sea Pokémon continue to lay eggs there even though the land is now above water. Ash and friends join a father and son appointed this year by the village to protect the Chinchou on their journey—and it\'s a good thing these Pokémon Trainers were along because it turns out Team Rocket has designs on the migrating Chinchou as well.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} are riding a cable car to what they think is [[Bluefinland]], where they want to take a ferry to [[Yellow Rock Isle]]. The overhead announcement reveals that the cable car is actually stopping at another town called [[Blue Lagoon]]. {{an|Brock}} states that if they miss the next ferry, they\'ll have to wait another three days for another one, but Ash assures his friends that he\'ll think of a solution. Suddenly, a {{p|Chinchou}} appears in front of them, and a curious Ash pulls out [[Pokédex|Dexter]] for extra information. {{an|Misty}} is instantly keen to add a new Water Pokémon to her team and tosses a {{i|Poké Ball}} at it, but the Poké Ball bounces off the Chinchou. A boy\'s voice is heard, yelling the name "Bright"; the boy gets to the Chinchou, but it hops away. Ash goes around and cuts the Chinchou off, but it ends up using {{m|Spark}} on Ash. The boy demand Chinchou apologize, but Ash admits that he shouldn\'t have grabbed one of its antennae. The boy introduces himself as [[Dayton]] and is thrilled to meet the group of {{pkmn|Trainer}}s. Ash informs him that they are hoping to reach Bluefinland, and Dayton replies that he is going there for the [[Parade of the Chinchou]]. Ash is pleasantly surprised and asks if Bright will be leading them there, only to receive a powerful Spark attack in return. {{TRT}}, spies on the group, and [[Jessie]] is keen to steal the Chinchou for herself.\n\nAsh gives {{an|Professor Oak}} a call from Blue Lagoon\'s [[Pokémon Center]]. He asks the Professor why the Chinchou, a sea dwelling Pokémon, is up in the mountains. Oak explains that the [[Whirl Islands]] were once part of the seafloor, but geological forces led them to rise out of the sea as the islands of today. He reveals that the Blue Lagoon is an ancient breeding ground for the Chinchou, and that every year the Chinchou make their way up the mountain to lay their {{pkmn|Egg}}s and later return to the ocean. Dayton says that the Parade of the Chinchou is a festival that commemorates the Chinchou\'s return to the ocean. He then informs the group that he and [[Daizō|his father]] will be leading this year\'s parade. Dayton later asks his father if Ash and his friends can join the parade. Daizō happily agrees to have the extra help.\n\nThe Parade of the Chinchou soon begins. Daizō\u200e\u200e blows on a whistle and the lake begins to glow, with the glow getting closer and closer. The gathered crowd wait anxiously and beating drums make for a festive atmosphere. Bright flashes its antennae at the lagoon and the other Chinchou emerge from the waters to begin their procession to the ocean. Dayton and Bright take the front, while Daizō will manage the Chinchou from behind. The Blue Lagoon crowd waves to the migrating Chinchou and splashes them with water to keep them from drying out. The procession suddenly stops at a rope bridge, but with some encouragement the Chinchou make the crossing. Ash, Dayton and some of the Chinchou reach the other side and notice a tall watch tower ahead. Team Rocket reveal themselves and perform their {{motto}}. {{MTR}} gets out a device and presses the button on it, but nothing happens. {{an|Brock}}, Misty, Daizō,\u200e and half of the Chinchou seize this opportunity to run across back to the other side just as Meowth finally fires a missile. The missile drapes its net over the entire bridge and pulls it out of the ground. The overwhelming weight leads the missile and the bridge to plummet into the river below. Team Rocket are set on catching the Chinchou, but Bright delivers a paralyzing {{m|Thunder Wave}} and Pikachu blasts the trio off with a {{m|Thunderbolt}}.\n\nSeeing that there is no way to get across the river, the two parties decide to split up. After a while, Bright gets tired and stops, as do all of the other Chinchou. Dayton suggests that they should get some water; Ash sends out Totodile and orders it to use {{m|Water Gun}} as a rain effect. It energizes all of the Chinchou, after which they come across a mountain pass as the night passes on. Dayton steps on a loose rock and falls into the valley below. Sometime later, Dayton wakes up at the bottom, feeling lost as there is no other way back up. His leg appears bruised, and the sudden rainfall makes for a miserable wait for help. Ash searches for Dayton, but Bright senses something and makes its way down a path into the valley. Dayton starts to hear Bright and sees the light they produce, whereupon he meets up with Ash.\n\nThey walk through the forest again. Despite the dense morning fog, they finally arrive at the beach, where Brock, Misty, and the others are already there. The Chinchou start to run towards each other, but as soon as they meet up, they get caught in a pitfall. When the dust clears, it is revealed that Team Rocket is in their balloon, and has caught the Chinchou. [[James]] sends out {{TP|James|Weezing}} and it uses {{m|Smokescreen}}, creating a thick cover for their escape. Pikachu tries using {{m|Thunder Shock}} but misses. Dayton calls for Bright to shine its light so they can see them. The Chinchou start to glow and the light seeps through the smoke. Ash sends out {{AP|Bayleef}} and Totodile. Totodile makes a hole in the smoke with Water Gun, followed by Bayleef using {{m|Razor Leaf}} to cut the cages, but to no avail. Dayton then yells to the Chinchou to use Thunder Wave; this succeeds in breaking the cage, and the Chinchou land in the ocean. Pikachu follows up with a Thunderbolt, and Chinchou add an amplified Spark to the attack, sending Team Rocket blasting off.\n\nBright returns to Dayton at the shore, not wanting to leave just yet. Dayton tells Bright he will be alright, just as a wave sweeps up Bright. Dayton wishes his friend all the best as the Chinchou\'s reflected yellow glow fades into the distance. Meanwhile, Team Rocket float in the ocean, waiting for something to help them. They see a bunch of yellowish bulbs and think a rescue has come. When they jump on them, the Chinchou shocks them again. Later, Ash and his friends arrive in Bluefinland. The group catches a ferry to Yellow Rock Isle, saying their goodbyes to Dayton and Daizō\u200e while doing so. At the last minute, on a wave barrier, a lone {{p|Corsola}} sits. Misty almost dives towards it, but Ash and Brock restrain her from jumping off.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{an|Misty}} tries to {{pkmn2|caught|catch}} a {{p|Chinchou}}, but fails due to it already having a {{pkmn|Trainer}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n=====TV episode debuts=====\n* {{p|Chinchou}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n[[File:PMTV EP212.png|thumb|200px|{{tt|Pocket Monster TV|Who\'s That Pokémon}}]]\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{an|Professor Oak}}\n* [[Dayton]]\n* [[Daizō\u200e]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP EP212.png|thumb|200px|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Smoochum}} \'\'(US and international)\'\', {{p|Chinchou}} \'\'(Japan)\'\'\n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Togepi}} ({{OP|Misty|Togepi}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Bayleef}} ({{OP|Ash|Bayleef}})\n* {{p|Totodile}} ({{OP|Ash|Totodile}})\n* {{p|Weezing}} ({{OP|James|Weezing}})\n* {{p|Chinchou}} ([[Dayton]]\'s; Bright; released)\n* {{p|Chinchou}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Corsola}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* The English title of this episode is a pun of the phrase "\'\'Taking it on the chin\'\'".\n* The costumes that {{TRT}} is wearing at the beginning of the episode are the same costumes that they wore in the episode \'\'[[EP123|Spinarak Attack]]\'\', when they were pretending to be [[The Black Arachnid]].\n* Music from \'\'[[PK01|Pikachu\'s Vacation]]\'\' and \'\'[[M02|The Power of One]]\'\' can be heard in this episode.\n* {{an|Misty}} narrates the preview for the [[EP213|next episode]].\n\n===Errors===\n* {{MTR}} breaks the launcher control for Team Rocket\'s "capture missile" in half while trying to make it launch, but after the rocket has taken off, the controller is once again whole and undamaged. However, this may simply be an example of [[anime physics]].\n* [[Daizō]] calls his son "Payton" instead of [[Dayton]] once.\n* {{Ash}} pluralizes {{p|Chinchou}} as "Chinchous". However, names of Pokémon are never pluralized with an S, so the correct term would simply be "Chinchou".\n* When {{AP|Pikachu}} tries to attack Team Rocket through the {{m|Smokescreen}}, Jessie says Pikachu\'s {{m|Thunder}} won\'t work. However, he is using {{m|Thunder Shock}} instead.\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|bg={{tt|Среща с Чинчоу|Encounter with Chinchou}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|向大海出發吧，燈籠魚大遊行|Set out towards the high seas, Chinchou\'s big parade}}\n|nl={{tt|De Trek Van De Chinchou!|The migration of the Chinchou!}}\n|de={{tt|Die große Lampi-Parade|The big Chinchou parade}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|La parade|The parade}}\n|he=תהלוכת הצ\'ינצ\'ואים {{tt|\'\'Tahalukhat ha\'Chinchouim\'\'|The Chinchou(s) parade}}\n|hi=Chinchou हमे याद रखना {{tt|\'\'Chinchou, hame yaad rakhna\'\'|Don\'t forget us, Chinchou/Be sure to remember us, Chinchou}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n|it={{tt|La parata|The parade}}\n|pl={{tt|Prowadź nas, Chinchou|Lead us, Chinchou}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Uma Parada Eletrizante|An electrifying parade}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Um Desfile Electrizante|An electrifying parade}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Acompañando a los Chinchou|Traveling with the Chinchou}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡El desfile de los Chinchou!|The Chinchou parade!}}\n}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP211 |\nprevtitle=Fly Me To The Moon |\nnextcode=EP213 |\nnexttitle=The Corsola Caper |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Johto | }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0212}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|212]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Hideki Sonoda]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded and directed by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Masaaki Iwane]]\n\n[[de:Die große Lampi-Parade]]\n[[es:EP214]]\n[[fr:EP212]]\n[[ja:無印編第212話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第213集]]'}
