It first aired in Japan on October 2, 2008, as a part of a one-hour special with [[DP097]] and in the United States on February 28, 2009.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/11_44-losing-its-lustrous/-->\n<i>Team Galactic has just stolen the Adamant Orb from a transport plane headed to Celestic Town, and their next target could be the Lustrous Orb stored in the town\'s research center. The research center is where Ash and his friends are headed, but they\'re just there to meet Champion Cynthia. She\'s back in town and meeting with her grandmother Carolina, the head of the research center. Cyrus, a well-known businessman with an interest in history, also joins the group to help protect the Lustrous Orb. But when he finds out that Ash and Dawn might have seen the Pokémon known as Lake Guardians, he has Carolina bring them to the Orb itself, which is under guard by a disguised Team Rocket!\n\nAccording to Cyrus, the Lustrous Orb is connected to the dawn of time, but Dawn and Ash don\'t feel anything special when they look at it. Team Galactic chooses this moment to launch their attack, drawing out the security forces with a nearby explosion. They\'ve also taken over the research center\'s security system, so Officer Jenny and our heroes try to escort the Lustrous Orb to a safer place. As they do, Brock\'s Croagunk runs away—it senses Commander Saturn\'s Croagunk and wants to fight.\n\nCommander Saturn himself blocks our heroes\' way, but Cynthia calls out her Garchomp to battle Team Galactic\'s forces and buy the others time to get away. Too late! Another Galactic minion, Commander Mars, surrounds our heroes. Ash and Dawn won\'t let them take the Lustrous Orb without a fight, but things aren\'t looking good. Toxicroak and Croagunk come crashing into the room, and Toxicroak knocks Croagunk out with one hit. Faced with Saturn\'s deadly Toxicroak and the combined forces of Team Galactic, Ash and Dawn might have no choice but to surrender the Orb!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nOn its way from [[Eterna City]] to [[Celestic Town]], a police plane carrying the [[Adamant Orb]] is attacked by a horde of {{p|Golbat}} as well as a {{TP|Saturn|Toxicroak}}. The attack is led by [[Saturn]] of [[Team Galactic]] who notes that everything is going perfectly to plan.\n\nAt the Celestic Town [[Pokémon Center]], {{an|Brock}} and {{an|Dawn}} are preparing to head out while {{Ash}} is perfecting a technique to counter [[Fantina]]\'s {{m|Hypnosis}} based on Dawn\'s [[Contest Battle]] [[DP095|the previous day]]. However, the {{pkmn|training}} is put on hold when news soon breaks that the Adamant Orb was successfully stolen by [[Team Galactic]], and the gang learns that the Adamant Orb was on its way to the [[Celestic Town Historical Research Center]], which is currently studying the Adamant Orb\'s counterpart, the [[Lustrous Orb]]. They also learn that [[Cynthia]] is coming to Celestic Town, and decide to head to the Research Center to see her. Just then [[Nurse Joy]] arrives and Brock begins to hit on her; however, after a few seconds Brock gets the feeling that something is wrong and realizes that {{TP|Brock|Croagunk}} didn\'t stop his misguided romantic attempts, instead choosing to stare out the window, a fact which gives Brock slight alarm. Meanwhile, outside the Pokémon Center, [[Jessie]], [[James]] and {{MTR}} decide to steal the [[Lustrous Orb]] before Team Galactic can.\n\nAt the Research Center, {{ashfr|the gang}} meets up with Cynthia, who introduces them to her grandmother, [[Professor Carolina]], head of the Celestic Town Historical Research Center. On a nearby rooftop, [[Saturn]] recognizes Ash and his friends as the group that [[DP069|interfered]] with their plan to steal the meteorites from [[Veilstone City]], and warns [[Mars]] about them. [[Cyrus]], a world-famous businessman who is responsible for many of the buildings and libraries throughout [[Sinnoh]], approaches the Research Center while Mars and Saturn prepare their attack. As Croagunk once again stares off into space instead of stopping Brock from hitting on Cynthia, Ash and Dawn also take note of Croagunk\'s strange behavior. {{TRT}} disguise themselves as police officers in order to gain entry into the Research Center.\n\nInside the Research Center, Professor Carolina explains the town\'s connection to the [[Legendary Pokémon]] {{p|Dialga}} and {{p|Palkia}}, as well as her own extensive research. Dawn and Ash recognize {{p|Mesprit}} and {{p|Azelf}} from a carving of the {{an|lake guardians}}, and relay [[DP001|their]] [[DP078|experiences]] with the two Pokémon. Cynthia tells the gang that Mesprit represents Emotion and Azelf represents Willpower. Cynthia also tells everyone that there is a third lake guardian at [[Lake Acuity]] near [[Snowpoint City]], {{p|Uxie}} who represents Knowledge. Brock realizes that Uxie is the Pokémon they heard about from {{an|May}} and [[Zoey]] during the [[Wallace Cup]]. Cyrus suggests that Professor Carolina show Ash and Dawn the Lustrous Orb. In the Celestic Ruins, behind the Research Center, Mars\'s gang finishes setting up explosive charges.\n\nTeam Rocket, still in disguise as police officers, relieves the officers guarding the Lustrous Orb, but before they can sneak into the room, [[Officer Jenny]] leads Ash and co. down the hallway. Professor Carolina uses a key card and a palm scanner to open the room with the Lustrous Orb, where both Ash and Dawn examine the item, but feel nothing. This enrages Cyrus, who reveals that the Lustrous Orb may be directly connected to {{p|Arceus|the dawn of time}}. As Cyrus tries to coax more information out of Ash and Dawn, Mars sets off the explosives, causing a panic within the Research Center. Professor Carolina finds that the door to the room with the Lustrous Orb won\'t reseal. The security system of the Research Center is revealed to have been compromised, which leads Cynthia to suggest moving the Lustrous Orb. Ash volunteers to help protect the orb, and Officer Jenny recruits the in-disguise Team Rocket to help, as well.\n\nSaturn and his Toxicroak lead a team of helicopters to the roof of the Research Center. Brock\'s Croagunk releases itself from its {{i|Poké Ball}} and heads down a hallway, causing Brock to chase after it while the rest of the group takes the Lustrous Orb to the main entrance way, where Saturn is waiting. Saturn reveals that his {{p|Bronzor}} has put everyone outside to sleep, while his Toxicroak has taken care of everyone inside. Toxicroak, however, is shown to be in a face-off with Croagunk, and Brock realizes that Croagunk had sensed Toxicroak\'s presence all along.\n\nSaturn tries to use Bronzor\'s {{m|Hypnosis}} attack, but Cynthia sends her {{TP|Cynthia|Garchomp}} out to face it instead and it defeats it easily. As Officer Jenny and the others try to retreat, they find their path blocked by Mars. Just then, Croagunk falls through the skylight and lands hard on the ground. Toxicroak follows and hits Croagunk dead-on with a {{m|Poison Jab}}, knocking it out while Brock watches helplessly on from the roof. Cynthia tells Team Galactic that they\'ll never be allowed to escape with the Lustrous Orb and releases another Pokémon for battle.\n\n==Major events==\n* [[Brock\'s Croagunk]] is revealed to have {{a|Anticipation}} as his [[Ability]].\n* [[Team Galactic]] steals the [[Adamant Orb]].\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} meet [[Cynthia]] again.\n* Ash and his friends meet [[Professor Carolina]] and [[Cyrus]] for the first time.\n* Ash and {{an|Dawn}} learn that the mysterious Pokémon they saw at [[Lake Verity]] and [[Lake Valor]] were {{p|Mesprit}} and {{p|Azelf}}.\n* Ash and his friends encounter [[Mars]], another Team Galactic {{tc|Commander}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* [[Mars]]\n* [[Cyrus]]\n* [[Professor Carolina]]\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Officer Jenny]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* [[Cynthia]]\n* [[Cyrus]]\n* [[Mars]]\n* [[Saturn]]\n* {{si|Rhonda}} (on [[television]])\n* [[Professor Carolina]]\n* {{tc|Galactic Grunt|Team Galactic Grunts}}\n* {{tc|Police Officer}}s\n* Speaker announcer\n* Controller\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Piplup}} ({{OP|Dawn|Piplup}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Staravia}} ({{OP|Ash|Staravia}})\n* {{p|Turtwig}} ({{OP|Ash|Turtwig}})\n* {{p|Chimchar}} ({{OP|Ash|Chimchar}})\n* {{p|Buizel}} ({{OP|Ash|Buizel}})\n* {{p|Gliscor}} ({{OP|Ash|Gliscor}})\n* {{p|Ambipom}} ({{OP|Dawn|Ambipom}})\n*{{p|Croagunk}} ({{OP|Brock|Croagunk}})\n* {{p|Happiny}} ({{OP|Brock|Happiny}})\n* {{p|Garchomp}} ({{OP|Cynthia|Garchomp}})\n* {{p|Toxicroak}} ({{OP|Saturn|Toxicroak}})\n* {{p|Bronzor}} ([[Saturn]]\'s)\n* {{p|Golbat}} ({{tc|Galactic Grunt|Team Galactic Grunts}}\'; multiple)\n* {{p|Delcatty}} ([[Lila]]\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Drifblim}} ({{OP|Fantina|Drifblim}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Stunky}} ([[Officer Jenny]]\'s)\n* {{p|Growlithe}} ({{tc|Police Officer}}\'s)\n* {{p|Azelf}} (fresco and flashback)\n* {{p|Mesprit}} (fresco and flashback)\n* {{p|Uxie}} (fresco)\n* {{p|Dialga}} (portrait and statue)\n* {{p|Palkia}} (portrait and statue)\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[High Touch!]] replaced [[Together|Together2008]] as the [[List of Japanese opening themes|Japanese opening theme]].\n* [[Surely Tomorrow]] replaced [[Message of the Wind]] as the Japanese ending theme.\n* This episode marks exactly 60 episodes since [[Team Galactic]]\'s first {{pkmn|anime}} appearance. In it, however, they hired {{TRT}} to nab the [[Adamant Orb]] from [[Eterna City]]. This time around, the group itself nabbed both it and the [[Lustrous Orb]] from [[Celestic Town]], which lies on the opposite side of [[Mt. Coronet]] and {{rt|211|Sinnoh}} from Eterna.\n* It is revealed in this episode that [[Brock\'s Croagunk]] is able to sense when [[Saturn\'s Toxicroak]] is nearby, possibly an allusion to his {{a|Anticipation}} [[Ability]].\n* This episode marks the first time Brock\'s Croagunk does not stop his {{pkmn|Trainer}} from flirting with a girl.\n* During the title card sequence, the title card music from the {{series|Advanced Generation}} is played instead of the normal music.\n** This did not apply to the dub version.\n* The dub title for this episode is a reference to the phrase "losing its luster".\n* Prior to [[DP097|the next episode]]\'s actual dub title being revealed, [http://schedule.cartoonnetwork.com Cartoon Network] had listed this episode\'s dub title with a "(Part 1)" attached, causing some confusion over the next episode\'s dub title.\n* Team Rocket doesn\'t blast off or recite their {{motto}} in this episode.\n* Music from \'\'[[M09|Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea]]\'\' is used in this episode.\n\n===Errors===\n{{Bad picture|section|Low quality}}\n[[File:DP096 Error.png|frame|right|Slow motion of the error]]\n* During the episode, in a one-second frame, an animation error takes place where [[Officer Jenny]] disappears as {{Ash}} moves in front of her.\n* Croagunk\'s Japanese voice can be heard in one scene.\n* After Team Galactic announces the completion of phase four, [[Cynthia\'s Garchomp]] is nowhere to be seen, despite having been called out of his {{i|Poké Ball}} more than a minute before.\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FCC|bordercolor=99F\n|zh_cmn={{tt|銀河隊來襲！！－前篇－|Team Galactic Attacks!! -Part 1-}}\n|cs={{tt|Třpytivá koule v ohrožení!|Lustrous Orb at Risk}}\n|da={{tt|Tabet af Lustrous Orb|The loss of Lustrous Orb}}\n|de={{tt|Viel Aufregung um den Weiß-Orb!|Much excitement about the Adamant Orb!}}\n|nl={{tt|Glans verliezen!|Losing its Shine!}}\n|fi={{tt|Lustrous-kuulan ryöstö!|Robbery of the Lustrous Orb!}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|L\'Orbe Perlé!|The Lustrous Orb!}}\n|it={{tt|Lo splendore della Splendisfera!|The brightness of the Lustrous Orb!}}\n|ko={{tt|갤럭시단 다시 나타나다!
