It was first broadcast in Japan on January 27, 2000 and in the United States on January 20, 2001. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/03_27-for-crying-out-loud/-->\n<i>Cute and cuddly is one thing, but a bawling Marill is too much even for Misty. When all Misty\'s attempts to toughen up the picayune Pokémon fall short, Team Rocket takes her by surprise. Misty is left with no help or hope in sight, save for little Marill.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{an|Brock}} looks through his guidebook and informs {{Ash}} that they should head to [[Azalea Town]] for the next [[Gym]]. The trio soon stops to admire a scenic lakeside town, where {{an|Brock}} spots a girl at a cliff. {{an|Misty}} also spots a {{p|Marill}} and attempts to {{pkmn2|caught|catch}} it. However, the {{i|Poké Ball}} simply hits Marill on the head, causing it to cry out loud. As Brock comforts the Marill. Ash notices the pink bow on her tail and points out that she must already have a {{pkmn|Trainer}}. Misty tries to hold her, but Marill doesn\'t seem to like her and cries again.\n\n{{TRT}} appears, [[List of Team Rocket\'s disguises|disguised as farmers]], and they offer to give the group a lift. Unaware of the plot, Ash and {{ashfr}} hop on the vehicle. Just then, two hands appear from the hay and grab hold of {{AP|Pikachu}} and Marill. Team Rocket detaches the vehicle\'s tray and flees, leaving Ash, Misty, and Brock behind. Ash and his friends give chase as Team Rocket recites their {{motto}}. Marill lets out an ear-splitting cry, causing {{MTR}} to lose control of the truck and crashes it into a railing, sending Team Rocket blasting off. Pikachu and Marill roll down the hill towards the riverside. Ash tries to go after them but lands on a tree. Brock stays behind and keeps {{TP|Misty|Togepi}} safe, while Misty continues down the hill and grabs the two Pokémon. Unfortunately, she is unable to stop and falls into the river. Ash and Brock watch as Misty, with Pikachu and Marill in hand, is washed downstream.\n\nThe girl Brock was gazing at before suddenly rushes towards him and Ash. She grabs Ash by the shirt and begins shaking him violently, demanding to know where her Marill is. Brock is instantly lovestruck, and introduces himself to her. She replies that her name is [[Wilhomena]]. Elsewhere, Misty, {{AP|Pikachu}}, and Marill wash ashore as Marill begins to cry again. An enraged Misty yells at Marill, causing her to try to run off and inadvertently leave her pink ribbon behind. Misty tries to hold Marill, but it simply refuses to be with her. After calming down, Misty suggests that Marill use its sensitive ears to find its Trainer. During the search, Misty gets impatient with Marill\'s crying. Later on, Ash, Brock, and Wilhomena happen upon the riverside and Togepi spots Marill\'s pink ribbon.\n\nMeanwhile, Marill rushes off after spotting a {{p|Butterfree}}, and follows it to a flower meadow. Marill begins to launch several {{m|Water Gun}} attacks at the Butterfree, but inadvertently stirs up a swarm of {{p|Beedrill}}. Ash, Brock, and Wilhomena hear Pikachu screaming and run towards the sound, but they miss Misty, Pikachu, and Marill. The situation becomes more critical as Misty, Pikachu, and Marill reach a dead end. Thinking quickly, Misty tells Pikachu to use {{m|Thunder Shock}}, which scares off the Beedrill. Afterwards, rain begins to fall, prompting Misty and the two Pokémon to find shelter in a tree hollow, while Ash, Wilhomena, and Brock seek refuge under some trees. The lightning starts scaring Marill, who rushes out of the tree crying, and Misty and Pikachu follow her. Lightning strikes a nearby tree, but Misty grabs Marill just in time to save her. Misty is about to scold Marill for running off again, but realizes that she is relieved to see her safe.\n\nLater, while Misty and the two Pokémon cross a rope bridge, a mechanical hand appears from the trees and begins shaking it. Team Rocket reappears in their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|Meowth balloon]] and grabs the two Pokémon. Misty leaps and manages to grab a hold of Marill. With Misty\'s added weight, Meowth is forced to let go of the claw, sending Misty and Marill into the ravine below. However, [[Ash\'s Chikorita]] uses its vines to save them, and she pulls the pair up to where Ash, Brock, and Wilhomena are standing. Ash then has Chikorita launch a {{m|Razor Leaf}} at Team Rocket\'s balloon. The attack strikes, and the balloon crashes next to Ash and his friends. Pikachu is released and returns to Ash. [[Jessie]] and [[James]] {{pkmn|battle}} Ash and Misty with {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}} and {{TP|James|Weezing}}. Misty calls on {{TP|Misty|Poliwag}} and it repels Weezing\'s {{m|Sludge}}. Then, Arbok\'s {{m|Poison Sting}} almost hits Misty, but Marill uses Water Gun to save her. After that, Pikachu blasts Team Rocket off with {{m|Thunderbolt}}.\n\nAfter reuniting with Marill, Wilhomena is glad to see that she has made some new friends. Ash congratulates Pikachu\'s efforts, but Chikorita interjects and receives most of the praise. Wilhomena offers the group a place to stay at her lake house, but Ash is eager to reach Azalea Town and declines. She thanks the group before driving off in a limousine, leaving both Misty and Brock heartbroken.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

They remain this way until {{TRT}} attacks her on the bridge. (This is most likely due to lighting effects from the storm as her shirt is seen to have a little color still.)\n* When Team Rocket send out {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}} and {{TP|James|Weezing}}, an extra Poké Ball sound effect plays as they throw the Poké Balls, before the sound effect accompanying the Pokémon actually appearing is heard.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[Pokémon Karaokémon]]: [[You & Me & Pokémon]]\n* "Surviving the Storm" from the [[Pokémon The First Movie (score)|score]] of \'\'[[M01|Mewtwo Strikes Back]]\'\' is played when {{an|Misty}}, {{p|Marill}}, and Pikachu are caught in the storm.\n* Instrumentals of [[Misty\'s Song]] and [[Together Forever]] are used as background music.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|bg={{tt|Ревлата|Crybaby}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|愛哭鬼，瑪力露|Crybaby, Marill}}\n|cs={{tt|Uplakané dobrodružství|Tearful adventure}}\n|nl={{tt|Het is om te Janken|For Crying out loud}}\n|de={{tt|Klein, aber oho!|Small, but powerful!}}\n|fi={{tt|Kuka onkaan itkupilli?|Who\'s the crybaby now?}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Mélodrame à chaudes larmes|Melodrama with hot tears}}\n|he=מריל הבכיין{{tt|Marill habachyan|Crying Marill}}\'\'\n|hu={{tt|Kicsi, de hangos|Small but loud}}\n|it={{tt|Pianti e rimpianti|Cryings and regrets}}{{tt|*|Original 2000 dub}} <br> {{tt|Un fiume di lacrime|A river of tears}}{{tt|*|2014 K2 TV dub}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Essa é pra Chorar|That is to Cry}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Um Pokémon Barulhento|A Noisy Pokémon}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡El llanto de Marill!|Marill\'s cry!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Para llorar a gritos|To cry and shout}}\n|sv={{tt|Marill lipsill|Marill crybaby}}\n|pl={{tt|Marill beksa|Marill crybaby}}\n|ro={{tt|Pentru Plânsul Tare|For Crying Out Loud}}\n|hi=रोना बंद करो, Marill {{tt|\'\'Rona band karo, Marill\'\'|Stop Crying, Marill}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n}}\n\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP131 |\nprevtitle=Fighting Flyer with Fire! |\nnextcode=EP133 |\nnexttitle=Tanks a Lot! |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Johto | }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0132}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|132]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Shinzō Fujita]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded and directed by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Masaaki Iwane]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Misty]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Brock]]\n[[Category:Milestone episodes]]\n\n[[de:Klein aber oho!]]\n[[es:EP134]]\n[[fr:EP132]]\n[[it:EP132]]\n[[ja:無印編第132話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第133集]]'}
