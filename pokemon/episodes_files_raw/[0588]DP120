It first aired in Japan on March 26, 2009<!-- and in the United States on *day*-->. Similar to [[DP048]], this episode is a [[clip show]] that summarizes all the events of the ''Diamond & Pearl'' saga up to this episode.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!--This episode is essentially a clip show covering all major events since over this season from ''[[DP001|Following a Maiden's Voyage]]'' to [[DP119]].-->\n{{ashfr|The group}} travels toward [[Snowpoint City]], and along the way, remember what has happened so far in their adventure.\n\nThe clip show is divided into sections, each focusing on a different subject. It starts with an introduction to the [[Pokémon (species)|mysterious creatures]] that inhabit the [[Pokémon world]] and how some of them are able to undergo [[Evolution]]. Then it explains what [[Pokémon Trainer]]s are before covering some moments of {{Ash}}'s {{pkmn|journey}} to become a [[Pokémon Master]] and showcasing {{cat|Ash's Pokémon|his Pokémon}}. After that, a brief explanation of [[Gym]] {{pkmn|battle}}s and [[Badge]]s is given, followed by information on Ash's [[rival]] [[Paul]].\n\nThen two different {{DL|Pokémon Trainer|Trainer class}}es are showcased: {{tc|Pokémon Breeder}}s and [[Pokémon Stylist]]s. After that, the clip show covers the events that have happened since {{an|Dawn}} began her journey as a {{pkmn|Coordinator}}. Her dream of becoming a [[Top Coordinator]] like [[Johanna|her mother]] is addressed, and aspects of [[Pokémon Contest]]s, such as the acquisition of [[Ribbon]]s and the way [[Contest Battle]]s work, are explained. Then {{cat|Dawn's Pokémon}} are showcased, and her rival [[Zoey]] is introduced.\n\nThe clip show then moves to the role [[Team Galactic]] plays in the [[series]] and their interest in [[Sinnoh]]'s space-time legend. It concludes by featuring scenes from future episodes, showcasing Dawn's participation in the {{to|Sandalstraw}} Contest and Ash's battle at the [[Snowpoint Gym]].\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}} (flashback)\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{si|Kenny}} (preview)\n* {{FB|Pyramid King|Brandon}} (preview)\n* [[Johanna]] (flashback)\n* [[Candice]] (preview)\n* [[Maria]] (preview)\n* [[Paul]] (flashback and preview)\n* [[Zoey]] (flashback)\n* {{an|Barry}} (flashback)\n* [[Professor Rowan]] (flashback)\n* [[Professors' aides|Rowan's assistants]] (flashback)\n* [[Roark]] (flashback)\n* [[Gardenia]] (flashback)\n* [[Maylene]] (flashback)\n* [[Crasher Wake]] (flashback)\n* [[Cynthia]] (flashback)\n* [[Reggie]] (flashback)\n* [[Cocoa]] (flashback)\n* [[Fantina]] (flashback)\n* [[Byron]] (flashback)\n* [[Nurse Joy]] (flashback)\n* [[Marnie and Paige|Marnie]] (flashback)\n* [[Marnie and Paige|Paige]] (flashback)\n* [[Officer Jenny]] (flashback)\n* [[Raoul Contesta]] (flashback)\n* [[Mr. Sukizo]] (flashback)\n* [[Saturn]] (flashback)\n* [[Cyrus]] (flashback)\n* {{tc|Galactic Grunt}}s (flashback)\n* {{pkmn|Trainer}}s (flashback)\n* {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s (flashback)\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Piplup}} ({{OP|Dawn|Piplup}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Staravia}} ({{OP|Ash|Staraptor}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Staraptor}} ({{OP|Ash|Staraptor}})\n* {{p|Turtwig}} ({{OP|Ash|Grotle}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Grotle}} ({{OP|Ash|Grotle}})\n* {{p|Chimchar}} ({{OP|Ash|Chimchar}})\n* {{p|Buizel}} ({{OP|Ash|Buizel}})\n* {{p|Gligar}} ({{OP|Ash|Gliscor}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Gliscor}} ({{OP|Ash|Gliscor}})\n* {{p|Buneary}} ({{OP|Dawn|Buneary}})\n* {{p|Pachirisu}} ({{OP|Dawn|Pachirisu}})\n* {{p|Aipom}} ({{OP|Dawn|Ambipom}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Ambipom}} ({{OP|Dawn|Ambipom}})\n* {{p|Swinub}} ({{OP|Dawn|Mamoswine}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Mamoswine}} ({{OP|Dawn|Mamoswine}})\n* {{p|Bonsly}} ({{OP|Brock|Sudowoodo}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Sudowoodo}} ({{OP|Brock|Sudowoodo}})\n* {{p|Croagunk}} ({{OP|Brock|Croagunk}})\n* {{p|Happiny}} ({{OP|Brock|Happiny}})\n* {{p|Hariyama}} ([[Paul]]'s; preview)\n* {{p|Elekid}} ({{OP|Paul|Electabuzz}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Prinplup}} ({{OP|Kenny|Prinplup}}; preview)\n* {{p|Regirock}} ({{DL|Brandon's Legendary titans|Regirock|Brandon's}}; preview)\n* {{p|Registeel}} ({{DL|Brandon's Legendary titans|Registeel|Brandon's}}; preview)\n* {{p|Regice}} ({{DL|Brandon's Legendary titans|Regice|Brandon's}}; preview)\n* {{p|Garchomp}} ({{OP|Cynthia|Garchomp}}; preview)\n* {{p|Bronzong}} ([[Lucian]]'s; preview)\n* {{p|Regigigas}} (preview)\n* {{p|Glameow}} ({{OP|Johanna|Glameow}}; preview)\n* {{p|Medicham}} ([[Candice]]'s; preview)\n* {{p|Sneasel}} ([[Candice]]'s; preview)\n* {{p|Abomasnow}} ([[Candice]]'s; preview)\n* {{p|Empoleon}} ({{OP|Barry|Empoleon}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Ursaring}} ({{OP|Paul|Ursaring}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Budew}} ({{OP|Nando|Roselia}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Roselia}} ({{OP|Nando|Roselia}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Cranidos}} ({{OP|Roark|Rampardos}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Rampardos}} ({{OP|Roark|Rampardos}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Onix}} ([[Roark]]'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Floatzel}} ([[Crasher Wake]]'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Drifblim}} ({{OP|Fantina|Drifblim}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Gengar}} ([[Fantina]]'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Zangoose}} ({{tc|Black Belt}}'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Kangaskhan}} ([[Reggie]]'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Staraptor}} ([[Reggie]]'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Shinx}} ([[Reggie]]'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Mismagius}} ([[Cocoa]]'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Glaceon}} ({{OP|May|Glaceon}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Toxicroak}} ({{OP|Saturn|Toxicroak}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Steelix}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Dialga}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Palkia}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Rotom}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Deoxys}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Cresselia}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Suicune}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Staraptor}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Corphish}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Staravia}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Magikarp}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Mantyke}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Mantine}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Remoraid}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Bidoof}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Bibarel}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Budew}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Kricketot}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Chimecho}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Noctowl}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Hoothoot}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Misdreavus}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Gastly}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Duskull}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Wooper}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Quagsire}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Ludicolo}} (flashback)\n\n==Trivia==\n* The episode was originally believed to be called '''教えて！ポケットモンスター！！''' ''Teach me! {{tt|Pocket Monsters|Pokémon}}!''. Then, it was announced that it was to be a special aired with [[DP119]], and that the episode's title was really '''さびしがりやのユキカブリ！''' ''The Lonely {{tt|Yukikaburi|Snover}}!''. It was then revealed that the former was actually [[DP121]], which was set to air on April 2, 2009, and that this episode's title was changed yet again.\n* This is the anime's third and, to date, last [[clip show]], after [[AG120]] and [[DP048]].\n** The 120th episode of the [[Advanced Generation series|previous series]] was also a clip show.\n* Due to not having a [[Professor Oak's Big Pokémon Examination]] or [[Pokémon Trivia Quiz|similar segment]] following it, this is the shortest episode in over ten years, last matched by [[EP060]].\n* [[Aim to Be a Pokémon Master]], [[By Your Side ~Hikari's Theme~]], and [[Pokémon Symphonic Medley]] are used as background music.\n* This is the final episode to be broadcast in Japan in a 4:3 {{wp|Aspect ratio}}. As of [[DP121|the following episode]], all episodes are shown in a 16:9 aspect ratio.\n** However, {{wp|Cartoon Network}}'s standard-definition feed continued to air the show in a 4:3 aspect ratio for another five episodes after this, not switching to 16:9 until ''[[DP126|Classroom Training!]]''. Cartoon Network would start switching back and forth between 4:3 and 16:9 for standard-definition airings starting [[DP131|five episodes afterward]], before the network stopped its cropping practices during the week prior to the initial dubbed airing of ''[[DP149|Sticking With Who You Know!]]''. High-definition presentations were maintained in all instances.\n{{spoilers}}\n* Several events from future episodes are revealed in this episode, including:\n** {{an|Dawn}} changing clothes from her {{2v2|Diamond|Pearl}} outfit to her {{v2|Platinum}} outfit. ([[DP125]])\n** {{Ash}} and {{an|Brock}} donning jackets similar to the one worn by {{ga|Lucas}} in Platinum. ([[DP125]])\n** [[Candice]]'s debut. ([[DP126]])\n** Ash's [[Gym]] {{pkmn|battle}} against Candice and the Pokémon she will use. ([[DP127]])\n** The return of {{FB|Pyramid King|Brandon}} to awaken {{p|Regigigas}} in the [[Snowpoint Temple]]. ([[DP128]])\n** A battle between Brandon and [[Paul]], with Paul using his new {{p|Hariyama}}. ([[DP128]])\n\n===Dub edits===\n* This episode was skipped in the dub, much like [[AG120]] and [[DP048]].\n\n==In other languages==\nAs most non-Japanese versions of the anime are based on the American dub, this episode has not aired anywhere outside of Japan.\n\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=DP119 |\nprevtitle=Trials and Adulations! |\nnextcode=DP121 |\nnexttitle=The Lonely Snover!|\nseries=Diamond & Pearl series |\ncolorscheme=Sinnoh}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0586}}\n[[Category:Diamond & Pearl series episodes|120]]\n[[Category:Clip episodes]]\n\n[[de:Fushigina Ikimono Pocket Monsters!]]\n[[es:EP589]]\n[[fr:DP120]]\n[[it:DP120]]\n[[ja:DP編第120話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 钻石＆珍珠 总集篇 第2集]]"}
