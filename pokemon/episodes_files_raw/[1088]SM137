It first aired in Japan on September 1, 2019<!-- and is scheduled to air in the United States on *day*-->.\n{{spoilers}}\n<!--\n==Blurb==\nOfficial Blurb from Pokémon.com goes here, with source link-->\n<!--Please do not alter the blurb to fix any errors, they are meant to be presented as they are on the official site.-->\n\n==Plot==\n[[Guzma]] remarks that his victory is still certain, brushing off {{p|Golisopod}}\'s poorly-timed {{a|Emergency Exit}}. He orders Golisopod to use {{m|Poison Jab}}, and it {{status|poison}}s {{AP|Torracat}}. Golisopod follows up with {{m|Throat Chop}}, though Torracat evades it despite being afflicted by the poison. Torracat uses {{m|Fire Fang}} as it latches onto Golisopod\'s arm and engulfs it in flames. Golisopod shakes Torracat off and kicks it away, inflicting a lot of damage and defeating it. [[Nanu]] declares Torracat to be unable to battle, and {{Ash}} recalls it back to its {{i|Poké Ball}} to rest. Guzma is relieved, admitting under his breath that he was beginning to sweat.\n\nGuzma is amused at Ash\'s next choice, {{AP|Pikachu}}, and recalls that Golisopod easily defeated him [[SM115|last time]]. Ash remains confident, declaring that the battle isn\'t over yet. Spurred on by his cheering {{tc|Team Skull Grunt}}s, Guzma boasts that he will win and starts off with Poison Jab, though Pikachu slides between Golisopod\'s legs to evade it. Golisopod counters an oncoming {{m|Iron Tail}} with {{m|Liquidation}} and then slams him to the ground with Throat Chop. [[Hala]] and {{an|Professor Kukui}} realize that Guzma, despite his potential, has not changed at all. [[Plumeria]] privately hopes that Guzma wins for the sake of the many grunts who felt like outcasts before they joined [[Team Skull]].\n\nPikachu is able to continue battling, though Guzma urges Ash to accept his loss and move on. Ash refuses to give up, which irks Guzma, who has Golisopod use {{m|Pin Missile}}. Pikachu protects himself with {{m|Electroweb}} before using {{m|Thunderbolt}}, which Golisopod blocks with its claws. However, Ash predicted this and has Pikachu strike Golisopod\'s legs with Iron Tail, knocking it over, before using Thunderbolt to electrocute it in midair. Guzma becomes increasingly furious and recalls the overwhelming humiliation he felt every time he lost to Kukui during their practice matches. Upon seeing this, Plumeria comes to the realization that Guzma\'s claim of being undefeated is fake. She sees he is very much like his Golisopod, as both hide behind their armor and run away to avoid being hurt. Just then, Ash charges up his [[Z-Ring]] and Pikachu launches {{m|Gigavolt Havoc}}, but Golisopod manages to withstand the [[Z-Move]].\n\nSeeing Golisopod\'s bold strength, Guzma is reinvigorated after reflecting on his past and left even more determined to test his limits. He orders Golisopod to use Pin Missile, which Pikachu evades with {{m|Quick Attack}}. Pikachu strikes back with Iron Tail, though Golisopod counters it using Liquidation. Pikachu fires Electroweb, though Golisopod shreds it with its sharp claws and uses Poison Jab. However, Pikachu evades it and uses Iron Tail, but that attack collides with Liquidation, which defeats Golisopod. Nanu declares Golisopod to be unable to battle and awards the victory to Ash, allowing him to advance to the finals. Ash looks at Guzma, who helps Golisopod up before [[recall]]ing it to its Poké Ball. As Guzma prepares to leave the battlefield, Kukui stops him to say that he will be waiting for him in the next League. Guzma doesn\'t reply and continues walking away. Backstage, Guzma is greeted by Plumeria and his grunts backstage. He announces that the era of "undefeated" Guzma is over and orders everyone to go their separate ways. The grunts, however, are moved to tears, and Plumeria explains they were all inspired by his battle. She then assures Guzma that the grunts still want to follow him, as well as her own loyalty.\n\nThat evening, Ash\'s friends urge him to do his best in his finals match against {{an|Gladion}}. Meanwhile, at the docks, Gladion and his Pokémon stare at the sunset with anticipation. At the [[Manalo Stadium]], Kukui wonders about the outcome of the finals match. Elsewhere, a swarm of {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Melmetal|Meltan}} walk along the seafloor and towards the stadium.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
