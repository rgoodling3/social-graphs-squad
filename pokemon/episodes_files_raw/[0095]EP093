Snowy Mountain Battle!\'\') is the 93rd episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on April 22, 1999 and in the United States on March 11, 2000. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/02_38-navel-maneuvers/-->\n<i>A second Orange Islands trainer puts Ash and his Pokémon through a battery of tests. First, Ash must climb a mountain without use of his Pokémon. Once at the summit, he must assemble the proper team of Pokémon to freeze moving water, construct a bobsled, and then win a race on the sled. Do Ash and his Pokémon have enough skills for the challenge of Orange Island training?</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} spot [[Navel Island]], the home of the second [[Orange League]] [[Gym]] and the {{Badge|Sea Ruby}}. They touch down on the beach near a very quiet village, but the Gym is nowhere to be found. A man approaches on a sailboat, introducing himself as [[Danny]] and immediately appealing to {{an|Misty}}, shocking Ash and {{Tracey}}. Meanwhile, {{TRT}} spots them from their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|Magikarp submarine]]. Misty notes Danny\'s large [[bag|backpack]] and contrasts it to Ash\'s lack of preparation, which begins an argument. Danny notes that they are close, but Misty calls Ash a little kid, which irritates Ash.\n\nThey approach the [[Navel Gym]] gate, and Ash opens it. Inside, there is a cable car and a trail leading up the mountain. {{AP|Pikachu}} points at a sign that explains challengers must climb up the mountain without using {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}, otherwise they risk disqualification, while spectators can use the cable car. Danny also climbs along, moving at a seemingly easy pace while Ash is struggling with both the exertion and a slight fear of heights. At one point, Misty and Tracey pass via the cable car, and Misty calls to Danny. This irritates and distracts Ash, which causes him to slip and fall down. He grabs onto a ledge and attempts to call out {{AP|Bulbasaur}}, but Danny reminds him of the rule. Ash puts the {{i|Poké Ball}} back and manages to climb back up.\n\nAsh takes a rest, exhausted, while Pikachu and Danny enjoy the mountain air. Suddenly, Team Rocket grabs Pikachu with a suction cup and attempts to pull him to their balloon. Ash grabs Pikachu and Danny removes the suction cup, cutting off Team Rocket\'s {{motto}}. They launch another plug, but Danny attaches it to a rock, which flies back and ruptures the balloon, sending it flying into the clouds. The balloon runs into a water geyser, which sends it flying even higher.\n\nAsh and Danny continue hiking up, as the weather turns to snow. Pikachu collapses from the cold and Ash runs to him, taking off his vest and using it to warm Pikachu. At the summit, Misty and Tracey are waiting, wrapped in blankets. When Ash and Danny arrive, Misty runs past Ash to Danny, offering to share her blanket. Danny then reveals to everyone that he is the [[Gym Leader]] since nobody was at the top when Misty and Tracey arrived.\n\nDanny announces that the match is composed of three rounds, and two of three wins. The first test is to freeze a hot water geyser. Danny uses {{p|Nidoqueen}} while Ash summons {{AP|Lapras}}. Both Pokémon fire {{m|Ice Beam}} attacks at the geysers. While Lapras makes steady progress, Nidoqueen is much faster and freezes the geyser first, winning the round. Lapras manages to complete the task but winds up being exhausted.\n\nThe second round is to carve the ice into a sled with three Pokémon. Ash sends out Pikachu, Bulbasaur, and {{AP|Charizard}}, despite its track record of disobedience. Danny uses {{p|Machoke}}, {{p|Scyther}}, and Nidoqueen. Danny\'s team uses brute force to make adequate progress while Charizard loafs around. Bulbasaur\'s {{m|Vine Whip}} and Pikachu\'s {{m|Thunderbolt}} are not as effective, putting them behind while Ash tries to get Charizard to work. Charizard uses {{m|Flamethrower}} on Ash before using four more to perfectly carve the sled and win Ash the round.\n\nThe final round is to race down the mountain to the beach. Danny puts {{p|Geodude}}, {{p|Electrode}}, and Scyther into his sled while Ash rides with Pikachu, Bulbasaur, and {{AP|Squirtle}}. When the light turns green, both teams race down as fast as possible while Misty and Tracey use the cable car. Scyther steers his sled while Ash uses Bulbasaur\'s vines to steer, although Ash spins out of control. Just then, Danny runs into Team Rocket\'s pit trap, and Ash stops to help. Team Rocket reveals themselves, and {{MTR}} activates a larger pit trap that both teams fall into, after which the trio takes Pikachu and tries to escape. Bulbasaur uses its vines to get Ash and Danny out, and the Pokémon create snowballs, with Geodude launching them. Scyther loads Electrode onto a plank as everyone else propels it to the balloon. Pikachu gets clear of the balloon, just as Danny orders Electrode to use {{m|Explosion}} to destroy it. This sends Team Rocket blasting off again.\n\nAsh and Danny restart the race and begin when the sun rises. When the terrain changes from snow to rock, Ash\'s sled picks up too much speed and barely misses a large rock, causing it to cut through trees. Danny closes in on the finish line, but Ash soars through the sky and catches up with Danny. The landing causes Ash\'s sled to shrink in size, and the lighter sled allows Ash to pull forward and win the race. Danny congratulates Ash and hands him the Sea Ruby Badge. Misty and Tracey are glad that Ash won, but Misty is also partially upset that Danny lost. Ash and his friends then get back on Lapras and leave Navel Island.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

In the end, Oak commands Bulbasaur to use {{m|Razor Leaf}}, but instead Bulbasaur wraps Oak up using {{m|Leech Seed}}.\n** Pokémon senryū summary: Bulbasaur; there is no end to the mysteries, {{tt|isn\'t it strange?|It is a pun, as \'\'fushigi da ne\'\' (isn\'t it strange?) is pronounced identically to \'\'Fushigidane\'\' (Bulbasaur).}}\n* An early {{pkmn|anime}} frame from this episode exists.\n* As of this episode, every non-[[Legendary Pokémon]] from [[Generation I]] has appeared in at least one anime episode.\n* When [[Danny]] first appears, he is wearing a Hawaiian-style shirt with a Geodude pattern on it.\n* The book [[The Four-Star Challenge]] is based on this episode.\n* [[Jessie]] and [[James]] are seen eating fish, a [[Animals in the Pokémon world|real animal]], in this episode.\n* This episode\'s title is formatted as \'\'Naval Manoeuvres\'\' on the DVD menu of [[List of English language Adventures in the Orange Islands home video releases (Region 4)|Australian DVDs]].\n\n===Errors===\n* At the very first scene, {{AP|Pikachu}} is standing atop {{AP|Lapras}}\'s head, but in the next scene, he is sitting in front of {{Ash}}.\n* When Ash announces that he is going to use {{AP|Charizard}} for the second part of his [[Gym]] {{pkmn|battle}}, both {{an|Misty}} and {{Tracey}} exclaim, "Not Charizard!" However, this was the first episode that Tracey saw or heard of Charizard. However, he could have seen or heard about it off-screen.\n* According to Tracey, the {{Badge|Sea Ruby}} is so named because it is made from a seashell with a ruby in it, but the gem on the Badge is actually an emerald. It could also be a Green Sapphire, the form of {{wp|Corundum}} that is any color except red, which is classified as Ruby.\n* In the {{pmin|Poland|Polish}} dub, Nidoqueen is called [[Nidoking]] instead.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* Ash and Misty\'s dialogue is slightly changed during her and Tracey\'s ride up in the cable car. Originally, after wishing Danny luck, Misty calls to Ash, "Oh, and while I\'m at it, you be careful too!" Ash gets upset at being mentioned second, causing him to lose his grip. In the dub, Misty only mentions Danny, and Ash complains "What\'s she so worried about \'\'him\'\' for?" before falling.\n* In the Japanese version, Danny gives Misty the nickname "Sumi-chan" when he first meets her, and calls her that throughout the episode. In the dub, he never gives her a nickname.\n* [[Pikachu\'s Jukebox]]: {{so|Viridian City}}\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FFDDAA|bordercolor=FFBB55\n|zh_cmn={{tt|奈普魯道館\u3000雪山之戰|Nàipǔlǔ (Navel) Gym, Snowy Mountain Battle}}\n|cs={{tt|Manévry na Pupkovém ostrově|Maneuvers on Navel Island}}\n|da={{tt|Manøvre på Navel|Maneuver at Navel}}\n|nl={{tt|Navelmanoeuvres|Navel Maneuvers}}\n|de={{tt|Abenteuer auf der Insel Navel|Adventures on Navel Island}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|De la montagne à la mer|From the mountain to the sea}}\n|he=תרגיל ימי {{tt|\'\'Targil Yami\'\'|Navel maneuver}}\n|hi=Navel पार एक्झरसाइज {{tt|\'\'Navel par Exercise\'\'|Exercise on Navel (Island)}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n|hu={{tt|A Limó-manőver|The Limo Maneuver}}\n|it={{tt|Prova di coraggio|Mettle test}}\n|no={{tt|Navel-manøver|Navel maneuver}}\n|pl={{tt|Ostry ślizg|Steep slip}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Manobras Radicais|Cool Maneuvers}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Manobras Navais|Naval Maneuvers}}\n|ro={{tt|Manevre Nautice|Navel Maneuvers}}\n|ru={{tt|Манёвры на острове Нэвил|Maneuvers on Navel Island}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Maniobras en la isla Ombligo!|Maneuvers on Navel Island!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Maniobras en Navel|Manuevers on Navel}}\n|sv={{tt|Duell på Navelön|Duel on Navel Island}}\n}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP092 |\nprevtitle=The Joy of Pokémon |\nnextcode=EP094 |\nnexttitle=Snack Attack |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Orange}} \n{{Project Anime notice}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0093}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|093]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Shinzō Fujita]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Kazu Yokota]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Shigeru Ōmachi]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Yūsaku Takeda]]\n[[Category:Episodes with Gym battles]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which Ash gets a Badge]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Ash]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Misty]]\n\n[[de:Abenteuer auf der Insel Navel]]\n[[es:EP095]]\n[[fr:EP093]]\n[[it:EP093]]\n[[ja:無印編第93話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第94集]]'}
