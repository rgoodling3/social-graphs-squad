Fake {{tt|Satoshi|Ash}} Appears!!\'\') is the 29th episode of the {{series|XY}}, and the 828th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on May 29, 2014 as an hour special alongside [[XY030]], in the United Kingdom on July 6, 2014, and in the United States on August 2, 2014.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/17_28-heroes-friends-and-faux-alike/-->\n<i>In the wake of yet another unsuccessful attempt to grab Pikachu, Team Rocket comes up with a new plan: dress up like Ash, Serena, and Bonnie, then run around town, wreaking havoc everywhere! When the actual Ash, Serena, and Bonnie arrive in town, they learn of the strange goings-on and promise Officer Jenny they will stay out of trouble while she investigates.\n\nMeanwhile, Jessie and James, now disguised as scientists from the Kalos Institute of Technology, have lured Clemont away from the others and coaxed him into helping them with a couple of their robots. The next day, using these Clemont-improved devices (which they\'re calling "Team Rocketronic Gear"), they grab Pikachu and make their getaway—until Clemont introduces a new invention! Team Rocket is sent blasting off again, Pikachu is safely returned, and our heroes resume their journey to Shalour City.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nWhile on their way to [[Shalour City]], {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} have encountered {{TRT}}, who hold {{AP|Pikachu}} captive. [[James]] sends out {{TP|James|Inkay}}, while Ash sends out {{AP|Froakie}} with a {{m|Water Pulse}}. Inkay dodges, while {{an|Clemont}} pulls out a machine. When Inkay uses {{m|Psybeam}} next, Clemont absorbs the move with his machine. James tells it to use {{m|Tackle}} instead, but Inkay is sent back by the machine. Ash tells Froakie to use {{m|Bubble}}, which sends Inkay crashing into a tree. [[Jessie]] commands {{TP|Jessie|Pumpkaboo}} to use {{m|Shadow Ball}} and then {{m|Dark Pulse}}, both of which are absorbed by Clemont\'s machine. Ash and Froakie finish with another Water Pulse, sending Pumpkaboo crashing into James and dropping Pikachu\'s cage and releasing him. With Pikachu back, Ash commands him to use {{m|Thunderbolt}} to send Team Rocket blasting off. Just as the friends thank Clemont for his help, his prototype explodes. Team Rocket lands in the forest, thinking that Clemont\'s device could potentially be useful. Jessie tells the others of a secret plan.\n\nIn a park, a little boy named {{OBP|Myron|XY029}} plays with his {{p|Pancham}} when a stranger introduces himself as Ash from [[Pallet Town]]. "Ash" calls over "{{an|Bonnie}}" and "{{an|Serena}}", who are actually Jessie and {{MTR}} in disguise pretending to be the children, while James plays Ash. Inkay masquerades as Pikachu, causing Myron to question his ability to float in mid-air. James asks for a battle, to which Myron declines, but James goes ahead and tells "Pikachu" to use Psybeam on Pancham. Inkay uses Tackle, which sends Pancham into the ground. Team Rocket runs away, leaving Myron to call [[Officer Jenny]]. Team Rocket runs around town, helping themselves to food without paying. Upon reaching the city, the real Ash and his friends are confronted by Myron, who tells them he has reported them to Officer Jenny. Upon noticing that Ash\'s Pikachu is not floating like the fake Pikachu, he apologizes, saying he mistook them for someone else. At a food cart where Team Rocket stole food, the same thing happens, the owner initially demanding money before noticing that Ash and his friends do indeed look different than the thieves, after the friends tell him they had just arrived in the city.\n\nWhile receiving their healed Pokémon at the [[Pokémon Center]], an announcement calls for Bonnie, Ash, and Serena to come to the front of the Pokémon Center. When they do, Officer Jenny and angry restaurant owners are waiting for them, and Ash once again tells them that they have just arrived in the city, which Officer Jenny and the owners believe. Ash, Serena, and Bonnie get called down for questioning, leaving Clemont alone. Noticing this from around a corner, Team Rocket prepares to enter the second phase of their plan. At the police station, Bonnie, Ash, and Serena are shocked to find out what they have been accused of, and call Clemont back in the Pokémon Center to tell him of the situation.\n\nJessie and James, disguised as scientists, enter and ask Clemont for help on a [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|mecha]], to which he accepts, leaving a note for his friends. At their laboratory, Clemont is impressed by both their tools and their newest {{p|Heliolisk}} mecha. Jessie and James tell Clemont that they would like him to make a defense system against {{t|Electric}} Pokémon, and he agrees, beginning right away. While he works, Team Rocket receives a call from {{an|Giovanni}}, who is satisfied with their progress in the [[Kalos]] region. Clemont has finished the mecha when he notices another faulty device, meant to transport Pokémon, and fixes it for Team Rocket. Clemont comes back to the Pokémon Center, where his friends tell him that fakes disguised as themselves have been running around causing mayhem, and vow to catch the troublemakers. In a field, Team Rocket finishes burying something, excited for the next day\'s events.\n\nThe next day, Team Rocket again eats and runs without paying, knowing that soon Ash and his friends will come to find them. At the shop-keeper\'s directions, the children find and confront their lookalikes in the field, who reveal themselves to be Team Rocket. Team Rocket releases the Heliolisk mecha that Clemont helped build, determined to get Pikachu. James commands the mecha to get Pikachu, who dodges its claws, but whose Thunderbolt and {{m|Electro Ball}} have no effect. Pikachu is hit by the mecha\'s power, and is punted by its claws into Jessie\'s waiting capsule. Jessie puts the capsule into Clemont\'s Pokémon Transportation machine, and Pikachu is transported underground. Meanwhile, the mecha malfunctions, and, being Clemont\'s invention, explodes, sending a successful Team Rocket blasting off.\n\nAsh desperately tries to go after Pikachu, but Clemont says he will take care of it. He uses Serena\'s guidebook to determine radius in which the other end of the Tranportation machine is located. He releases {{TP|Clemont|Bunnelby}}, and commands him to dig underground to find where the transportation device leads. Bunnelby leads them to Team Rocket, who send out Inkay and Pumpkaboo to get rid of the friends. Clemont takes out a new move absorption machine. The machine absorbs Inkay\'s Psybeam and Pumpkaboo\'s Dark Pulse and Shadow Ball. Clemont commands Bunnelby to use {{m|Double Slap}} on Inkay and {{m|Mud Shot}} on Pumpkaboo, which also hits Jessie, causing Pikachu to fly out of her hands. Reunited with Ash, Pikachu uses Electro Ball to send Team Rocket blasting off again. Ash thanks Clemont for saving them. Clemont says it was his fault for building the machine in the first place, but the others tell him he shouldn\'t blame himself because Team Rocket ruined everything. As if on cue, the move absorption machine crackles with electricity and, as always, explodes. With Pikachu back safe and sound, Ash and his friends continue their journey.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

Since {{TRT}} was aware of this while disguised as {{ashfr|the group}}, it is a mystery as to how they learned this.\n* This is the first time that the [[Pokémon Quiz]], or any guessing game segment for that matter, uses a Pokémon in disguise. In this case, [[James\'s Inkay]] was shown disguised as Pikachu, even though Inkay was already featured in [[XY003]].\n* Inkay\'s Pikachu costume can later be seen in a flashback in \'\'[[XY054|Facing the Grand Design!]]\'\', as well as in \'\'[[XY082|A Festival Trade! A Festival Farewell?]]\'\'.\n* This episode was originally scheduled to air alongside [[XY028]], but the latter was pushed up a week after the postponement of [[XY024]], and this one ended up airing alongside [[XY030]].\n* Music from \'\'[[M12|Arceus and the Jewel of Life]]\'\' and \'\'[[M14|Pokémon the Movie: Black—Victini and Reshiram]]\'\' is used in this episode.\n* Team Rocket blasts off three times in this episode. This is possibly because the episode is focused on Team Rocket.\n* This is the second episode in which [[James]] disguised himself as {{Ash}}; the first time was in \'\'[[EP174|Imitation Confrontation]]\'\'.\n* The dub of this episode first aired in {{pmin|the United Kingdom}} on July 6, 2014, 27 days before {{pmin|the United States}} airing. The gap between the Japanese and UK airings is 41 days, making this the shortest time ever between the premiere of the Japanese version and a dub of the same episode, not taking into account the {{series|XY}} sneak peek event.\n* {{Ash}} and [[Korrina]] narrate the preview for the [[XY030|next episode]].\n** There is no next episode preview following this episode, due to it being aired back-to-back with XY030.\n*The dub title of this episode is similar to \'\'[[EP079|Friend and Foe Alike]]\'\'.\n\n===Errors===\n* When [[Jessie]], while impersonating {{an|Serena}}, mocks on how she speaks her eyes are light blue like Serena\'s instead of the usual dark blue.\n* In the {{pmin|Poland|Polish}} dub, when {{TP|James|Inkay}} is reflected by [[Clemontic Gear]], Clemont states that it can also absorb {{type|Psychic}} moves instead of physical moves.\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=F16A81|bordercolor=025DA6\n|zh_cmn={{tt|登登登登！假小智出現！！|Ta-da!
