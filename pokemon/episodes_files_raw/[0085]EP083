It was first broadcast in Japan on February 11, 1999 and in the United States on January 15, 2000.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/02_29-pokeball-peril/-->\n<i>After making a crash landing onto Valencia Island, our heroes get directions to Professor Ivy\'s laboratory where the mysterious Pokéball is being held. Once at the laboratory, Brock realizes that Professor Ivy and her group of scientists are Pokémon breeders just like him! Suddenly Brock begins to feel at home and thinks about staying for awhile to continue his studies on Pokémon breeding.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter the events in [[EP082|the previous episode]], {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} manage to crash-land Team Rocket\'s {{wp|blimp}} on [[Valencia Island]]. They get to an outlook and realize that they cannot find [[Professor Ivy]]\'s lab. {{AP|Pikachu}} points to what appears to be a [[Pokémon Center]]. They go inside and find a [[Nurse Joy]], much like [[Kanto]]\'s Centers, and she gives them the directions to Ivy\'s lab. They get to the lab and go inside, where they are met by [[Professor Ivy\'s assistants|three girls]] who lead the trio down to the beach. There, a {{p|Gyarados}} comes out of the sea as a woman pets it, shocking everyone with her skill. Gyarados takes her to the shore as one of the girls tosses her a lab coat. She introduces herself as Professor Ivy.\n\nBack at the lab, Ivy shows them the gold [[Poké Ball]]. She reveals the inscribed letters on the top of the ball, giving it the name the [[GS Ball]]. One of the assistants demonstrates how the ball could not be transported. Ivy also points out how multiple attempts to open it have all failed. Ivy hands the Ball over to Ash to deliver to {{an|Professor Oak}}. Meanwhile, at the airfield, [[James]] and {{MTR}} are dismayed by the ruined blimp, but [[Jessie]] reminds them that Ash and his friends have a return trip booked. Knowing that it means another shot at catching {{AP|Pikachu}}, {{TRT}} starts repairing the blimp.\n\nIvy leads Ash and the others through the outdoor environment, which serves as an extension of her lab. {{an|Misty}} smells the flowers, but is startled after a {{p|Vileplume}} steps out of the bushes. Ash checks his [[Pokédex]] and notices the Vileplume has {{shiny|differently colored petals}}. The assistants rush out a crate of Pokémon food as other {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} come out, all possessing an unusual orange coloring. Ivy explains that she has bred and raised all of Valencia Island\'s Pokémon, and they form an invaluable part of her research into the effect of the tropical climate\'s effects on Pokémon. Just then, an assistant points out that the {{p|Butterfree}} has not eaten in days despite them offering it different food combinations. Brock samples the food before running off. He returns to smash {{Berries}}, pointing out that the taste is important. He sprinkles the solution onto the food, and the Butterfree flies down immediately to eat, amazing Ivy.\n\nBack at the living quarters, everyone is shocked at the amount of disorder there. Brock promptly puts on his gear and goes into a cleaning frenzy, making the place spotless and preparing dinner, much to the pleasure of Ivy and the assistants. Later that night, while everyone sleeps, Ivy and the assistants watch Vileplume mark the area with its pollen. Brock offers them some rice balls as he watches. An assistant notices a {{p|Raticate}} entering the pollen cloud. Ivy rushes in to pull Raticate to safety, in the process exposing herself to the pollen, which weakens her. She orders the assistants to contact the Pokémon Center. At the Center, Joy treats both Raticate and Ivy. Due to her actions, Raticate was not severely hurt and will recover. The assistants show their concerns for Ivy as Brock watches with admiration.\n\nThe next day, Ash and Misty prepare to leave, but they notice Brock is not with them. They find him fixing the roof with {{cat|Brock\'s Pokémon|his Pokémon}}, and Ivy notes that Brock wants to stay. Brock explains that he can learn about Pokémon at the lab and that they need him more than Ash does. Ash agrees, and he and Misty bid farewell to Brock, Ivy, and her assistants. Later on, Misty notes how different it will be without Brock before bringing up the dilemma about getting back to [[Pallet Town]]. Ash brings out the blimp tickets, but Misty quickly reminds him that the blimp was a sham. When arrive at the airfield, they find a brand-new blimp on standby, and a disguised Team Rocket whisks them aboard. The ship takes to the skies as {{an|Jigglypuff}} manages to get onboard.\n\nWhen Ash and Misty request food, Team Rocket steps out and drops a steel cage to imprison them before revealing themselves. They notice Brock is not with them and tease them about being a couple. Ash orders Pikachu to attack, but Jessie warns that the attack will destroy the entire blimp. Just then, Jigglypuff jumps in and {{m|sing}}s, putting Ash and Misty to sleep. Team Rocket quickly grabs {{wp|parachute}}s and opens the hatch to escape, with Jigglypuff flying out with them. However, Ash and Misty remain caged and asleep on the blimp without a pilot.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

All of the other Pokémon seen have had their regular colors in the [[Orange Archipelago|Orange Islands]]. Even when a {{p|Paras}} and a {{p|Nidorina}} from [[Valencia Island]] appeared in \'\'[[M02|The Power of One]]\'\', they were normal-colored.\n* Near the end of the episode, right before {{AP|Pikachu}} uses {{m|Thunderbolt}} on {{TRT}}, they warn {{Ash}} that the blimp is filled with flammable gas, and if Pikachu used an {{t|Electric}} attack, they would explode. This is most likely a reference to the {{wp|Hindenburg disaster|\'\'Hindenburg\'\' disaster}} of 1937, when a German zeppelin filled with flammable hydrogen gas exploded and crash-landed while attempting to land in New Jersey, killing 36 people. The cause of the explosion was most likely due to a static electricity build-up that had sparked and ignited the gas.\n* The cry of the {{p|Lapras}} in the [[Who\'s That Pokémon?]] segment is different from other Lapras depicted.\n\n===Errors===\n* The title card displays the name for this episode as \'\'Pokéball Peril\'\' instead of \'\'Poké Ball Peril\'\' (incorrectly formatting "Poké Ball"). The title \'\'Pokéball Peril\'\' is also used [https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/02_29-pokeball-peril/ on Pokémon.com].\n** This episode\'s title is formatted as \'\'PokéBall Peril\'\' on the DVD menu of [[List of English language Adventures in the Orange Islands home video releases (Region 4)|Australian DVDs]].\n* This episode, \'\'[[EP081|Pallet Party Panic]]\'\', and \'\'[[EP082|A Scare in the Air]]\'\' use the [[Pokémon Theme]] instead of {{so|Pokémon World}} as the opening in the [[Pokémon in the United States|Kids\' WB!]] and Cartoon Network airings, the [[Netflix]] and [[Pokémon TV]] video-on-demand, and [[List of English language Adventures in the Orange Islands home video releases (Region 4)|Australian DVD releases]]. However, the [[List of English language Adventures in the Orange Islands home video releases (Region 1)|US DVD releases]] use Pokémon World. <!-- Which opening do the foreign-language dubs use? -->\n* When Ash and {{an|Misty}} are walking by themselves after waving goodbye to everybody, Misty\'s ponytail is on the right side instead of the left. When the camera changes to the close up, the ponytail is back on the left.\n* When saying goodbye, {{an|Brock}} has on his apron, but then is shown with his usual green vest seconds later.\n* While on the video phone, Professor Ivy has the receiver and so does {{an|Professor Oak}}, but Ash speaks without it. Ash can obviously hear Professor Oak talking too.\n\n<gallery>\nEP083 title card.png|The title card\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[Pikachu\'s Jukebox]]: [[My Best Friends]]\n* In the dub, James calls Ash and Misty a pair of "very romantic creatures" when Team Rocket captures them. In the Japanese version, he teases them that they had decided to "dump that guy" (Brock) and elope.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FFDDAA|bordercolor=FFBB55\n|zh_cmn={{tt|南國神奇寶貝與GS球|Southern Land Pokémon and the GS Ball}}\n|cs={{tt|Problémy s pokébalem|Problems with a Poké Ball}}\n|da={{tt|Pokéball-alarm|Poké Ball alert}}\n|nl={{tt|Een Poké Ball met Hindernissen|A Poké Ball with obstacles}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Le danger Poké Ball|The Poké Ball peril}}\n|de={{tt|Gefahr im Verzug|Danger in delay}}\n|he=סכנת כדור הפוקימון {{tt|\'\'Sakanat kadur ha\'Pokémon\'\'|Danger of the Poké Ball}}\n|hi=पोके बॉल का खतरा {{tt|Poke ball ka Khatra|Poké Ball Danger}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n|hu={{tt|Pokélabda veszedelem|Poké Ball Peril}}\n|it={{tt|Arrivederci Brock|Goodbye Brock}}\n|no={{tt|Pokéball-fare|Poké Ball Peril}}\n|pl={{tt|Niebezpieczny Pokéball|Dangerous Poké Ball}}\n|pt_br={{tt|A Poké Bola Misteriosa|A Mysterious Poké Ball}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Perigo de Pokébola|Dangerous Poké Ball}}\n|ro={{tt|Pierirea Poké-mingilor|The Peril of the Pokéballs}}\n|ru={{tt|Загадочный покебол|Mysterious Poké Ball}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Peligro Pokébola!|Poké Ball Peril!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Peligro Poké Ball|Poké Ball Peril}}\n|sv={{tt|Ett tropiskt paradis|A tropical paradise}}\n}}\n{{-}}\n\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP082 |\nprevtitle=A Scare in the Air |\nnextcode=EP084 |\nnexttitle=The Lost Lapras |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Orange}} \n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0083}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|083]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Atsuhiro Tomioka]]\n[[Category:Episodes by one-time storyboarders]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Kiyoshi Egami]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Masayuki Fujita]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Brock]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a main character leaves the group]]\n\n[[de:Gefahr im Verzug!
