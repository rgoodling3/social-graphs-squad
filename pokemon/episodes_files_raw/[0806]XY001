The Beginning of Dreams and Adventures!!\'\') is the first episode of the {{series|XY}}, and the 800th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on October 17, 2013, and in the United Kingdom and the United States as a sneak peek preview of the full series on October 19, 2013 to coincide with the worldwide release of [[Pokémon X and Y]]. It was later broadcast in sequence in the United States on January 18, 2014.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/17_01-kalos-where-dreams-and-adventures-begin/-->\n<i>After a quick introduction to Serena, a budding young Trainer who lives with her mother in the Kalos region, we find Ash, Pikachu, and Alexa on a plane, preparing to land in Kalos. Saying that Ash is excited would be quite an understatement! The thought of meeting all the new Pokémon and having lots of exciting Gym battles has our hero beside himself with joyous anticipation.\n\nBut when Alexa discovers that her younger sister (who’s a Gym Leader) isn’t at her Gym in Santalune City, Ash wonders where he should try for his first badge. Alexa directs him to the Gym located in the Prism Tower, right there in Lumiose City! Ash and Pikachu arrive at the Gym, brimming with confidence and energy. But they are greeted by a robot who, upon discovering Ash hasn’t yet won a single badge in Kalos, promptly throws them out with a bang!\n\nOutside, a Trainer named Clemont and his little sister, Bonnie, manage to catch Ash and Pikachu as they come flying out of the tower. After introductions all around, Ash challenges Clemont to a battle on the spot, and he agrees. With Pikachu up against Clemont’s new Pokémon Bunnelby, it proves to be a battle of power and strategy, until it is rudely interrupted by none other than Jessie, James, and Meowth of Team Rocket, who have followed Ash all the way to Kalos!\n\nThe villains proclaim that although Pikachu is their first Pokémon-catching priority, the wealth of prime Pokémon in the Kalos region is too great to ignore! As a new battle begins, Team Rocket’s Wobbuffet proves to be quite a powerful Pokémon, thanks to its Mirror Coat move, which returns special attacks to the sender with double the power! But a Froakie has been observing the events from the sidelines, and now rushes in to help. When it flings the protective Frubbles that cover its back—which isn’t technically a move, and therefore not affected by Wobbuffet’s Mirror Coat—Team Rocket is sent blasting off again, but Froakie is injured in the process. Ash knows they need to get Froakie to a Pokémon Center right away, but Bonnie suggests it would be faster to go to Professor Sycamore’s research lab.\n\nSo off they go: Ash, Pikachu, Clemont, Bonnie, and the injured Froakie, ushering in a new round of adventures and excitement!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode begins as a {{p|Fletchling}} flies into a house. A woman, [[Grace (Kalos)|Grace]], asks Fletchling to wake her daughter {{an|Serena}} up after she failed the first time. Fletchling obediently flies up to Serena\'s bedroom and {{m|peck}}s Grace\'s daughter awake, much to Serena\'s annoyance. Despite the prospect of training with {{p|Rhyhorn}} later for Rhyhorn racing, Serena feels today will be interesting.\n\nMeanwhile, {{Ash}} arrives in the [[Kalos]] region on a plane with [[Alexa]], anticipating a new adventure. As Ash and {{AP|Pikachu}} leave the plane, Ash sees two {{p|Spritzee}} flying above and trips on the steps, landing heavily on the ground. Ash is dismayed to discover that Alexa\'s [[Viola|sister\'s]] Gym is not in [[Lumiose City]], but is in [[Santalune City]] instead. While Alexa makes a phone call to her sister, Ash decides to look around for new Pokémon, when suddenly {{p|Blaziken|a mysterious Pokémon}} appears on the top of the airport traffic control tower and jumps over Ash\'s head. Ash heads to the lobby and runs to Alexa\'s {{p|Helioptile}}, telling Alexa about the amazing Pokémon he saw, to which Alexa promises that he will soon see many more amazing Pokémon. Although Alexa\'s sister is still away from the Santalune Gym, Alexa cheers Ash up by suggesting that he challenge the Gym in Lumiose City instead. Taking him to a map, she explains that Lumiose Gym is housed inside [[Prism Tower]] which is in the centre of the city. Ash gets very excited, and Alexa then tells Ash they\'ll need to go their separate ways now. Ash thanks her for all her help recently, and Alexa in turn thanks him for the fun they\'ve had on their recent travels together. With that, Ash departs and Alexa comments on his energy and wishes him luck in his new adventure. \n\nAfter seeing many Pokémon in Lumiose City, some familiar and some new to him, Ash finds Prism Tower, which houses the Lumiose Gym. Watched by  {{an|Clemont|a boy}} and {{an|Bonnie|his younger sister}}, Ash walks inside and requests a Gym battle, but [[Clembot|a robotic voice]] asks him how many badges he currently has. Unbeknownst to Ash, the Lumiose Gym has a strict requirement that only Trainers with four or more Gym Badges may challenge the Gym Leader. Since Ash has no Badges, Ash and Pikachu are hit with an electric shock and are dropped through a trapdoor to the exit. The two children from before see him falling out of the tower and they attempt to rescue Ash and his Pikachu. The boy throws his [[bag|backpack]] below Ash, which immediately produces a large airbag-like contraption to cushion Ash\'s fall. The little girl catches Pikachu and falls over herself. After the boy helps Ash to his feet, the girl excites herself over how adorable Pikachu is and hugs him tightly, causing Pikachu to shock her in protest. As the scene is occurring, a {{AP|Froakie}} is watching them from a building. Recovering quickly from the shock, the girl apologizes to Pikachu after her brother chides her for not considering Pikachu\'s feelings. Introducing himself to the boy and the girl, Ash tells them how he traveled here from the Kanto region so he could participate in the Kalos League. The three of them head to a Pokémon battlefield in Lumiose City, where the boy and the girl introduce themselves as {{an|Clemont}} and {{an|Bonnie}}. Ash challenges Clemont to a Pokémon battle, to which Clemont accepts after encouragement from Bonnie.\n\nFor their battle, Clemont sends out his {{TP|Clemont|Bunnelby}} and Ash uses Pikachu. Pikachu, like usual for Ash\'s Pokémon battles, starts off with a {{m|Thunderbolt}}, but Bunnelby uses its ears to use the sand to block the attack. Bunnelby responds with {{m|Dig}}, while Ash tells Pikachu to take off and use his speed to confuse Bunnelby. However, Pikachu is unsuccessful and Bunnelby lands its attack. Pikachu and Bunnelby continue trading attacks, while Ash notes that Bunnelby\'s ears are a great asset to it in battle and that Clemont is a skilled Trainer.\n\nJust then, the battle is interrupted when some sort of device is thrown onto the battlefield, which Pikachu narrowly dodges. Looking around, Ash and the others see Team Rocket there, having followed him all the way to Kalos. Although the talking {{MTR}} catches Clemont\'s attention, Ash explains to him and Bonnie how Team Rocket have been following him around, trying to steal Pikachu. Although Pikachu and Bunnelby both put up excellent fights against Team Rocket, [[Jessie]]\'s {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} {{m|Mirror Coat|blocks their attacks}}. Just before Pikachu is struck by a rebounding Electro Ball, the {{p|Froakie}} that had been watching them before jumps in and takes the attack for Pikachu. Using its frubbles as an attack, Froakie incapacitates Wobbuffet and gives Ash, Clemont, Bonnie, Pikachu, and Bunnelby time to escape. However, Froakie is severely injured in the process and Ash rushes it to [[Professor Sycamore]]\'s laboratory, fearing for the little Pokémon\'s safety.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:XY001 Ash VS Clemont.png|thumb|220px|Ash facing Clemont]]\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

The sneak peek versions of these episodes also aired in {{pmin|Canada}} on December 7, 2013.\n** Due to this fact, this episode is tied with the [[XY002|following episode]] as the shortest gap between the airdates of the Japanese version and the English dub. However, both were aired as a sneak preview, not regular episodes, as the {{series|Best Wishes}} hadn\'t completed its run outside Japan yet, so the record that \'\'[[BW134|The Journalist from Another Region!]]\'\' held wasn\'t broken for regular episodes until \'\'[[BW137|Celebrating the Hero\'s Comet!]]\'\'.\n** For these airings, as the [[Pokémon Theme#Opening animation: Dub OP 17|opening theme sequence]] hadn\'t been completed, a placeholder opening was used, in which the show\'s title simply flew into view on a black background as the title card background music played. In the ending credits, a shorter version of Lumiose City\'s {{pkmn|anime}} music was used.\n* This episode marks the first appearance of a number of Pokémon species in the main series after long absences:\n** {{p|Kingdra}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[EP254|Better Eight Than Never]]\'\', 546 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Seaking}} and {{p|Seadra}}, both of whom last appeared in \'\'[[AG110|The Great Eight Fate!]]\'\', 416 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Smeargle}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[DP026|Getting the Pre-Contest Titters!]]\'\', 308 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Weedle}} and {{p|Zigzagoon}}, both of whom last appeared in \'\'[[DP038|One Big Happiny Family!]]\'\', 296 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Lanturn}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[DP078|Pruning a Passel of Pals!]]\'\', 256 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Rhyhorn}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[DP088|Camping It Up!]]\'\', 246 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Chinchou}}, {{p|Horsea}}, and {{p|Tentacool}}, all of whom last appeared in \'\'[[DP089|Up Close and Personable!]]\'\', 245 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Lickitung}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[DP098|If the Scarf Fits, Wear It!]]\'\', 236 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Burmy}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[DP099|A Trainer and Child Reunion!]]\'\', 235 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Wailmer}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[DP109|Leading a Stray!]]\'\', 225 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Luvdisc}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[DP113|Hold the Phione!]]\'\', 221 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Wormadam}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[DP114|Another One Gabites the Dust!]]\'\', 220 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Chatot}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[DP115|Stealing the Conversation!]]\'\', 219 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Bidoof}} and {{p|Flaaffy}}, both of whom last appeared in \'\'[[DP135|Beating the Bustle and Hustle!]]\'\', 199 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Politoed}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[DP139|A Faux Oak Finish!]]\'\', 195 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Goldeen}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[DP140|Historical Mystery Tour!]]\'\', 194 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Sharpedo}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[DP145|A Rivalry to Gible On!]]\'\', 189 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Poliwhirl}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[DP147|Bagged Then Tagged!]]\'\', 187 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Bibarel}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[DP165|Flint Sparks the Fire!]]\'\', 169 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Raichu}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[DP166|The Fleeing Tower of Sunyshore!]]\'\', 168 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Starmie}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[DP171|Dawn of a Royal Day!]]\'\', 163 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Ditto}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[DP173|Dealing With A Fierce Double Ditto Drama!]]\'\', 161 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Blaziken}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[DP174|Last Call — First Round!]]\'\', 160 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Medicham}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[DP175|Opposites Interact!]]\'\', 159 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Drifloon}} and {{p|Hoppip}}, both of whom last appeared in \'\'[[DP176|Coming Full-Festival Circle!]]\'\', 158 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Jigglypuff}} and {{p|Doduo}}, both of whom last appeared in \'\'[[DP182|An Old Family Blend!]]\'\', 152 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Delcatty}}, {{p|Skiploom}}, and {{p|Aipom}}, all of whom last appeared in \'\'[[DP183|League Unleashed!]]\'\', 151 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Pichu}} and {{p|Tentacruel}}, both of whom last appeared in \'\'[[DP190|The Brockster Is In!]]\'\', 144 episodes ago.\n* A new eyecatch debuts in the Japanese version, called [[Pokémon Quiz]]. The silhouette of the Pokémon is revealed, then four other silhouettes appear alongside it: one being identical to the first silhouette, two being that of similar Pokémon species and one of them being that of {{TRT}}. The viewers have to remember where the correct silhouette was, which is revealed alongside the actual Pokémon species after the commercial break.\n* This is the first time that an episode introducing a new [[core series]] region does not feature the regional {{pkmn|Professor}}.\n* This is the first time that Ash\'s male traveling companion appears in the first episode of a new series.\n* This is the first episode to use music from \'\'[[M15|Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice]]\'\'.\n* Jessie [[Breaking the fourth wall|breaks the fourth wall]] when Ash says that he and Pikachu will always stand up to Team Rocket. She replies that all he will end up with is reruns, implying that the show will end due to them succeeding in capturing Pikachu.\n\n===Errors===\n* In the opening scene of the English dub, when Grace says "usual" microphone static can be heard.\n* Serena\'s {{p|Bulbasaur}} doll moves farther away from her bed between shots.\n* In the intro segment of the episode, a {{p|Dedenne}}\'s belly is colored the same as the rest of its body.\n* At two different times, the sound of {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}}\'s Poké Ball opening is heard despite already being out of it.\n* After [[Alexa]] finished her call with her sister, {{Ash}}, {{AP|Pikachu}}, and {{p|Helioptile}} go to her to tell her Ash saw an awesome Pokémon, and Alexa is missing her one earring.\n* In one scene, the pocket on Alexa\'s jeans is missing.\n* During the {{motto|Team Rocket motto}} sequence:\n** The space inside the "R" on Jessie\'s uniform is briefly colored red instead of white, and a few frames later, her undershirt is miscolored white. This error is present in every subsequent episode featuring the same motto animation.\n** When James\'s crosses his arms, the fingers on his left glove are colored like his skin, instead of black. This is corrected in subsequent episodes.\n* In the dub, when Ash asks Clemont where the Pokémon Center is, his mouth doesn\'t keep up with the words.\n<gallery>\nFile:XY001 error.png|Alexa\'s missing one earring\nFile:XY001 error 2.png|Alexa\'s missing jeans pocket\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n* For unknown reasons, the title card is lacking the characters\' shadows and the \'\'To Be Continued\'\' text does not appear in the end of the episode in the {{pmin|the United States|American version}}. The {{pmin|the United Kingdom|UK version}}, and presumably all international versions, has the \'\'To Be Continued\'\' added in, while US [[iTunes]] release adds the characters\' shadows along with the \'\'To Be Continued\'\'.\n* In the official debut of this episode\'s dub, a large portion of the original music is replaced with dub music. However, this was not the case in the preview airing, in which the episode used all of the original music.\n** In addition, several lines of dialogue were rerecorded and the [[Clembot]]\'s voice was changed between the preview and official debut to be consistent with later episodes.\n* For unknown reasons, the title card segment was skipped in the Hindi dub. It will be doing so regularly from this point on.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=F16A81|bordercolor=025DA6\n|zh_cmn={{tt|抵達卡洛斯地方！夢想與冒險的開始！！|Arrival in Kalos region!
