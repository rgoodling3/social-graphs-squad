It first aired in Japan on August 17, 2017 and in the United States on November 4, 2017.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/20_38-mimikyu-unmasked/-->\n<i>When Team Rocket pounces, Ash is excited to show off his new Z-Move, but Lycanroc can’t quite make it work. After Kiawe steps up to send the villains blasting off again, Jessie and Mimikyu land in a shopping mall—and Mimikyu’s disguise is torn!\n\nJessie thinks this is the perfect opportunity to get Mimikyu a new outfit, but it just isn’t interested in changing its look. She finally agrees to mend the ripped cloth, and when they battle again, Mimikyu actually listens to Jessie’s commands! Unfortunately for them, Lycanroc has been training hard, and it performs a perfect Z-Move that sends them blasting back to Bewear!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing their trip to [[Akala Island]], {{Ash}} arrives at school, keen to try out the {{type|Rock}} [[Z-Move]]. He is soon joined by {{an|Kiawe}} and {{an|Mallow}}, only for {{AP|Pikachu}} to be captured by {{TRT}}. Not pleased by their actions, Ash gets ready to battle with {{AP|Lycanroc}}. Team Rocket notices how different it looks as [[Jessie]] sends out {{TP|Jessie|Mimikyu}}. As Mimikyu turns its attention to Pikachu, Ash and Lycanroc perform {{m|Continental Crush}}, only for the move to fail. Kiawe sends out {{TP|Kiawe|Turtonator}} to use {{m|Inferno Overdrive}}, which frees Pikachu and sends Team Rocket blasting off. As the trio goes flying, they notice that {{an|Bewear}} hasn\'t arrived to save them as they fall in different directions. Jessie and Mimikyu land in town after bouncing off a {{p|Pikachu}} balloon.\n\nAs Jessie looks around for the others, Mimikyu emerges from a bush, but its disguise has been torn. Jessie remembers what {{MTR}} said about seeing Mimikyu\'s true form and tries to recall it into its [[Luxury Ball]], but Mimikyu doesn\'t go back in. Jessie isn\'t pleased by this, but she cheers up when she sees a [[malasada]] stand. She buys two, but before she can eat any, three {{p|Murkrow}} swoop in and take the malasada. Upon realizing this, Jessie uses the empty bag as a disguise for Mimikyu, but they are unsatisfied by the end result. Meanwhile, in the forest, [[James]], Meowth, and {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} are searching for Jessie. When Meowth recalls seeing a shopping mall, James realizes that Jessie may have landed there. Fearful that she could spend all of their money there, they run off to find her. In a clothing shop, two workers are helping Jessie as she tries to find Mimikyu something to wear. However, the unimpressed Mimikyu attacks Jessie before running away.\n\nBack at the [[Pokémon School]], Ash and Lycanroc continue to attempt Continental Crush with no success. His classmates watch on with support as they try to figure out why it isn\'t working as each suggestion isn\'t the case. {{an|Professor Kukui}} suggests that it may not be working because of the power received after evolving and Lycanroc lacks the experience to control the power. They agree to go back to basics as Professor Kukui amends the lesson to work on their moves and they start their training. Back at the shopping mall, Jessie is exhausted but as she goes to buy more malasadas, she finds she has little money left so buys just one. Whilst Jessie is busy, Mimikyu becomes angry and goes to attack the Pikachu balloon only for Jessie to stop it. Jessie offers to fix Mimikyu\'s disguise and Mimikyu hands it back to Jessie. Back at the school, using {{m|Rock Throw}} against Turtonator leaves Lycanroc looking tired as {{an|Lana}} has {{TP|Lana|Popplio}} test its {{m|Aqua Jet}} to allow {{TP|Mallow|Steenee}} to water-ski.\n\nAt the shopping mall, Jessie has sewn Mimikyu\'s disguise back together and as she goes to share her malasada, the Murkrow attack and take the malasada and disguise. Jessie and Mimikyu chase after the Murkrow and Jessie climbs up a tree to get the malasada and disguise back. After getting the malasada back, she chases a Murkrow for the disguise and jumps into the air and grabs it. A tired James and Meowth approach the shopping mall as an explosion happens nearby and guessing that Jessie maybe involved, rush in the direction of the smoke. They arrive in the shopping mall where the Pikachu balloon has burst as Jessie emerges from the remains and gives Mimikyu the disguise back and splits the malasada in half. The Murkrow return, this time en mass as Mimikyu rips through the malasada bag which shields Jessie and James\' eyes and returns to its disguise, causing Meowth to see its true form once again.\n\nMeowth finds himself walking along the tunnel and emerges into a bright field of flowers and enjoys himself. Back in the real world, Mimikyu prepares to attack the Murkrow as James sees Meowth lying on the floor. The Murkrow attack which Mimikyu dodges before obeying Jessie\'s orders to attack as the Murkrow flee in defeat. James draws Jessie\'s attention over to Meowth who is dreaming about being on {{an|Giovanni}}\'s lap before coming back round as Jessie decides to attack Ash. Back at the school, Ash is surprised to see Jessie back as James and Meowth watch from a distance. Ash decides to show Team Rocket how hard they\'ve been training as Mimikyu is able to dodge Rock Throw but instead of attacking Lycanroc, Mimikyu attacks Pikachu.\n\nJessie tells Mimikyu to focus on Lycanroc only for Ash and Lycanroc to perform Continental Crush which succeeds, sending Team Rocket flying before Bewear jumps up to save them. Back at Bewear\'s den, Team Rocket help themselves to some berries.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
