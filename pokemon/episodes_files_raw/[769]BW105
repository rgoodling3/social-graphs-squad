It first aired in Japan on December 6, 2012 and in the United States on March 23, 2013.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/16_08-lost-at-the-league/-->\n<i>As the second round of the Unova League comes to a close, Ash, Cameron, Stephan, and Virgil have all won their battles to advance to round three! While everyone discusses how to spend the evening—watching a fireworks show, browsing the many vendors on site, or relaxing in the sauna—Axew wanders off and is quickly lost in the crowd.\n\nWhile trying to find its way back to Iris, Axew gets swept up in the celebration of a small-town fan club! They’re in Vertress City to support Russet, the first Trainer from their hometown to make it into the top 16 of the Unova League.\n\nMeanwhile, our heroes have realized Axew is missing, and Virgil suggests checking the surveillance cameras. They rush out into the city to look for Axew, but the crowds are just too big. They decide to split up to cover more ground, and Pikachu, Oshawott, Scraggy, and Emolga team up to search. While out on the hunt, Oshawott spots a big box of apples and happily digs in—not realizing that the food belonged to a Garbodor and a group of Trubbish, who angrily set out to find the thief!\n\nEmolga finally spots Axew—but the angry Poison types are closing in, and they confront our heroes’ Pokémon at the edge of a tall cliff! Ash and the others hear the commotion and come to investigate. Everyone is reunited, and Ash tries to apologize to Garbodor for Oshawott’s behavior, but it ignores him and attacks!\n\nVirgil puts his Pokémon Rescue Squad skills into action, first using Espeon\'s Psychic to get everyone out of the way, then bringing out a Soothe Bell to calm Garbodor down. Once the battle is averted, Cilan makes amends by preparing a delicious dinner for Garbodor and the Trubbish, including his special-recipe Pokémon food, and everyone settles in to watch the fireworks together.\n\nThe third round of the Unova League begins the next morning, and the first match is Ash versus Stephan! Stephan is battling with his new Liepard, and Ash calls out his first Pokémon...but which one? Find out next time!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAt the [[Vertress Conference]], {{Ash}} battles a Trainer with his {{AP|Scraggy}}. Scraggy defeats the opponent\'s {{p|Darumaka}} using {{m|Headbutt}}, leaving Ash to proceed to the last 16 Trainers. The battles of Ash\'s rivals are then shown. [[Stephan\'s Sawk]] defeats a {{p|Gurdurr}} and [[Stephan]] wins. {{un|Cameron}} wins with his {{p|Ferrothorn}} against an {{p|Amoonguss}} and [[Virgil]] wins with his {{p|Glaceon}} against a {{p|Reuniclus}}. Afterwards, the central screen shows the match-ups for the last 16. Much to Ash\'s shock, he finds out he has to battle Stephan.\n\nAfter the second round, the Trainers begin to rest for tomorrow. As {{an|Cilan}}, {{an|Iris}}, and {{an|Bianca}} walk through town, Bianca immediately realizes that there\'s an ice cream stand selling {{DL|Status condition healing item|Casteliacone}}s and goes ahead to buy some. {{TP|Iris|Axew}} suddenly notices a balloon floating by and runs after it. Meanwhile, Ash and Stephan are arguing who will win their battle. Cameron becomes excited because there will be fireworks that night, and he and {{TP|Cameron|Riolu}} run off to set up a tent in the open air to enjoy the fireworks to the fullest. Stephan tells Ash that he will show him how strong he really is and walks off. Ash then meets up with Cilan and Iris, and {{AP|Pikachu}} notices that Axew is gone.\n\nAt that same moment, Axew still chases the balloon but finds it has flown away. He then realizes he got lost and because there are so many people, he can\'t see where Iris and the others are. Axew then sees a bunch of people celebrating for [[Russet]], a participant of the Vertress Conference, for making it through the first few rounds. As Russet\'s celebrating squad walks by, Axew follows and [[Okura|an old lady]] of the squad notices Axew and grabs him. Meanwhile, Ash, Iris, and Cilan are still searching for Axew. \n\nAxew becomes dizzy because the woman that has taken him away runs at a fast pace. At the Vertress Stadium, Ash and his friends are searching for Axew using the surveillance camera system. Suddenly, Iris sees a recording where Axew is taken by the arm by an old woman. In the city, Bianca is eating a Casteliacone. She notices Axew walking all alone with a costume on. Axew tries to reach Bianca, but is taken away by Russet and his supporters once again. Meanwhile, Cameron and Riolu are setting up their tent near a lake. Their camp is accidentally destroyed by Russet and his supporters, however. Ash, Iris, Cilan, and Virgil, meanwhile, are still in search for Axew. They meet up with Bianca and she wants to give them Casteliacones, but accidentally knocks Ash away in the water. Bianca then tells them that she has seen Axew. The group decides to use their Pokémon to search for Axew. Ash sends out Pikachu, {{AP|Oshawott}}, and Scraggy while Iris sends out {{TP|Iris|Emolga}}. At that same moment, Axew and Russet and his family and friends are picnicking and the group celebrates the fact that Russet made it to the last 16. Axew notices a girl giving her {{p|Lillipup}} food, which reminds him of Iris.\n\nMeanwhile, Pikachu, Scraggy, Oshawott, and Emolga are still in search of Axew. Whilst Pikachu and Scraggy ask a {{p|Stoutland}} for help, Oshawott notices a bunch of apples given to some wild {{p|Trubbish}} by a shopkeeper. The group of Trubbish notice Oshawott coming and hide. Oshawott then proceeds to eat all of the apples. Emolga and a wild {{p|Swoobat}} manage to find where Axew went. As the Pokémon prepare to leave, the shopkeeper that gave the apples to Trubbish notices that Oshawott ate all the apples and that Oshawott got overweight. Elsewhere, Axew runs away from the group of supporters to find Iris. At that moment, the Trubbish realize that Oshawott ate all of their apples and begin to cry, and a {{p|Garbodor}} appears, consoling them. It and the Trubbish then head on their way to search for Oshawott. Meanwhile, Cameron and Riolu manage to repair their camping spot. Iris and the others come by and find the hat that Axew wore earlier and continue to search, destroying Cameron\'s camp once again. Somewhere else, in a forest, Axew cries because he is lost. But Pikachu and the other Pokémon manage to find him and they reunite. The Garbodor and Trubbish arrive, however, having come to get revenge against Oshawott for eating all the apples.\n\nElsewhere, Bianca and Virgil are still in search of Axew and the other Pokémon. They meet the woman who gave the wild Trubbish behind her store the apples that Oshawott eventually ate. She explains that there was a stuffed Oshawott with a Pikachu and Emolga and she leads Bianca and Virgil in the direction they went. At the forest near Vertress City, Axew and the other Pokémon run away from the angry Garbodor and Trubbish. Pikachu tries to ask them why they\'re doing this, but Garbodor responds by attacking them with {{m|Gunk Shot}}. Pikachu and the others end up at a cliff with only a deep abyss beneath them. Meanwhile, in the forest, Iris, Ash, and Cilan find another piece of cloth Axew wore earlier. Then they suddenly hear a group of Pokémon screaming, which they recognize as the screams of their own Pokémon. At the cliff, Oshawott tries to reason with Garbodor, but Garbodor reveals to Pikachu, Emolga, and Axew that Oshawott ate all of the apples that were meant for the Trubbish. Oshawott tries to apologize, but Garbodor ignores him and attacks once more using Gunk Shot. Oshawott quickly protects himself using his scalchop. Suddenly, Ash, Iris, and Cilan arrive at the scene. But Garbodor once again attacks the group of Pokémon with Gunk Shot and sends them falling off the cliff. Then, out of nowhere, they are saved by Virgil\'s {{p|Espeon}} using {{m|Psychic}}. After Virgil and Bianca inform Ash and co. that Garbodor and Trubbish are attacking Oshawott because he ate their apples, Ash tries to stop Garbodor and tells it they\'re sorry for this incident. However, Garbodor doesn\'t accept the apologies and attacks them once more with Gunk Shot. Virgil stops the attack in time using his {{p|Umbreon}}\'s {{m|Shadow Ball}} and then uses a [[Soothe Bell]] to calm Garbodor down.\n\nBack at Vertress City, Ash and co. bring a large supply of food to Garbodor and the Trubbish and have Oshawott apologize. At that moment, the fireworks show starts at Vertress City and everyone in town is watching. Ash, Iris, and Cilan arrive at the lake near the city where Russet and his family and supporters are. The old lady who took Axew with her earlier notices that Axew got reunited with his Trainer.\n\nThe next day, the Vertress Conference continues and the first battle is Ash against Stephan. Stephan sends out {{p|Liepard}}, which Ash scans on his [[Pokédex]]. Ash is then about to send out his Pokémon as the episode ends.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
