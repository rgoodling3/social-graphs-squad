Watch as Casey\'s Chikorita evolves in order to help save Ash and Pikachu from Team Rocket\'s grasp!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nOn their way to [[Ecruteak City]], {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} stumble across a [[Bug-Catching Contest]]. They learn from the event announcer the rules of the contest. Each participant is given a special [[Sport Ball|Park Ball]]. They are to enter the [[National Park]] and, using only one {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}, catch the strongest {{type|Bug}} Pokémon they can find. Whoever gets the strongest one wins the competition and, in addition to keeping the Pokémon they catch, they also win a [[Sun Stone]]. While {{an|Misty}} isn\'t too keen, Ash decides to enter the contest to get a new Pokémon. While registering, he encounters {{an|Casey}}, who tells him that she is entering the contest as well, and that she intends to beat Ash no matter what the cost.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Jessie]] and [[James]] are also trying to enter the contest but are unable to register, due to the contest\'s rule that forbids anybody over the age of 16 from entering. Instead, Jessie, James, and {{MTR}} [[List of Team Rocket\'s disguises|dress up]] as students and a baby, respectively, but the disguises don\'t convince the entrance employee. As a result, the trio kidnaps the contest employee.\n\nThe competitors are informed of the rules and each receives a Park Ball. A crowd, including {{an|Brock}} and Misty, watch the contest unfold on a screen in an amphitheater. Ash quickly spots a {{p|Weedle}}. He orders {{AP|Pikachu}} to attack it, but before he can engage it Casey appears and attacks it with her {{p|Chikorita}}. She easily catches it and continues on her way, ignoring Ash\'s protest that he saw it first.\n\nIn another part of the forest, {{TRT}} attempts to use their stolen Venomoth costume to attract Pokémon. Jessie succeeds in luring a {{pkmn2|wild}} Venomoth towards her, but gets hit with {{m|Stun Spore}} when the {{t|Bug}} Pokémon realizes she\'s a fake. As they recover from the attack James and Meowth decide to try a different plan.\n\nMeanwhile, Casey orders Chikorita to start attacking trees and manages to knock some wild {{p|Pineco}} out of their hiding spots. After a short battle, Chikorita manages to defeat them and the two continue on their way. Watching from the amphitheater Misty and Brock comment on her momentum. However, Misty\'s attention is taken away from the contest when several Bug Pokémon appear nearby.\n\nBack in the forest, Casey notices Chikorita lagging behind, still tired from its previous {{pkmn|battle}}s. Still wanting to win she tells it not to give up, and the pair continues their hunt. They soon encounter a rare {{p|Scyther}}. Despite Chikorita\'s obvious exhaustion Casey orders it to attack and the tired Pokémon soon finds itself in a battle it can\'t win. At the last moment, Ash appears with Pikachu and saves Chikorita. He yells at Casey for being an irresponsible Trainer then lures the Scyther away so that she and Chikorita can rest. Not wanting to listen to him, Casey tries to encourage Chikorita, only to realize that it has run away. Misty\'s {{TP|Misty|Togepi}} wanders into the forest and finds Chikorita hiding in a bush, and tries to cheer it up. Misty and Brock soon appear looking for it and Casey stumbles upon them a moment later. She calls Chikorita over to her but is surprised to find that it refuses to listen to her. Misty tells her it\'s because she\'d ignored Chikorita\'s feelings, and made it fight until it collapsed. Realizing her mistake Casey tearfully apologizes to Chikorita, who joyfully jumps into her arms.\n\nMeanwhile, Ash and Pikachu continue their pursuit of the Scyther. Following it through a bush they accidentally disturb a small swarm of {{p|Beedrill}} who swoop down to attack them. Taking advantage of the opportunity Ash orders Pikachu to drive them off with {{m|Thunderbolt}}, and easily catches one of the shocked {{TP|Casey|Beedrill}}. The two begin to celebrate but suddenly fall into one of Team Rocket\'s infamous pit traps. The pit drops them into an insulated cage, and the pair are quickly lifted off by [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|Team Rocket\'s hot air balloon]].\n\nMisty, Brock, and Casey come running to help Ash and Pikachu. Casey orders Chikorita to use {{m|Razor Leaf}} but finds that it\'s too weak to damage the balloon or free Ash. Taunting the people on the ground, Meowth pulls out a large rocket and prepares to fire it at them. In response to this new threat Casey\'s Chikorita suddenly [[Evolution|evolves]] into a {{TP|Casey|Bayleef}} and easily deflects Meowth\'s attack. Using Razor Leaf again, Bayleef is able to free Ash and Pikachu who quickly send Team Rocket blasting off with a {{m|Thunderbolt}}.\n\nWith the Beedrill he caught Ash wins the contest, earning him a Sun Stone as well allowing him to keep Beedrill. Ash, however, decides to give his Beedrill away to Casey, as thanks for her help against Team Rocket and also because of her obsession with black and yellow-striped Pokémon. She tearfully accepts his gift and happily sings the {{p|Electabuzz}} Fight song before parting ways with Misty, Brock, and him again.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

This is similar to the alteration in design of the [[Safari Ball]], which appears differently between [[EP035|its anime debut]] and its [[Generation III]] reintroduction with an in-game sprite.\n* Both [[Jessie]] and [[James]] are over 16 years old, at least in the dub. This is one of the few times the {{pkmn|anime}} has mentioned their ages.\n** According on to the Japanese version \'\'[[M02|The Power of One]]\'\', they are both 25 years old, which fits this criteria.\n* In the Japanese version, the Pokémon featured in the episode\'s [[Who\'s That Pokémon?|Dare Da?]] (Who\'s this?) segment is Jessie in the {{p|Venomoth}} suit. When the "Pokémon" is revealed, the narrator calls it a Venomoth, but the kids then shout, "Incorrect!"\n** It should be noted that this is the second time the [[Who\'s That Pokémon?|Dare Da?]] (Who\'s This?) Pokémon segment had a human appearing as a "Pokémon", with [[Brutella]] having earlier appeared in [[EP018]].\n* This episode\'s English title, much like a [[DP087|future episode]], is a reference to the famous saying "{{wp|the buck stops here}}".\n* This episode marks the second time {{Ash}} tries (and fails) to catch a {{p|Weedle}}, the first being \'\'[[EP004|Challenge of the Samurai]]\'\'. However, he eventually catches its final form, {{p|Beedrill}}.\n* Ash receiving a [[Sun Stone]] is a reference to the games, where the {{player}} gets a Sun Stone if they win the first place in the [[Bug-Catching Contest]].\n* The book [[Winner Takes All]] is based on this episode.\n* {{an|Misty}} is scared of every single {{t|Bug}} Pokémon in the episode and reacts to them by hiding or shooing them away. The only Bug-type Pokémon she doesn\'t react to was {{p|Pineco}}; she even asks Brock if Pineco are Bug-type Pokémon or not.\n* Casey telling her {{p|Chikorita}} to knock the tree down is a reference to the games, where the player can {{m|Headbutt}} trees to find wild Pokémon.\n* While saying her last line in the {{motto}}, Jessie holds a bag with a [[Animals in the Pokémon world|fish]] in it.\n* After Casey\'s Chikorita evolves into {{p|Bayleef}}, its headband appears to have disappeared.\n* This is the only episode in which Ash gives a Pokémon to another {{pkmn|Trainer}}.\n* Casey saying "Speed and charge" in the Japanese version soon after catching a Weedle is the same slogan which former Baseball manager of the {{wp|Yomiuri Giants}}, {{wp|Shigeo Nagashima}} used.\n* Casey telling her Chikorita to "Show the power of the machine gun battling line!" is a reference to the "Machine Gun Offense" used by the {{wp|Yokohama DeNA BayStars}}, during their \'98 season.\n\n===Errors===\n* In one scene, Misty\'s {{DL|List of clothing in the anime|Misty|shoes}} are colored all white.\n* When Misty is complaining about Bug-type Pokémon, Togepi moves its mouth, but it doesn\'t say anything.\n* When Ash was given {{AP|Beedrill}} after the contest had ended, he already had {{AP|Pikachu}}, {{AP|Bulbasaur}}, {{AP|Chikorita}}, {{AP|Cyndaquil}}, {{AP|Totodile}}, and {{AP|Noctowl}} on his team, so Beedrill should have been sent to {{an|Professor Oak}}. However, Beedrill remained on Ash\'s team until he gave it to Casey.\n* Despite Ash catching Beedrill in a Park Ball, it is shown to be contained in a regular {{i|Poké Ball}} after the contest ends.\n* The blurb for this episode is repeated twice.\n* In the {{pmin|Poland|Polish}} dub, Casey tells Chikorita to attack the Pineco tree with {{m|Razor Leaf}} instead of {{m|Tackle}}.\n** Also, during the battle with Team Rocket, Casey tells Chikorita to use Tackle instead of Razor Leaf.\n** Throughout the episode, the Park Ball is simply referred to as a Poké Ball.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* In the original, the rules stated that people over eighteen were not allowed to enter, while the in the dub, it was sixteen.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|bg={{tt|Насекомото спира тук|Insect stops here}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|捕蟲大會，在自然公園收服他！|Bug Catching Tournament, Capture it at Natural Park!}}\n|cs={{tt|Hmyzí zastávka|Bug stop}}\n|de={{tt|Fang das Käfer-Pokémon!|Catch the bug-Pokémon!}}\n|nl={{tt|Een Feesie Om Een Beesie|A Party for a Bug}}\n|fi={{tt|Hyönteiselämää|Insect life}}\n|fr={{tt|Le concours|The contest}}\n|he=תחרות פוקימוני החרק \'\'{{tt|tacharut Pokémonei hacherek|The Bug Pokémon Contest}}\'\'\'\n|it={{tt|Caccia ai Coleotteri|Hunting Bugs}}\n|pt_br={{tt|O Bicho vai Pegar|The Bug will Bug}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|O Insecto Pára Aqui|The Bug Stops Here}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Atrapen un insecto!|Catch a bug!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Concurso de Pokémon bicho|Bug Pokémon contest}}\n|sv={{tt|En Bayleef, tack|One Bayleef, please}}\n|pl={{tt|Uwaga, Pokémony robaki|Warning, Bug Pokémon}}\n|hi=बग पोकेमोन कॉन्टेस्ट {{tt|\'\'Bug Pokemon Contest\'\'|Bug Pokémon Contest}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP160 |\nprevtitle=Air Time! |\nnextcode=EP162 |\nnexttitle=Type Casting |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Johto | }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0161}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|161]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Hideki Sonoda]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Kazu Yokota]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Shigeru Ōmachi]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Yūsaku Takeda]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Ash]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a main character obtains a new Pokémon]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a main character releases or gives away a Pokémon]]\n\n[[de:Fang das Käfer-Pokémon!]]\n[[es:EP163]]\n[[fr:EP161]]\n[[it:EP161]]\n[[ja:無印編第161話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第162集]]'}
