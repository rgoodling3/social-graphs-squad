Clemont soon discovers that a leak in the roof has caused a short circuit, and recruits Luxray, Pikachu, and Dedenne to serve as a temporary source of electricity while he fixes it. Ash climbs up to repair the leak, and Serena and Bonnie offer to help Nurse Joy take care of the Pokémon.\n\nClemont needs a replacement fuse, but he can’t leave the still-sparking fuse box unattended, and everyone else is still hard at work. So he sends Chespin and Bunnelby into town with a note for the shopkeeper! Along the way, the two Pokémon run into Team Rocket...but just as Ash shows up looking for Chespin and Bunnelby, they send the villains blasting off all by themselves!\n\nEventually, they acquire the new fuse and bring it back to Clemont, who gets the power going again, and all is well...all except for Chespin, who eats way too much at the victory feast and becomes the newly restored Pokémon Center’s first patient!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{cleanup|section|width=50%}}\nThe episode opens up with {{Ash}} and {{Ashfr}} at a [[Pokémon Center]] after being caught in a downpour. In the mean time, Pikachu and Ash\'s other Pokémon receive a check-up by [[Nurse Joy]] and [[Nurse Joy\'s Wigglytuff|Wigglytuff]]. After {{an|Bonnie}} exclaims that the rain is never going to stop, {{an|Clemont}} pulls out his invention called the [[Clemontic Gear|"Weather Predictor"]] which collects data including the movement of rain clouds, wind, humidity and temperature to predict the weather. Clemont raises the analysis speed to make it work faster, but causes the invention to explode.\n\nAsh receives his Pokémon back and Nurse Joy states they are all perfectly fine.\n\nRain leaking from the ceiling causes a black out in the Pokémon Center. Clemont asks if he can have a look at the main electricity system and Nurse Joy and Wigglytuff guide them to it. Reaching there, Clemont realizes the leak has caused a {{wp|short circuit}}. Nurse Joy worries because she is still in the middle of treating some Pokémon. Clemont is determined to fix the problem.\n\nAsh decides the fix the leak, but {{an|Serena}} is worried because it is still raining outside. Clemont takes {{TP|Clemont|Luxray}} out of its ball and exclaims that Luxray and Pikachu could power the Pokémon Center for a while. Pikachu and {{TP|Clemont|Dedenne}} agree. Ash, Serena and Bonnie wish them good luck and leave.\n\nSince all the equipment are down, Nurse Joy hands out [[berries]] for the time being. Serena and Bonnie decide to help Nurse Joy, while Nurse Joy leaves to attend to a Pokémon requiring special treatment. Serena brings out {{TP|Serena|Braixen}} and {{TP|Serena|Pancham}} and start to hand out berries to {{pkmn|Trainer}}s.\n\nMeanwhile, Ash climbs to the roof but then slips. He sends out {{TP|Ash|Hawlucha}} and {{TP|Ash|Frogadier}} and asks them to help him fix the roof. Firstly, he asks Frogadier to make some [[Frubbles]] to stop him from slipping. Ash uses the Frubbles to get to the damaged part of the roof. While Hawlucha holds down a plank of wood, Ash asks Frogadier to look for more holes on the roof. Meanwhile, {{TP|Clemont|Bunnelby}} scrubs the wet floor down next to Clemont, while Dedenne snoozes off.\n\nAfter a while, Nurse Joy comes to see Clemont and asks how he is going and if he needs anything. Clemont asks for a spare fuse. Nurse Joy replies that she has no spare but that there is a store nearby. Suddenly, the system explodes again and Clemont goes hurriedly back into work. At that time, {{TP|Clemont|Chespin}} comes out of its ball saying that it will get the fuse. Chespin and Bunnelby head out to get the fuse.\n\nThe rain has stopped outside and Clemont straps a purse around Chespin\'s neck containing instructions for Chespin to show the shopkeeper. Clemont instructs Chespin and Bunnelby that the shop is straight down the path and warns them not to stray. Ash asks where the two are going to and Clemont answers that they are heading off on an errand. Clemont goes inside while Ash continues fixing the roof.\n\n{{TRT}} spy on Chespin and Bunnelby and plan to catch them to reel in Pikachu.\n\nAlong the way, Chespin jumps on puddles, wetting Bunnelby. Chespin also strays to a food shop but Bunnelby restrains Chespin. Soon after, Chespin runs off in adoration of {{p|Marill}} and again Bunnelby restrains him. Chespin holds up the purse, but is immediately stolen by a flying {{p|Fearow}}. The two chase after it.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the Pokémon Center, Ash enters the Center and notices Serena and Bonnie wearing Nurse Joy [[outfits]]. Ash goes to tell Nurse Joy the roof is fixed, while Serena and Bonnie attend to a trainer with a {{p|Purrloin}}.\n\nBack with Chespin and Bunnelby, Chespin attempts to retrieve the purse by using its vines. After this fails, Chespin throws Bunnelby into the air and Bunnelby successfully grabs onto the purse. Releasing the purse from the Fearow\'s claws, Bunnelby throws the purse down to Chespin. However, Fearow chases the two. Bunnelby digs a hole which they use to escape the Fearow. However, afterwards they realize they have strayed far off the path.\n\nBack at the Pokémon Center, Ash comes to check on Clemont and exclaims Chespin and Bunnelby have been gone for a long time. Ash decides to look for them using {{TP|Ash|Fletchinder}} and {{TP|Ash|Noibat}}.\n\nMeanwhile, Chespin and Bunnelby continue to the store, but eventually meet {{TRT}}. Team Rocket says their [[Team Rocket mottos|motto]] and {{an|James}} asks them to surrender. However, Chespin and Bunnelby decide to fight them. {{an|Jessie}} sends out {{TP|Jessie|Gourgeist}} and commands it to use {{m|Shadow Ball}}. James takes out {{TP|James|Inkay}} and asks them to surrender again. Meowth teases them that they cannot even do one simple errand, and Chespin remembers that Clemont is counting on it to finish the errand. Chespin charges forward, but Inkay retaliates with {{m|Tackle}}. James orders Inkay to fire a {{m|Psybeam}} but Bunnelby blocks it with {{m|Mud Shot}}. Jessie commands Gourgeist to use {{m|Seed Bomb}} but Chespin blocks with {{m|Vine Whip}}. Jessie gets mad and commands Gourgeist to use Shadow Ball again. However, its attack is blocked by Fletchinder, and Ash and Noibat arrive.\n\nShocked, Team Rocket switches to Plan B. Ash is about to begin his battle, but Bunnelby digs and comes out to fire a Mud Shot onto the faces of Team Rocket and their Pokémon. Chespin then uses {{m|Pin Missile}} causing {{TRT}} to blast off. Ash exclaims that he needn\'t need to worry all along and tells them to finish the errand.\n\nThe group arrive at the Pokémon Center and Clemont compliments them. Clemont uses the new fuse to fix the system, while Luxray and Pikachu continue to power the Center. Clemont completes his jobs and turns the electricity back on.\n\nNurse Joy thanks Ash and his friends but Ash states that Nurse Joy is always there to help them. The Pokémon eat and Clemont tells Chespin that it can eat all that it liked because of all its help. However, Chespin eats until it feels sick. Nurse Joy and Wigglytuff rush Chespin off. Serena jokes that Chespin is the first patient after the power has been turned back on. The other Pokémon sigh while a worried Clemont rushes off with Nurse Joy.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
