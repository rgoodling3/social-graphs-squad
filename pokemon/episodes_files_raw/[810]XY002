It first aired in Japan on October 17, 2013 and in the United States as a sneak peek preview of the full series on October 19, 2013 to coincide with the worldwide release of [[Pokémon X and Y]]. It later debuted in sequence in the United States on January 25, 2014.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/17_02-lumiose-city-pursuit/-->\n<i>As Serena trains with her mother to become a Rhyhorn racer—with little success or enthusiasm—Ash, Clemont, and Bonnie are in Lumiose City, racing to Professor Sycamore’s Pokémon Lab to get help for Froakie, who took a lot of damage during the battle with Team Rocket. The professor welcomes them and puts Froakie under the care of his assistant, Sophie, where he’s sure it will recover in no time. He explains to Ash and the others that Froakie is an unusual case—though it’s a Pokémon meant for new Trainers, it doesn’t always listen to them, and it’s been returned to the lab more than once. This shocks Ash, who admires the fearless Froakie for the way it saved Pikachu.\n\nSycamore also talks about his research on Pokémon Evolution, including a newly discovered phenomenon known as Mega Evolution, where even fully evolved Pokémon (like the friendly Garchomp that lives at the lab) can evolve again—and then return to their previous form. The science-minded Clemont is very intrigued…and so are Jessie, James, and Meowth, eavesdropping as usual. They decide to catch Garchomp and figure out how to make it Mega Evolve—but when they spring out of hiding and clamp a collar around Garchomp’s neck, it goes into a rampage, blasting them off immediately and crashing through the city until it ends up at the very top of Prism Tower.\n\nAsh goes after it, determined to get the collar off. With the help of one of Clemont’s brilliant inventions, he gets into the tower through a back entrance and starts climbing, with Pikachu and Froakie on his shoulders. There’s a huge crowd at the base of the tower watching Ash’s courageous rescue—and a news crew broadcasting the whole thing on TV, where Serena and her mother are watching.\n\nStruggling with its collar, Garchomp nearly steps off the edge of the tower, but Froakie acts fast and glues its feet to the building with some sticky Frubbles so it won’t fall. With Garchomp secured in place, Ash finally manages to get close to it, and a handy Iron Tail from Pikachu slices through the collar. The weary Garchomp is finally free!\n\nProfessor Sycamore thanks Ash for his bravery and gives him a new Pokédex for his journey. And it seems Ash will have a new friend to travel with, because as he turns to leave, Froakie blocks the way and presents Ash with its own Poké Ball. So, with Froakie on hand as his first Pokémon from the new region, Ash sets off on his journey in Kalos!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode begins with {{an|Serena}} being forced to train for {{p|Rhyhorn}} racing under the watchful eye of [[Grace (Kalos)|her mother]]. However, the Rhyhorn keeps jumping around and throws Serena off, causing her to scream at her mother in frustration.\n\nMeanwhile, in Lumiose City, {{Ash}} and {{an|Bonnie}}, with {{an|Clemont}} lagging behind, are rushing an [[XY001|injured]] {{AP|Froakie}} to {{an|Professor Sycamore}}\'s Pokémon research laboratory. They happen to run right by {{TRT}}, who overhears them talking about the research lab and immediately begin plotting to steal the Pokémon inside it. In the laboratory, Ash, Bonnie, and Clemont meet Professor Sycamore, who immediately expresses his concern for Froakie and gives him to his assistant [[Sophie]] so that she can treat his injuries. When Ash asks if Froakie\'s Trainer is on its way to pick up his Pokémon, Sycamore laments that the Trainer has given up on Froakie due to his [[Obedience|refusal to listen to orders]]. Even more shockingly, Sycamore tells them that Froakie has had multiple Trainers but either refused to obey them or simply didn\'t like them. After {{ashfr|the group}} introduces themselves to the professor, they see a {{p|Garchomp}} that lives at the laboratory, obviously worried about her friend Froakie. Since Garchomp is a gentle Pokémon, Sycamore allows Bonnie to pat her head and play with her. When Clemont brings up the subject of Pokémon evolution and asks if there are other Pokémon at the lab, Professor Sycamore takes the group to see them, but Ash waits until he has expressed his gratitude and admiration for Froakie to the injured Pokémon.\n\nAsh then joins Clemont and Bonnie in the area where all of the Pokémon live. While playing with the Pokémon, Professor Sycamore tells them how he is researching a method of [[evolution]] called [[Mega Evolution]] that can take place with certain Pokémon. He is still in the process of studying the topic, but it is his belief that a [[Friendship|strong bond]] and a special stone are the two keys to Mega Evolution. He also explains how Mega Evolution, unlike conventional Pokémon evolution, is not a permanent change and how Mega Evolved Pokémon can revert to their original states. Meanwhile, Team Rocket have been listening to the entire conversation and enter the lab disguised as scientists who have come to help Professor Sycamore with his Mega Evolution research, despite [[Sophie]] and [[Cosette]]\'s protests. Froakie, who has awoken from his rest, recognizes Team Rocket as the people who injured him before. Garchomp is also suspicious, and as Team Rocket throws a device at Froakie, she steps in front of her friend and falls prey to a collar that begins causing her obvious agony. Garchomp\'s shrieks are loud enough to alert Ash, Clemont, Bonnie, and Professor Sycamore to the events in the laboratory and they rush over to find an enraged Garchomp with Team Rocket. Although Team Rocket tries to make Garchomp come along with them, she sends them blasting off with an uncontrolled {{m|Hyper Beam}}. Before anybody in the laboratory can do anything, Garchomp flees into the streets of Lumiose City and sends Hyper Beams left and right, sending the townspeople into a panic.\n\nAs Ash, Clemont, Bonnie, and Professor Sycamore follow her and try to figure out what to do, Garchomp is still firing random Hyper Beams, showing no signs of calming down or even hearing their voices at all. [[Officer Jenny]] is evacuating the area, and a news crew is filming Garchomp in a helicopter as she flies towards [[Lumiose Gym|Prism Tower]]. After landing on the tower, she fires a Hyper Beam at the news helicopter, barely missing it. Back in [[Vaniville Town]], Grace is watching the broadcast and tells a still upset and rebellious Serena to come and have a look at what she is watching. Meanwhile, Ash decides to try and get close to Garchomp and, with Clemont\'s help, makes it into Prism Tower and begins climbing up to where Garchomp is. However, a Hyper Beam narrowly misses Clemont and Bonnie and blocks the entrance, leaving Ash alone to go and stop the rampaging Pokémon. Once Ash reaches the part of the tower where Garchomp is still rampaging, Professor Sycamore and Officer Jenny see him there and cry out in alarm. Barely dodging yet another Hyper Beam attack, Ash keeps trying to approach her.\n\nAsh continues to try to calm Garchomp down as the news crew notices him on Prism Tower. Serena\'s mother wonders if the boy she is seeing on the screen is Garchomp\'s Trainer, while Serena watches silently in amazement. Just as Ash begins to get close to her, Garchomp flies towards the top of the tower, with Ash, {{AP|Pikachu}} and Froakie following her on a ladder. Seeing how brave and selfless Ash is, Clemont decides that he needs to get up there and help. Using his [[Clemontic Gear|Aipom Arm]] to clear the rubble, Clemont manages to get himself and Bonnie to where Garchomp was, but Garchomp and Ash are now at the top of the tower. Ash is trying to get close to her again, but Garchomp is still shrieking in pain and stumbles back, almost falling off of the edge. However, Froakie uses his frubbles to pin Garchomp\'s feet to the tower, immobilizing her, and Ash grabs hold of her long enough for {{AP|Pikachu}} to destroy the collar with an {{m|Iron Tail}} attack. Relieved that Garchomp is all right, Pikachu and Froakie run towards her and Ash, but the edge of the tower collapses under Pikachu\'s feet due to the reduced structural integrity, sending him hurtling to the ground. In a desperate attempt to save his best friend, Ash dives over the edge after Pikachu, much to the horror of everyone watching. Just after Ash catches Pikachu, the Pokémon that Ash had seen earlier that day rescues them and deposits them safely in Centrico Plaza. As the Pokémon leaps away, Professor Sycamore tells Ash that the Pokémon is {{p|Blaziken}}\'s [[Mega Evolution]]. Clemont and Bonnie are both visibly relieved that Ash is all right, as is Serena. As Serena keeps watching the broadcast, the television shows a close-up of Ash\'s face, and she recognizes him as a boy she had met several years previously.\n\nThe next morning, after everybody got some sleep in the wrecked research lab, Sycamore gives Ash a [[List of Pokémon by Kalos Pokédex number|Kalos Pokédex]]. As Ash, Clemont and Bonnie leave the lab, they are surprised to see Froakie waiting there with his Poké Ball, looking expectantly up at Ash. Professor Sycamore says that Froakie has chosen Ash as his Trainer. With a new Pokémon and a new friend in the [[Kalos]] region, Ash prepares to leave for [[Santalune City]].\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

However, this was not the case in the preview airing, in which the episode used all of the original music.\n* In the initial airing of this episode, Ash says "Anyone who wouldn\'t want a Pokémon like you isn\'t too smart" while at the Professor\'s lab.
