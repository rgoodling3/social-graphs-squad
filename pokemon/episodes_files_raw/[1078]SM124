It first aired in Japan on June 2, 2019 and in the United States on October 5, 2019.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/22_32-living-on-the-cutting-edge/-->\n<i>Someone’s been slicing and dicing objects all over Melemele Island: a cabbage at Mallow’s Family Restaurant gets chopped up, a golden Viren statue is cut in half, and the trees in Lillie’s yard are shaped into perfect topiaries! These occurrences (and more) are the work of an Ultra Beast named Kartana, who can cut anything with its bladelike body. When the Ultra Guardians ask Kartana to stop its cutting spree, it ignores them—but later it saves the day by demolishing a meteor that’s barreling straight for the Pokémon School! Grateful for Kartana’s help, our heroes bid it farewell as it returns home through an Ultra Wormhole.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nOvernight, an [[Ultra Wormhole]] opens up and a {{DL|Ultra Beasts (anime)|Kartana}} emerges to look at its new surroundings. The glistening lights of [[Viren]]\'s latest development project, [[Viren Tower|Viren Stadium]], instantly attracts the {{an|Ultra Beasts|Ultra Beast}}. As Viren practices for the inauguration ceremony, showing off his gold statue to [[Viren\'s henchmen|his henchmen]], he orders a fireworks display. Meanwhile, Kartana promptly slices the statue in half and Viren\'s henchmen scramble to come up with a solution.\n\nThe following morning, [[Aina\'s Kitchen]] is preparing for another busy day of customers. At the same time, the radio announces that the {{p|Stufful}} meteor shower will appear overnight. {{an|Mallow}} prepares to slice up some cabbage when [[Abe|her father]] asks her to check on the pressure cooker. As she is away, Kartana soars into the restaurant and dices up the head of cabbage into thin pieces. Mallow returns to her work bench to find the sliced cabbage, but Abe is unable to explain anything. Meanwhile, {{an|Lillie}} and [[Snowy]] are preparing to leave home for [[Pokémon School]], with Lillie bidding {{p|Magearna}} farewell. Outside, [[Hobbes]] is neatening up the hedge trees and plans to make them into Pokémon {{wp|topiary}} trees. However, Kartana gets in first and cuts the hedges into geometric designs, shocking both Lillie and Hobbes.\n\nLater, {{an|Professor Kukui}} prepares to teach his class how to use [[move]]s to cut objects. {{Rotom}} is intrigued by the {{wp|makiwara}} and admits that it saw one during an episode of "Alolan Detective [[Laki]]". Kukui laughs at the Nogawa reference, admitting that makiwara are often used to practice sword skills. Attempts by {{Ash}}, Mallow, and {{an|Kiawe}} fail to fully cut the makiwara, and Professor Kukui admits that even sword masters struggle to cut down makiwara. Ash decides to try again with {{AP|Pikachu}}, but Kartana suddenly appears and cleanly cuts through the obstacle with ease before disappearing without being noticed. As everyone else is befuddled, Lillie and Mallow recall their strange experiences that morning.\n\nSuddenly, {{p|Komala}} rings the school bell and the students change into their [[Ultra Guardians]] uniforms. In the Ultra Guardians\' base, {{an|Lusamine}} and her staff show them a video of Kartana slicing through Viren\'s gold statue the previous night. Lillie instantly suspects that Kartana is an Ultra Beast, but [[Professor Burnet]] admits that she hasn\'t located an Ultra Wormhole. [[Wicke]] adds that Ultra Aura was detected for a moment and {{an|Faba}} affirms that the [[Aether Foundation]] is continuing its investigation. Lusamine orders the Ultra Guardians to capture Kartana before further damage is done. The still-multiplying horde of {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Meltan}} then present the Ultra Guardians with a box of [[Beast Ball]]s before they fly out of the base aboard their [[Poké Ride|Ride Pokémon]].\n\nAsh orders everyone to split up, and they cover the entirety of [[Melemele Island]]. Suddenly, Ash overhears a shrill scream, which leads him to the [[Hau\'oli City]] fruit markets. There, he finds [[Anela]], who is staring in shock at her sliced fruit. Meanwhile, Lillie arrives at {{OBP|Yoko|SM124}}\'s salon, where Kartana has already trimmed and styled her clients\' {{p|Furfrou}}. Elsewhere, {{p|Deoxys}} and {{p|Rayquaza}} are locked in {{pkmn|battle}}. Rayquaza fires a {{m|Hyper Beam}}, but Deoxys transforms into its {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Deoxys|Defense Forme}} to protect itself. The deflected attack strikes a meteor instead, sending it towards the {{pkmn|world|planet}} below.\n\nAt [[Bewear\'s den]], {{TRT}} watches Viren on his [[Television|shopping channel]] as he advertises the "Bling Bling Gold Safe", a seemingly indestructible safe. Viren orders his {{p|Electivire}} and {{p|Pangoro}} to attack the safe with {{m|Thunder Punch}} and {{m|Fire Punch}}, respectively, to no effect. Just then, Kartana appears and slashes through the safe with ease. Viren recognizes Kartana as the one who destroyed his statue and demands that it own up to its deeds as his Pokémon surround the Ultra Beast. {{MTR}} is in awe of Kartana\'s power and [[Jessie]] declares that it would make the perfect gift for {{an|Giovanni|the Boss}}.\n\nSoon after, Lusamine alerts Ash and the others to the latest Kartana sighting, this time at Viren Tower. However, by the time they reach it, Kartana has already cut its way to freedom. During the pursuit, Lillie suggests leading Kartana to the mountains to avoid more havoc in Hau\'oli City. Just then, Kartana prepares to attack the Pokémon School, forcing Ash and {{p|Garchomp}} to intervene. Ash explains no one wants anything cut in his world, which Kartana appears to understand. With the Ultra Beast placated, {{an|Lana}} throws out a Beast Ball, but Kartana slices through it. Realizing Kartana is unwilling to be caught, the Ultra Guardians battle it. Kiawe sends out {{TP|Kiawe|Marowak}} and orders it to use {{m|Flare Blitz}}, but the attack misses. Kartana then manages to cut Marowak\'s Ultra Guardian symbol as a warning.\n\nJust then, Team Rocket arrives inside a [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|Meowth robot]]. Right after Team Rocket ends their {{motto}}, Kartana is revealed to have sliced the robot in half already. Lusamine contacts the Ultra Guardians again, this time to abort the mission because one of the Stufful meteor shower\'s comets is headed directly at them. Faba issues an evacuation order for everyone within a kilometer of the school. Principal [[Samson Oak]] orders the Ultra Guardians to run, but Ash and {{ashcl}} declare they will not abandon the school. Team Rocket notices the comet quickly approaching, but {{an|Bewear}} arrives before they can enjoy the cataclysm. Bewear throws the trio into the Meowth robot, crushing the two halves together, and launching the mecha back to the den.\n\nAsh and the others use their Ride Pokémon to reach the comet. They decide to rapidly cool the comet to make it brittle before crushing it into smaller fragments. Lillie orders Snowy and {{p|Altaria}} to use {{m|Powder Snow}} and {{m|Ice Beam}}, respectively, while Lana has {{p|Dragonair}} add its own Ice Beam. As frost begins to encase the comet, Ash, Mallow, Kiawe, and Sophocles\'s Pokémon follow up with their own attacks, but their efforts only destroy the ice and not the comet. Kartana then soars upwards and cuts the comet into smaller fragments, which land in the ocean and cause a rainbow to appear in the sky. As Lusamine and Burnet check on the Ultra Guardians, Kartana opens up a new wormhole by itself with its slicing abilities and uses it to leave the [[Alola]] [[region]].\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

This phrase is often said by {{wp|samurai}} in old {{wp|Samurai cinema|samurai movies}}, as well as by Goemon Ishikawa XIII, a character from the manga and anime series \'\'{{wp|Lupin the Third}}\'\'. The dub translates this line as \'\'"Again, again, I cut a worthless object."\'\'\n** Its voice actor, [[Daisuke Namikawa]], is also the same voice actor for Goemon Ishikawa XIII as of 2011.\n** In addition, the animation in {{TRT}}\'s {{motto}} is in the same style as \'\'Lupin the Third\'\'.\n* This episode features the most [[Mythical Pokémon]] out of any anime episode to date, with four.\n* This episode marks the first appearance of a {{p|Deoxys}} in the anime since [[PK21]], nearly nine years earlier.\n* {{Ash}}, {{an|Professor Kukui}}, and {{AP|Rowlet}} narrate the preview for the [[SM125|next episode]].\n* Kartana [[Breaking the fourth wall|breaks the fourth wall]] twice, first when it slices the background at the end of Team Rocket\'s motto, and then when it cuts a hole and appears from the black background at the end of the episode.\n* The English dub title is a play on the phrase "living on the edge".\n\n===Errors===\n* In the first preview for this episode, when {{an|Kiawe}} is shown riding on his {{TP|Kiawe|Charizard}} after Kartana, he is seen in his normal clothes rather than his [[Ultra Guardians|Ultra Guardian]] uniform. This is corrected in the actual episode.\n* [[Sophocles\'s Vikavolt]] is shown with its Ultra Guardian symbol before the animation of the symbols appearing starts.\n* After the Ultra Guardians say "Ultroger", Primarina\'s bow is colored red instead of yellow.\n<gallery>\nFile:Ultra Guardians Pokémon.png|Primarina\'s bow error\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=90BDDC|bordercolor=F1912B\n|zh_cmn={{tt|鋒利無比！紙御劍登場！！|Perfect Sharpness!
