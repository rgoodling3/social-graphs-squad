Of course our heroes want to participate, but on this day the event is secretly being masterminded by none other than Team Rocket, who have two goals in mind: steal as many Pokémon as possible, and recruit a new Team Rocket member! But the last thing Team Rocket wants is for Ash and friends to get involved... but Ash and Dawn keep winning and moving on, stage after stage! Meanwhile, Team Rocket has their eyes on three gifted competitors in particular. What they don\'t know is that two of them are actually Pokémon thieves themselves, while the third is actually Officer Jenny in disguise and on the thieving duo\'s trail!\n\nTeam Rocket thinks they\'ve stolen all the competitors\' Pokémon, but they wind up empty-handed. It turns out that the mysterious duo has stolen the Pokémon that Team Rocket thought they had! But when the duo refuses to join up with Jessie, James and Meowth, a huge battle ensues. But with the help of Officer Jenny, the duo is arrested, the Poké Balls are all safely returned, and Team Rocket is sent blasting off once again.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{cleanup}}\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} are heading towards [[Lilypad Town]], the site of {{an|Dawn}}\'s next [[Pokémon Contest]], when she sees a poster announcing that her favorite show, [[Sinnoh Pokémon Hustle]], is holding auditions in [[Greenstation Town]], the group\'s current location. She, Ash and {{an|Brock}} decide to check the program out, however, unknown to them, the show is actually {{TRT}} setting up a test for future Team Rocket members. As they go to sign up, they see that {{si|Rhonda}} and the \'\'[[Sinnoh Now]]\'\' crew have come to cover the event. Rhonda says that she is surprised that there is a Pokémon Hustle event going on as she had no notification of it.\n\nAsh and his friends are looking at all the people that have entered and attempt to say hi to a few. A girl with purple hair, a boy with blue hair and a lady with blue hair ignore them. They are surprised by the people\'s coldness around there.\n\nTeam Rocket is happy with how many people are signing up until they see Ash and his friends. They make a plan to sabotage them in their events. Team Rocket announces to the participants that they are to put their [[Poké Ball]]s in cubbyholes, and they will be transferred to the kitchen. Little do they know that it is actually a funnel, putting all their Poké Balls in a bag.\n\nThe first event requires the Trainer to cross over two logs, one of which spins. The first person to try is a Trainer with his {{p|Oddish}}, who promptly falls in. Next is Ash and {{AP|Pikachu}} who make it across despite Team Rocket\'s interference. Then Dawn and {{TP|Dawn|Piplup}} manage to cross as well. Brock tries next but he and {{TP|Brock|Happiny}} fall in, so does a Trainer and her {{p|Teddiursa}}. Then two talented Trainers named Crimson and Azure as well as a lady and her {{p|Growlithe}} successfully cross.\n\nThe second stage of the competition is revealed to be a challenge where the Trainer swings across the water from one platform to another trying not to fall off when they hit a big, spinning yellow tube. Ash tries first and just barely manages to cross, encountering trouble at the spinning tube. Dawn also manages to make it across along with [[Azure]], [[Crimson]] and the lady with the Growlithe. [[Jessie]], [[James]] and {{MTR}} head over to check on the Poké Balls to find that they are gone. Ash finds them and accuses them of taking the Pokémon. All the Trainers begin to crowd around and Team Rocket take off their disguises and perform their motto. When the Trainers ask for their Pokémon back they inform them that they do not know where they are.\n\nSuddenly the lady from earlier rips off her disguise revealing that she is [[Officer Jenny]]. She points towards Azure and Crimson and says that they have stolen the Pokémon. Brock begins to flirt with her but Pikachu and Piplup drag him away. Team Rocket decides to help Azure and Crimson escape from the crowd and leads them up a tall ramp that has huge balls balanced at the top. The crowd of Trainers begins to follow them up the ramp. James pushes the balls off and takes out many of the Trainers except for Officer Jenny - who is shown jumping them - and Ash, Dawn, and Brock, who hang on the side. Team Rocket then leads them down a zip line. As Jenny, Ash, Dawn and Brock follow, they cut the zip line, causing the others to fall. Team Rocket then praises Azure and Crimson who are not the least impressed and say that they are a two person team. Crimson and Azure then send out their {{p|Zangoose}} and {{p|Drowzee}} and send Team Rocket flying backwards. Jenny sends out Growlithe who uses {{m|Flame Wheel}} on Drowzee, getting everybody\'s Poké Balls back. Ash then sends out {{AP|Buizel}} who uses {{m|Water Gun}} on Drowzee and Zangoose. Jessie and James then send out {{TP|Jessie|Yanmega}} but they are sent blasting off by Drowzee\'s {{m|Shadow Ball}}. Growlithe then defeats Drowzee with {{m|Hidden Power}} and Pikachu defeats Zangoose with {{m|Iron Tail}}. Jenny then arrests both Azure and Crimson. Brock then again flirts with Officer Jenny but is taken off by {{TP|Brock|Croagunk}}. Jenny then leaves with Azure and Crimson, and then after saying good-byes Ash, Dawn, and Brock continue yet again on their way to Lilypad Town.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
