It first aired in Japan on September 15, 2019<!-- and is scheduled to air in the United States on *day*-->.\n{{spoilers}}\n<!--\n==Blurb==\nOfficial Blurb from Pokémon.com goes here, with source link-->\n<!--Please do not alter the blurb to fix any errors, they are meant to be presented as they are on the official site.-->\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{an|Gladion}} begin their [[Manalo Conference]] finals battle. {{p|Zoroark}} uses {{m|Night Daze}}, but {{AP|Pikachu}} counters with {{m|Thunderbolt}}. Gladion follows up with {{m|Shadow Claw}}, and Pikachu uses {{m|Iron Tail}} to block it. Zoroark then uses Shadow Claw, eventually striking its foe. Pikachu dusts himself off in time to leap upwards to evade another Night Daze, but Zoroark lashes him with Shadow Claw as he descends towards the field. Gladion sees an opening and activates his [[Z-Power Ring]] to have Zoroark unleash the {{m|Never-Ending Nightmare}}. The [[Z-Move]] plunges the arena into darkness and a multitude of eerie hands pursue Pikachu. With the dark hands seemingly inescapable, Ash orders Pikachu to counter with a Z-Move of his own. Using {{m|Breakneck Blitz}}, Pikachu rushes through the wall of hands and strikes Zoroark. Gladion\'s Z-Move still connects, resulting in a large explosion that knocks both Pokémon out, leaving Ash and Gladion with one Pokémon each remaining. After [[recall]]ing their Pokémon, they return to their places and glare at each other. Ash compliments Gladion for being in perfect sync with Zoroark, while Gladion admits only Ash would be able to break through his Z-Move like that. Just then, the two boys burst into laughter, taking the audience by surprise. Ash soon catches his breath and tells Gladion that this was their best battle yet, with Gladion agreeing.\n\nWith that, the two sides decide to settle an old score, both sending out their {{p|Lycanroc}} as their final Pokémon. Ash and Gladion both open with {{m|Stone Edge}}, canceling each other\'s efforts out. Ash orders his {{AP|Lycanroc}} to use {{m|Accelerock}}, which [[Gladion\'s Lycanroc]] intercepts with {{m|Counter}} before punching Ash\'s away. Gladion then goes for another Stone Edge, which Ash\'s Lycanroc evades by running alongside the attack, then goes to use {{m|Bite}}. Ash orders his Lycanroc to stop as he sees it readying another Counter. Gladion switches tactics and orders a new Stone Edge, though Ash\'s Lycanroc dodges it. Ash orders his Lycanroc to charge ahead and continue attacking. It dodges an oncoming Stone Edge and prepares to lash its opponent with an Accelerock. Gladion orders another Stone Edge, though Ash\'s Lycanroc jumps on top of the boulders and manages to hit Gladion\'s. Gladion\'s Lycanroc grins as it uses Counter to deliver an uppercut to Ash\'s Lycanroc, who is unable to dodge because of its momentum.\n\nAs both Lycanroc take heavy blows but continue to fight on, Gladion orders his Lycanroc to boost its power with {{m|Swords Dance}}, then follow up with {{m|Outrage}}. Ash\'s Lycanroc uses Stone Edge, but Gladion\'s Lycanroc smashes right through it with its Outrage. As Gladion\'s Lycanroc confronts Ash\'s, it is suddenly overcome by the Outrage\'s after-effects of {{status|confusion}}. Ash orders Lycanroc to use Bite, but Gladion\'s Lycanroc snaps out of its confusion after biting on its own paw, and it lands a hit with Counter. Gladion admits that he developed the confusion-snapping strategy to avoid calamity during a heated battle, much to Ash\'s astonishment.\n\nGladion calls for Stone Edge, while Ash has his Lycanroc chomp through the obstacles. Gladion\'s Lycanroc repeats its attack, prompting Ash\'s Lycanroc to use Accelerock to break through. It then charges at Gladion\'s Lycanroc, who immediately uses Counter. As it takes the blow, Ash has Lycanroc use its own Counter, which defeats Gladion\'s Lycanroc. Kukui declares Gladion\'s Lycanroc to be unable to battle and announces that the winner is Ash, making him the first official [[Alola League]] {{pkmn|Champion}}. Ash is left speechless by the result, though Gladion affirms that Ash has indeed won the tournament and shakes his hand to congratulate him. Gladion suggests they battle again sometime, and Ash agrees to it.\n\nMeanwhile underground, {{TRT}} are surprised to see that Ash has won the League. [[Jessie]] then asks James if their mech is finished; [[James]] puts on the final bolt and happily confirms that it is complete. The trio cheer as they prepare to plunder the League of every single Pokémon, etching their names into the history of [[Alola]]. Meanwhile at [[Bewear\'s den]], the {{p|Oranguru}} robot is completely destroyed and shuts down, while {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Stufful}} and {{an|Bewear}} are nowhere to be seen.\n\nAt night the awards ceremony takes place, with [[Professor Burnet]] disappointed that Kukui isn\'t there to see Ash’s big moment. The Masked Royal steps onto the stage, and gives Ash his trophy and congratulates him on becoming Champion. Ash thanks the Masked Royal and adds that he is excited for [[SM141|tomorrow’s exhibition match]]. The crowd again claps for their new Champion, with {{Rotom}} taking a commemorative [[photography|photograph]] of the moment. Suddenly, [[Wicke]] detects an [[Ultra Wormhole]] signal directly over [[Manalo Stadium]]. Burnet, {{an|Lusamine}} and the others turn their attention to the sky as the wormhole expands, before an [[Ultra Beast]] emerges from it. The creature crashes into the stadium field below and reveals itself to be a {{DL|Ultra Beasts (anime)|Manalo Stadium Guzzlord|Guzzlord}}, much to Ash\'s alarm.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
