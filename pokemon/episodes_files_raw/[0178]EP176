As Misty picks the local flora, Togepi wanders over to a very strange looking bush, it appears to have legs…spider legs! Summoned by Misty’s shrieks, Ash and Brock discover an {{p|Ariados}} in the bush. Just then, the Ariados\'s apparent Trainer reveals herself. The Trainer turns out to be {{an|Aya}}, the sister of [[Koga]], Fuchsia City\'s Gym Leader, [[EP032|from Kanto]]. She explains she’s training with her Ariados to learn the special art of Pokémon Jujitsu (a form of Martial Arts). Under the guidance of a Pokémon tutor, the Sensei of a Dojo, who is the true owner of Ariados, she is trying to perfect her skills in Pokémon Jujitsu alongside her Venonat. Accepting an invitation from the Sensei, the gang joins her for a day at the [[Pokémon Jujitsu Academy]]. \n\nDonning special uniforms, red-colored for battle technique studies, which Ash chooses, yellow-colored for the technical class, which Brock chooses, and blue-colored for beauty-classes, which Misty is assigned. Initially reluctant to attend a beauty class, she swiftly changes her mind when told that the beauty treatments taught can make one look like a "movie star". To her horror, the treatment involves {{p|Spinarak}} webbing is applied to the face as a moisturizer. Meanwhile, Brock and his {{TP|Brock|Pineco}} impress the class and its teacher with their highly synchronized battle demonstration. In Ash\'s class, he and Aya have a rematch of their battle. Ash uses his {{AP|Bulbasaur}} against Aya\'s {{p|Venonat}}, and initially the battle follows the same pattern as their previous match, with Bulbasaur using his powerful {{m|Leech Seed}} attack to simultaneously trap and drain Venonat\'s energy. \n\nHowever, Venonat shrugs off the Leech Seed and nearly wins the battle with a {{m|Supersonic}}-{{m|Tackle}} combination. Demonstrating Ash and his Pokémon\'s ingenuity and understanding of each other, Bulbasaur uses his {{m|Vine Whip}} to push himself high into the air, and then at Ash\'s prompting, uses Vine Whip to attack Venonat from the air, winning the match. Meanwhile, {{TRT}} observes the battle and the amount of rare Pokémon present at the center, and plots to steal the Pokémon. Later, when everyone is going to sleep, Pikachu hears a noise outside the center, so Ash goes to investigate, finding Aya training. They contemplate their future\'s as Trainers, until Venonat notices a strange occurrence. They find [[Poké Ball]]s of most of the Trainers at the center to be stolen, moments later, Team Rocket unveils themselves as the thieves. They grab Pikachu and trap him in a metal cage (preventing the effectiveness of his electric attacks). \n\nAs they take flight in their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|balloon]], the Sensei utilizes his glider to intercept Team Rocket and sabotage their balloon. He drops the Poké Balls to Ash and friends below, and then falls from the balloon. Exhausted by the pursuit, and Ash\'s Pikachu still trapped in a metal cage, the Sensei and Ariados cannot battle Team Rocket, leaving it up to Aya. She worries that she is not prepared to battle Team Rocket, though is assured by the Sensei that no one is ever fully ready for battle. Ordering her Pokémon to rest (it is not stated if it is actually using the move "Rest" or is simply sleeping), she makes a gamble that her Venonat will be able to last the duration of the time it is unable to respond to attacks, and is proven correct. \n\nUpon waking, it uses {{m|Tackle}} and {{m|Stun Spore}}, stunning {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}}. Ash finally succeeds in removing Pikachu from the cage, and returns to beat [[Jessie]] and [[James]]\' final attack. Aya reflects upon her choice to take a chance, and is praised by the Sensei for her turning "weakness into strength". When Ash and friends prepare to leave, the Sensei thanks them for their help, and promises them a place in his Dojo should they ever return.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} meet up with {{an|Aya}} again.\n* [[Brock\'s Pineco]] is revealed to know {{m|Spikes}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Ariados}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n[[File:Dare da EP176.png|thumb|200px|right|{{tt|Dare da?|Who\'s That Pokémon?}}]]\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{an|Aya}}\n* [[Tōkichi]]\n* {{OBP|Ralph|EP176}}\n* [[Mickey]]\n* Other students\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP EP176.png|thumb|200px|right|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Jigglypuff}} \'\'(US and international)\'\', {{p|Ariados}} \'\'(Japan)\'\'\n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Togepi}} ({{OP|Misty|Togepi}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Bulbasaur}} ({{OP|Ash|Bulbasaur}})\n* {{p|Pineco}} ({{OP|Brock|Pineco}})\n* {{p|Arbok}} ({{OP|Jessie|Arbok}})\n* {{p|Venonat}} ({{an|Aya}}\'s)\n* {{p|Ariados}} ([[Tōkichi]]\'s; debut)\n* {{p|Hypno}} ([[Mickey]]\'s)\n* {{p|Houndour}} ({{OBP|Ralph|EP176}}\'s)\n* {{p|Gloom}} (Trainer\'s)\n* {{p|Hitmonlee}} (Trainer\'s)\n* {{p|Starmie}} (Trainers\'; ×4)\n* {{p|Scyther}} (Trainer\'s)\n* {{p|Pidgey}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Spinarak}} (×5)\n\n==Trivia==\n* The English title of this episode is a play on the Spanish phrase \'\'"{{tt|adios amigos|goodbye friends}}"\'\'.\n* This is the last episode to air in Japan before the earliest release of {{game|Crystal}}.\n* This episode was banned in {{pmin|South Korea}}, likely due to the overt focus on Japanese culture. \n* What [[Tōkichi]] says in this episode in regards to beauty ("Beautiful people are more beautiful...more so than people who are as they are") is similar to a line from \'\'[[EP169|Beauty and the Breeder]]\'\', in which [[Jessie]] and [[James]] say, "Beautiful Pokémon are more beautiful...more so than people who are as they are".\n* Jessie\'s dance after the {{motto}}, when she mentions a list of Pokémon, could be a reference to the anime series \'\'{{wp|Magical Princess Minky Momo}}\'\'.\n\n===Errors===\n* In the scene where {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} are seen in ninja jumpsuits, {{an|Misty}} is drawn with brown eyes when talking, instead of her usual blue ones.\n* When the episode title is read, the usual Pokémon logo isn\'t in the top left-hand corner.\n* {{an|Aya}}\'s {{p|Venonat}} uses {{m|Poison Sting}} in this episode, despite being [[anime move errors|unable to learn Poison Sting normally]].\n\n<gallery>\nEP176 Error.png|The missing logo\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n* The original airing of this episode on Hungama TV in {{pmin|India}} started the episode directly from the title card, skipping the part of the episode that comes before it.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|bg={{tt|Ариадос, Амигос|Ariados, Amigos}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|阿利多斯，忍術戰鬥|Ariados, Battle of Ninja Arts}}\n|cs={{tt|Ariados, amigos|Ariados, friends}}\n|nl={{tt|Ariados, Amigos|Ariados, friends}}\n|de=Pokémon Jujitsu\n|fi={{tt|Pokémon-Jujitsua|Pokémon Jujitsu}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|L\'école|The school}}\n|he=פוקימון ג\'וג\'יטסו Pokémon Jujitsu\n|it={{tt|Accademia dei ninja|Ninja academy}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Ariados, Amigos|Ariados, Friends}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Ariados, amigo!|Ariados, my friend!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Amigos de Ariados|Ariados\' friends}}\n|pl={{tt|Mocna pajęczyna|Strong web}}\n|sv={{tt|Ariados amigos|Ariados friends}}\n|hi=Ariados - एक बग पोकेमोन {{tt|\'\'Ariados - Ek Bug Pokemon\'\'|Ariados - A Bug Pokemon}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n}}\n\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP175 |\nprevtitle=Trouble With Snubbull |\nnextcode=EP177 |\nnexttitle=Wings \'N\' Things |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Johto | }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0176}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|176]]\n[[Category:Banned episodes]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Shinzō Fujita]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded and directed by Tarō Iwasaki]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Tarō Iwasaki]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Tarō Iwasaki]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Katsumi Hashimoto]]\n\n[[de:Pokémon Jiu-Jitsu]]\n[[es:EP178]]\n[[fr:EP176]]\n[[it:EP176]]\n[[ja:無印編第176話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第177集]]'}
