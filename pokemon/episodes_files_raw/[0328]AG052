Lighthouse! He\'s a member of a pep squad school that cheers at Pokémon battles, led by a man named Sheridan.\n\nA disguised Team Rocket offers Sheridan money to cheer for their Pokémon battles. To test the effectiveness of the cheering, Brock and Ash offer to battle against Team Rocket.\n\nBrock\'s Forretress knocks out James\' Cacnea, who is secretly revived using Helping Hand. Sheridan wears a mask containing a small microphone that he uses to give directions to Pokémon hidden inside the pep squad\'s giant drums.\n\nAfter Cacnea wins, it\'s Ash and Pikachu versus Jessie and Seviper. Jessie doesn\'t pay attention to the battle, and Seviper is quickly taken down. Sheridan issues commands to revive Seviper repeatedly.\n\nMax sneaks nearby and knocks the drums over, revealing the Pokémon concealed inside. Sheridan runs off, and Ash manages to encourage Pikachu to victory.\n\nTeam Rocket then reveal themselves, but Pikachu is too weak to fight them off. Plusle and Minun revive Pikachu, whose Thunder attack starts a thunderstorm. A bolt of lightning hits Team Rocket\'s balloon, sending them blasting off.\n\nThe members of the pep squad decide to go home, Thatcher continues his Pokémon journey, while Ash and friends continue to Lavaridge Town.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAs {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} continue their journey, {{an|May}} admires her first {{pkmn|Contest}} [[Ribbon]]. Excited at reaching the next town, Ash accidentally takes the wrong path. After hearing a set of banging drums, the group follow the commotion up a fleet of stairs and stumble across a group of people. Among them is a familiar face, [[Thatcher]] with his {{p|Plusle}} and {{p|Minun}}. He tells Ash and the others that he joined a pep squad that believes in the power of {{m|Helping Hand|cheering}}. Meanwhile {{TRT}} spots a new opportunity to steal {{AP|Pikachu}}, and they recruit Sheridan, the leader of the pep squad school, to assist their efforts. Sheridan, invites Ash and friends to join him in a battle to demonstrate the power of cheering. They readily accept the challenge.\n\nThe first match pits {{an|Brock}} against "[[James]]ter", who is in [[List of Team Rocket\'s disguises|disguise]]. Brock sends out {{TP|Brock|Forretress}} to battle {{TP|James|Cacnea}}. Forretress uses {{m|Rapid Spin}} to deflect Cacnea\'s {{m|Pin Missile}} attack before bowling it over with a {{m|Tackle}}. As Cacnea struggles to its feet, Sheridan and his squad begin cheering. Unbeknownst to the group, Sheridan whispers "Helping Hand" into a microphone. Out of nowhere, Cacnea regains health and defeats Forretress with a barrage of attacks. Ash and May are dumbfounded, but [[Max]] thinks something is amiss. As Ash takes on "[[Jessie|Jessica]]", also in disguise, Max goes on the hunt for clues. While she begins thinking of how to attack Pikachu, the {{t|Electric}} mouse begins attacking her {{TP|Jessie|Seviper}}. Angered, Jessie demands Sheridan begin to cheer, but he silences her, requesting patience. As soon as Seviper appears to have lost all energy, the cheering starts. Once again, Sheridan whispers {{m|Aromatherapy}} into a microphone. A {{p|Roselia}} and {{p|Vileplume}} are shown to be hidden inside one of the drums. Both unleash their attacks.\n\nNow convinced that something is seriously wrong, Max overhears Sheridan whispering "Helping Hand", and Max realizes that he is giving Pokémon directions for attacking. Meanwhile, Seviper has now regained health and is attacking Pikachu. Just as Pikachu is about to lose, Max shoves the drums over, revealing the Roselia, Vileplume, {{p|Makuhita}}, and {{p|Shroomish}} that were inside. Sheridan is stunned that his scheme has been revealed. After Thatcher and the other pep squad members demand a refund, Sheridan takes off running, and the Rocket trio attempt to steal Pikachu. Seviper {{m|Wrap}}s itself around Pikachu, but loses control of him after a powerful {{m|Thunder}} attack. Following her defeat, Jessie removes her disguise while her teammates appear with the [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|Meowth balloon]] in time to perform their {{motto}}. Jessie is disappointed that they don’t have a new mecha, though {{MTR}} explains that they used all their saving to pay Sheridan. Meowth, instead clicks and button and grabs Pikachu with a mechanical claw. As Team Rocket reel in Pikachu, Thatcher steps up and has his Pokemon lend a Helping Hand. The charge gives Pikachu an overwhelming surge of power, and he summons dark storm clouds. Soon enough, lightning finally strikes Team Rocket\'s balloon, sending them blasting off. Although he is left disappointed, Thatcher tells Ash that he really admires his work with Pikachu. He promises to work hard and start from scratch to eventually become as great a {{pkmn|Trainer}} as Ash someday, inspiring some of his fellow squad members to do the same. The group bids farewell to Thatcher and heads off on their next adventure.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} meet up with [[Thatcher]] again.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Thatcher]]\n* [[Alyssa]] (flashback)\n* [[Sheridan]]\n* Cheering Squad\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:PTC AG052.png|thumb|200px|right|Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]\n[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]: {{p|Torkoal}}\n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Forretress}} ({{OP|Brock|Forretress}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Cacnea}} ({{OP|James|Cacnea}})\n* {{p|Plusle}} ([[Thatcher]]\'s)\n* {{p|Minun}} ([[Thatcher]]\'s)\n* {{p|Vileplume}} ([[Sheridan]]\'s)\n* {{p|Shroomish}} ([[Sheridan]]\'s)\n* {{p|Makuhita}} ([[Sheridan]]\'s)\n* {{p|Roselia}} ([[Sheridan]]\'s)\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[Smile]] replaced [[Because the Sky is There]] as the [[List of Japanese ending themes|Japanese ending theme]].\n* The title is a pun on "{{wp|peer pressure}}".\n\n===Errors===\n* While {{p|Torkoal}} is said in the Trainer\'s Choice to be the best choice against {{p|Shiftry}}, it is actually equally effective as {{p|Taillow}} because both have a type advantage against {{type|Grass}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}.\n* The opening sequence shows May\'s first [[Ribbon]] to be in the top left slot of her Ribbon case, whereas in the previous episode she placed it in the middle slot.\n* In the [[AG051|last episode]], there was no symbol on {{an|May}}\'s Ribbon case; however, in this episode there was.\n* When Thatcher runs up to Ash and the others and asks if they remember him, Ash\'s z\'s under his eyes are missing.\n\n===Dub edits===\n====[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]====\n* Question: Trainers, which one of these Pokémon is the best choice to battle {{p|Shiftry}}?\n* Choices: {{p|Swampert}}, {{p|Taillow}}, {{p|Torkoal}}\n* Answer: OK, Trainers, if you chose {{p|Torkoal}}, you were right!\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=9999FF|bordercolor=FF7777\n|zh_cmn={{tt|正電拍拍與負電拍拍，應援之道？|Plusle and Minun, The Way of Assisting?}}\n|nl={{tt|Ontmoediging|Discouragement}}\n|da={{tt|Heppekor med forhindringer|Cheerleading with hindrances}}\n|de={{tt|Der falsche Meister|The wrong master}}\n|fi={{tt|Pokémon-kannustuksen voima|The power of Pokémon cheering}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Des supporters difficile à supporter|Supporters difficult to support}}\n|he=לעודד או לא לעודד{{tt|leoded o lo leoded|To cheer or not to cheer}}\n|it={{tt|Altro che tifo!|This is certainly not support!}}\n|ko={{tt|플러시랑 마이농! 응원의 길|Plusle and Minun!
