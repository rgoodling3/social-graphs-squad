It first aired in Japan on April 30, 2015 and in the United States on July 4, 2015.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!-- http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/18_22-beyond-the-rainbow/-->\n<i>Pikachu, Dedenne, and Wooper have been kidnapped, and after an intense battle with Florges, Goodra is in no shape to go after them! While our heroes start a search, the real motivation behind the attack on Goodra’s home becomes clear: Florges is taking care of a sad little Floette, who needs the spring’s healing water to get better. But now, the water appears to be drying up.\n\nSoon, everyone discovers the truth: the Team Rocket trio are slowly draining the wetlands so they can sell the healing water for profit! Goodra and Florges decide to work together against this common enemy, and their combined efforts soon send Team Rocket blasting off again.\n\nWhen Ash sees how happy Goodra is to be home, he makes a tough decision and offers to let Goodra stay and protect the wetlands and its friends who live there. After many heartfelt farewells, our heroes are off once again to Laverre City, and Goodra is back home!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nContinuing the story [[XY069|begun in the previous episode]], {{Ash}} chases several {{type|Bug}} and {{type|Poison}} Pokémon as they kidnap {{AP|Pikachu}}, {{TP|Clemont|Dedenne}}, and {{p|Wooper}}. Despite the best efforts of {{AP|Goodra}}, {{AP|Frogadier}}, and {{AP|Fletchinder}}\'s best efforts, the opposing Pokémon are able to escape. However, {{an|Clemont}} tells the group that he has discovered {{TRT}}\'s involvement in the recent events. Following Goodra\'s lead, Ash and {{ashfr}} leave to find their missing friends.\n\nMeanwhile, at the spring taken over by {{an|Florges}} and her Bug-type and Poison-type army, Team Rocket has put Pikachu, Dedenne, and Wooper into special cages to prevent their escape. Florges worries over her sick {{p|Floette}}, but Floette is not healing because the water is running low and its special healing properties are insufficient to save Floette. Back at [[Keanan]]\'s cabin, Keanan comes to the same conclusion and immediately heads out to discover the cause of the problem. Meanwhile, Ash and his friends arrive at the outer area of the spring, but several Bug-type Pokémon are keeping watch and refuse to believe {{an|Bonnie}}\'s claims about Team Rocket\'s treachery since they only listen to Florges, not anyone else. Left with no choice but to battle, {{an|Clemont}} and {{an|Serena}} keep the Pokémon occupied while Ash and Bonnie go with Goodra to find Florges. The three of them enter the spring, but it appears at first glance to be deserted. Suddenly, Florges appears behind them, flanked by two {{p|Seviper}}. Like the other Pokémon, Florges believes Team Rocket\'s story and refuses to accept Ash and Bonnie\'s claims to the contrary. Ash and Bonnie then notice the decline in the water level, and as they begin to piece together the story when they realize that Floette is Florges\'s child, the water begins to drain away completely. At that moment, [[Jessie]], [[James]], and {{MTR}} reveal themselves and their captive Pokémon. They boast about their plan to take away all of the water in the wetlands, and Florges finally realizes that she and her Pokémon army had been tricked all along. Before she can retaliate, however, Team Rocket escapes.\n\nOutside the spring cave, Clemont, Serena, and Keanan watch as Team Rocket\'s previously hidden airship takes to the skies and prepares to leave, and they meet with Ash and Bonnie again. Ash explains to everyone that Florges took control of the marshlands so she can heal Floette, but the water is now taken by Team Rocket. Goodra uses its antenna to fling Ash onto Team Rocket\'s ship, and Florges follows on a {{p|Yanmega}}. Using {{m|Dragon Pulse}} as a propellant, Goodra gives itself enough thrust to board the airship as well. Although Team Rocket tries to shake them off, Goodra blasts a hole in the side of the ship and the three of them enter. They quickly spot Pikachu, Dedenne, and Wooper, and rush to save them, but are confronted by Team Rocket. The conflict quickly escalates into a [[Double Battle]], with {{TP|James|Inkay}} and {{TP|Jessie|Pumpkaboo}} fighting Florges and Goodra. When Inkay and Pumpkaboo target Florges, Goodra steps in and defends her, and when both Pokémon switch their focus to Goodra, Florges stops the attacks and sends Pumpkaboo flying into the control panel for the cages holding Pikachu, Dedenne, and Wooper. Once Pikachu and the others escape their cages, Jessie and James attempt to have Inkay and Pumpkaboo attack again, but they are easily overpowered and sent blasing off by Goodra and Florges.\n\nWith the water draining out of the ship, a Yanmega arrives to take Pikachu, Dedenne, and Wooper back down to the surface. Florges loses her balance and falls off of the airship, only to be saved by Goodra. However, an untimely explosion sends both Pokémon plummeting for the surface, and Ash dives after them. Despite the efforts of three {{p|Beedrill}} to save the group, they continue falling until all of the {{type|Water}} Pokémon on the ground use {{m|Water Gun}} to save them. With the danger passed, the group turns to other problems - namely, the completely dried-out wetlands. To remedy this, Goodra uses {{m|Rain Dance}} to restore the water, and Florges uses her {{m|Grassy Terrain}} to revitalize the area. At last, Florges is able to revive her Floette, much to everyone\'s relief. \n\nAs the sun comes up the next morning, the Pokémon have all made up with each other and are now one large community. As Ash, his friends, Keanan, and Goodra stand on a hill overlooking the wetlands, Ash tells Goodra to stay behind. Now that Goodra has achieved its goal of becoming strong, it can serve as a protector and friend to the Pokémon living in the area. As Goodra and Ash share a tearful goodbye hug, everyone recalls all of the good times they had with Goodra, ever since they day it fell onto Ash\'s head as a {{p|Goomy}} and how Ash helped it to grow and evolve until it was powerful enough to defeat [[Clemont\'s Luxray]] and win him his fifth badge. Ash controls his tears, promising Goodra that no matter what happens or how far apart they are, they\'ll always be friends just as {{TP|Clemont|Dedenne}}, still crying, jumps up for a hug. \n\nSoon Ash and his friends begin on their way to [[Laverre City]], Ash bidding Goodra goodbye as the group leaves the wetlands.\n\n==Major events==\n<!--This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
