(Part 2)\'\') is the 60th episode of the {{series|Best Wishes}}, and the 717th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on December 22, 2011 and in the United States on May 5, 2012.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/15_12-stopping-the-rage-of-legends-part-2/-->\n<i>Soon after arriving on Milos Island to find the rare medicinal plants known as Revival Herbs for Driftveil Gym Leader Clay, our heroes, along with island resident Lewis, encountered the Legendary Pokémon Tornadus and Thundurus. The barriers erected to keep them away were destroyed by Team Rocket, and the two Pokémon are now battling ferociously, threatening the island’s existence.\n\nWith the help of Lewis and his Gothorita, Iris successfully summons the Legendary Pokémon Landorus, the island’s guardian and the only one who can control Tornadus and Thundurus. But after Landorus appears, Team Rocket shows up! It turns out they destroyed the barriers as part of a plot to capture all three of these powerful Legendary Pokémon! Ash, Iris, and Cilan team up to defeat the villainous trio and free the three legends—but when the three-way battle starts up again, it’s clear that Landorus was seriously injured in the rescue attempt, and Tornadus and Thundurus seem to have the upper hand.\n\nLewis collects the few Revival Herbs he has left and offers them to Landorus, who is immediately revitalized! With its newfound strength, Landorus finally manages to stop the battle between Tornadus and Thundurus and convince them to work together to restore Milos Island to its pristine condition. Now, Revival Herbs grow quickly in enormous quantities—more than enough to satisfy Clay’s request. It looks like Ash is off to his next Gym battle!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nThe flash of light shines brighter and {{p|Landorus}} appears. {{TRT}} from a distance notice Landorus\'s arrival. As Landorus ascends down to everyone, [[Lewis]] explains the dire situation with [[Milos Island]], and the conflict with {{p|Thundurus}} and {{p|Tornadus}}. Lewis asks Landorus to help stop the fighting. Looking at the sky, everyone notices flashes of lightning from the battle between Thundurus and Tornadus. Landorus heads towards where the battle is occurring. Everyone hopes that Landorus can take care of the problem. {{an|Iris}} lets Gothorita know that it did a good job summoning Landorus, while {{TP|Iris|Axew}} agrees causing Gothorita to blush. Meanwhile, Landorus sends Tornadus and Thundurus down from the sky and asks them to stop fighting. {{Ash}}, {{ashfr}}, and Lewis head towards them. Thundurus and Tornadus begin to attack Landorus instead of calming down, but Landorus uses {{m|Protect}} to shield himself. They continue battling each other, while Landorus seems to have the upper hand even though he is outnumbered. Meanwhile, Team Rocket call [[Dr. Zager]] and ask him how far away he is from their location. He tells them that he is closing in on their location.\n\nTornadus, Thundurus, and Landorus continue battling each other, and one of the attacks ends up sending Ash, Iris, {{an|Cilan}}, and Lewis flying.  Lewis\'s Gothorita, and Axew are badly damaged from the blast so everyone rushes them back to the cabin. Thankfully Lewis explains that he does have a [[Revival Herb]] which is stored in a jar. Lewis mixes it in a bowl and feeds it to both Axew and Gothorita. Immediately they are both fully healed. Axew and Gothorita make sure that they are both okay.\n\nEveryone heads outside to check how the situation is progressing. Gothorita uses {{m|Psyshock}} to help out. After some more battling between Landorus, Thundurus, and Tornadus, Landorus again asks them to stop fighting. Suddenly, three beams of light in colors of green, orange, and blue shine down on the Legendary Pokémon and enclose them in impenetrable boxes. The Legendary Pokémon use their attacks to try to break free, but to no avail. Team Rocket reveals to everyone that they are the ones responsible for destroying an important part of the shrines. Everyone becomes angry upon hearing this, and exclaims that such actions will never be forgiven. {{AP|Roggenrola}}, {{TP|Cilan|Pansage}}, and {{TP|Iris|Emolga}} are brought out to help destroy the boxes to set the Legendary Pokémon free. None of their attacks come close to breaking the boxes. Gothorita tries {{m|Shadow Ball}}, but that doesn\'t work either. Team Rocket tells them that the boxes are unbreakable. Team Rocket goes inside of their helicopter, and raises the boxes to attach to it. The Pokémon once again use their attacks, but this time on the helicopter itself and end up destroying the controls. Dr. Zager realizes that he has no choice but to release the boxes and the Legendary Pokémon. Team Rocket makes their getaway to avoid the helicopter being destroyed.\n\nAfter Team Rocket gets away, the Legendary Pokémon continue their fighting. Landorus appears to have hurt himself, and because of that Tornadus and Thundurus started really landing their attacks which really damage him. They have Landorus cornered and prepare to attack to finish him off. Meanwhile, Lewis had returned to the cabin to retrieve another Revival Herb to bring it to Landorus for healing. Gothorita uses its {{t|Psychic}} powers to send the Revival Herb to Landorus for him to be able to fully recover to avoid their attacks. Thankfully Landorus received the Revival Herb in time and was able to use Protect for protection. Lewis recalls that one of the diagrams showed the exact same scenario to help Landorus happened in the past as well. Landorus uses {{m|Hyper Beam}} on Thundurus and Tornadus, which injures them. Landorus touches them and tries to convey his feelings to them about calming down and stopping the fighting, while Gothorita does the same thing with its Psychic powers. Thundurus and Tornadus finally calm down. Sunlight falls upon the land and sea while the Legendary Pokémon begin to revive everything. Tornadus summons rain, Landorus plants the seeds, Thundurus sets fire to them causing the Revival Herb plants to sprout fully, die, and blow away to other areas. The Pokémon repeat this process. After they had finished, {{p|Lilligant}} comes to them to show that she is healthy, while all the other {{t|Grass}} Pokémon appear healthy as well. All of the forest Pokémon return to the forest, and the sea returns to normal. Lewis thanks the Legendary Pokémon for their help, and they go back to the sky.\n\nWith a bag full of Revival Herbs, Ash, Cilan, and Iris board a boat and head back to {{ci|Driftveil}} and the [[Driftveil Gym]]. They wave goodbye to Lewis as they head off.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
