Battle in the Sky!!\'\') is the 85th episode of the {{series|Advanced Generation}}, and the 359th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on July 15, 2004 and in the United States on July 9, 2005.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/07_45-sky-high-gym-battle/-->\n<i>Ash begins his Gym battle with Winona by sending out Grovyle against her Altaria. Grovyle takes out Altaria with Leaf Blade. Next up is Pelipper, a Water-and-Flying-type so Ash counters with the Electric-type Pikachu. Pelipper uses Steel Wing on the ground, and Pikachu uses Thunderbolt with no effect. Team Rocket arrives to steal Pikachu, but the force of Pikachu\'s continued Thunderbolt sends them blasting off.\n\nIt turns out that Pelipper is being grounded by its Steel Wing, making the Electric-type attack ineffective. Pelipper uses Hydro Pump, which Pikachu uses as a conduit to shock the other Pokémon. It results in a double KO.\n\nAsh sends out Grovyle again, which is then finished off by Winona\'s Swellow. Ash counters with his own Swellow. Winona\'s Pokémon has the advantage since it has more experience battling in mid-air, especially with its Aerial Ace. After taking several hits, Ash has his Swellow use Wing Attack on the ground, which gives his Swellow a chance to counterattack, knocking out Swellow and winning him the Feather Badge.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Winona]], the [[Fortree City]] [[Gym Leader]], and {{Ash}} take their places on opposing elevated platforms above the battlefield. Before the {{pkmn|battle}} commences, Winona prays to the wind, asking for strength. {{ho|Zachary}} takes his position as referee and explains the rules of the match; a three-on-three battle and only the challenger can make substitutions. Winona calls out her {{TP|Winona|Altaria}}, while Ash chooses {{AP|Grovyle}}. Watching from the sidelines, {{an|May}} examines Altaria on her [[Pokédex]] and {{an|Brock}} warns that Altaria are part {{type|Dragon}}, making for a dangerous opponent. Altaria begins the battle with a {{m|Peck}} attack, but Grovyle counters with {{m|Bullet Seed}} and then jumps out of the way, but gets pecked afterwards. Winona commands Altaria do another Peck, but Ash gets Grovyle to dodge it by climbing up a totem pole and doing a backflip. Altaria lands a direct hit with {{m|Dragon Breath}}, but Grovyle doesn\'t seem too affected by it. Winona again commands Altaria to use the same attack, but Ash gets Grovyle to jump out of the way. Winona is mildly concerned with Grovyle\'s {{stat|Speed}} as continues to evade Altaria’s Dragon Breath. Grovyle then attacks with Bullet Seed again and hits Altaria on the back, with no ill effect. Altaria resorts to ascending even higher. Despite the increased altitude, Grovyle rebounds off a pole and slashes Altaria with a {{m|Leaf Blade}}. Grovyle holds the attack, pushing the pair directly into the battlefield. When the dust has settled, Altaria lies unconscious so Grovyle is declares the winner of the round. Ash\'s friends are impressed, that despite the type disadvantage, he managed to pull through. Winona also admits that she was caught off guard by Ash’s strategy.\n\nWinona recalls Altaria and sends out {{p|Pelipper}}. Ash decides to switch out Grovyle and selects {{AP|Pikachu}}. On the sidelines, [[Max]] points out that Pelipper is a hybrid {{2t|Water|Flying}} [[type]] and Brock adds that Pikachu\'s {{t|Electric}} typing gives him the advantage. Pikachu starts off with a {{m|Thunderbolt}}, but the attack is proving ineffective as Pelipper grounds itself with {{m|Steel Wing}}. The electrical charge instead flows into the subterranean area of the [[Fortree Gym]] and electrocutes {{TRT}}, who are wandering the tunnels aimlessly in search of Pikachu. The trio are subsequently blasted onto the battlefield, and they plot to catch Pikachu while it\'s distracted by the battle. The trio recites their {{motto}} and rush towards Pikachu. However the divining rods they\'re holding again become lightning rods when Pikachu attacks. Jessie, however, is thrilled to see the rods led them directly to a treasure, Pikachu that is, as she and her teammates are blasted off into the distance. Pikachu is keeping up its Thunderbolt, but Pelipper remains unaffected. After Pelipper strikes Pikachu with {{m|Quick Attack}}, Brock comes to understand Winona’s grounding tactic. Ash changes his strategy and orders Pikachu to use Quick Attack. Pelipper is still grounded and Winona commands it to use {{m|Hydro Pump}}. The force of the attack causes Pelipper to de-ground itself and Ash sees a chance to use a {{m|Thunder}} attack on Pelipper. Both {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} are [[fainting|knocked out]]. \n\nWinona informs Ash that the day\'s perfect conditions have heightened the power of her Flying Pokémon before summoning her {{p|Swellow}}, an {{shiny|alternate color}} Pokémon, as her final Pokémon, while Ash chooses Grovyle again. Ash commands Grovyle to use Leaf Blade, though Swellow is seemingly unscathed by the swipe. Swellow is then ordered to use {{m|Aerial Ace}}, a move unfamiliar to Ash. Ash uses the jump-and-Leaf-Blade combo again as a counter move, but Swellow dodges it. Instead, Swellow lands its mark and carries Grovyle into the sky before tossing it directly into the battlefield to win the round. \n\nAsh then chooses his own {{AP|Swellow}} to battle. Winona is impressed by Ash\'s bold choice, so the two elevate their battle platforms to incredible heights for a real sky battle. The increased altitude brings a new challenge to match; unpredictable wind currents. Ash tells his Swellow to use {{m|Wing Attack}} and Brock thinks that this is a bad idea. Winona\'s Swellow strikes first, causing Ash’s Swellow to lose control of its flying as it begins to descend towards the field below. Winona orders her Swellow to repeatedly Peck Ash\'s Swellow. Then she orders a {{m|Hyper Beam}} attack, which its opponent dodges. However, she orders this attack a second time and it\'s a direct hit. Ash tells Swellow to dodge and counter with {{m|Quick Attack}} but Winona\'s Swellow is faster and dodges this attack, countering with Aerial Ace. The battle becomes an aerial chase between the two Swallow Pokémon. Ash gets some inspiration when he sees the dust being stirred on the ground by Swellow\'s rapidly changing direction in mid-air close to the ground. Winona orders another Hyper Beam. Ash orders Swellow to use Quick Attack and rush towards the ground. Winona calls for Swellow to use Aerial Ace. Ash then commands his Swellow to use Wing Attack on the ground, whipping up a disorientation dust cloud. The momentary distraction allows Ash\'s Swellow to launch a direct hit with another Wing Attack, knocking its opponent out. Zachary officially calls the match, declare Ash as the winner. Winona presents the {{Badge|Feather}} to Ash against a beautiful sunset background, admitting that the battle truly showcased the trust between Ash and his Pokémon.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:Ash Feather Badge.png|thumb|220px|Ash holding the Feather Badge]]\n* {{Ash}} has his [[Gym]] battle with [[Winona]] and wins, earning the {{badge|Feather}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* [[Winona\'s Altaria]]\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Winona]]\n* {{ho|Zachary}}\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:PTC AG085.png|thumb|200px|right|Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]\n[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]: {{p|Lapras}}\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Chimecho}} ({{OP|James|Chimecho}})\n* {{p|Swellow}} ({{OP|Ash|Swellow}})\n* {{p|Grovyle}} ({{OP|Ash|Grovyle}})\n* {{p|Altaria}} ({{OP|Winona|Altaria}})\n* {{p|Pelipper}} ([[Winona]]\'s)\n* {{p|Swellow}} ([[Winona]]\'s; {{shiny}})\n\n==Trivia==\n* This was the last episode to air before \'\'[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]\'\' debuted in Japanese theaters.\n* Due to [[Megumi Hayashibara]]\'s maternity leave, [[Akiko Hiramatsu]] takes over the voice of [[Jessie]], a change that will last for the next eight episodes. Hayashibara\'s other role, [[Brock\'s Mudkip]], is taken over by [[Natsuki Yoshihara]].\n* {{TRT}} makes a reference to \'\'[[EP142|A Shadow of a Drought]]\'\', \'\'[[EP181|A Ghost of a Chance]]\'\', and \'\'[[EP182|From Ghost to Ghost]]\'\', when they had used the divining rods/[[Dowsing Machine|itemfinder]].\n* All of the choices in the [[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]] segment would be correct, as {{p|Baltoy}} is weak to {{t|Ice}}, {{t|Water}}, {{t|Grass}}, and {{t|Bug}}, which are the featured types of the segment. Ledian could be considered to be the best choice since it would be unaffected by Baltoy\'s {{type|Ground}} attacks.\n\n===Errors===\n* When {{AP|Grovyle}} is facing off against {{TP|Winona|Altaria}}, {{Ash}} tells Grovyle to "jump and use dodge", rather than to "jump and dodge".\n** Similarly, Ash tells {{AP|Swellow}} to "use {{m|Quick Attack}} and after that use dive", rather than "use Quick Attack and dive".\n* During the second round of the battle, {{p|Pelipper}} uses {{m|Steel Wing}} as a ground to render {{AP|Pikachu}}\'s attack ineffective. In the real world, electricity is only dangerous when the target is grounded and not the other way round. This is a consistent error about electricity in the Pokémon universe. {{an|Brock}} also describes the technique as protecting Pelipper "like a lightning rod". Lightning rods act by \'\'diverting\'\' electricity into the rod and away from the building, not by acting as a ground for the building.\n* When {{TRT}} performs their {{motto}}, [[Jessie]]\'s hair end appears to be by her leg, instead of behind [[James]].\n* When Pikachu falls down after getting hit by Pelipper\'s {{m|Quick Attack}}, part of his tail is missing.\n* When Ash goes to pick up Pikachu, his platform is still raised in the background.\n* When [[Winona]] sends out her {{Shiny}} {{p|Swellow}}, sparkles do not come out of Swellow\'s {{i|Poké Ball}}.\n* In the scene where Winona\'s Swellow dodges {{AP|Grovyle}}\'s {{m|Leaf Blade}}, Grovyle appears to have a fang.\n* In the scene right before Ash\'s Swellow hits the ground with {{m|Wing Attack}}, the white aura covering its wings disappears for a split second.\n\n<gallery>\nAG085 error.png|Grovyle\'s erroneous fang\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n====[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]====\n* Question: Trainers, which one of these Pokémon is the best choice to battle {{p|Baltoy}}?\n* Choices: {{p|Lapras}}, {{p|Meganium}}, {{p|Ledian}}\n* Answer: OK, Trainers!
