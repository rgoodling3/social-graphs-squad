It was first broadcast in Japan on December 16, 1997. The episode is infamous for resulting in over seven hundred Japanese people (ranging from 3-58 years old<ref>http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9712/17/japan.cartoon/</ref>) suffering adverse health effects, including {{wp|Photosensitive epilepsy|epileptic seizures}}, vomiting, irritated eyes and other related symptoms, due to use of a flashing strobe effect upon its first and only airing. Because of that, this episode was [[Banned episodes|never commercially released or re-broadcast]] anywhere in the world, and the show went on hiatus for four months.\n\nThe frames which caused the seizures are a four-second section in which {{AP|Pikachu}} uses an {{t|Electric}} attack on a group of vaccine missiles. The explosion—which occupies a significant portion of the frame—flashes brightly and alternates rapidly between red and blue. The seizures caused by this episode resulted in [[OLM Incorporated|OLM]] dropping strobe effects from Pikachu\'s electric attacks. For years following the incident, a disclaimer was broadcast at the beginning of all Japanese television shows, cautioning viewers not to sit too close to the television screen and to watch only in a brightly-lit room. (「テレビアニメを見るときには、部屋をあかるくして近づきすぎないようにしてみてくださいね。」)\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}}, {{an|Misty}}, and {{an|Brock}} make their way to the nearest [[Pokémon Center]] in [[Matcha City]] in order to revive Ash\'s tired {{AP|Pikachu}}. There, they meet a distressed [[Nurse Joy]], who details that the [[Poké Ball]] {{pkmn|Storage System|transporter}} has been problematic — the {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} she sends never arrives at another Pokémon Center, and it was replaced by a different Pokémon. [[Dr. Akihabara]], the inventor of the Pokémon Transport System, is at the Center trying to figure out what went wrong with the system. Brock suggests that a {{wp|computer virus}} could be the source of the problem. Akihabara explains that the system couldn\'t have been infected with a virus because he designed the circuits so well. Ash confuses his explanation of a computer virus with a biological one and thinks the transport system is actually sick. Nurse Joy is told by Brock about an antivirus, which is a powerful software made to fix the problem. However, upon further investigation into the system, Akihabara unexpectedly gasps and suddenly bolts out of the Center, leaving Joy and the others confused.\n\nAsh, Misty, and Brock break into Akihabara\'s huge laboratory mansion to figure out what happened to him. Inside, they are startled by a giant holographic image of Akihabara\'s head. Ash and {{ashfr}} are led into a room with a giant machine. The doctor orders them to enter the machine, only telling them that they have entered a giant Human Transporter after he has sealed and locked the door. Akihabara then introduces the group to a {{p|Porygon}} and explains that {{TRT}} has stolen his other prototype Porygon, and are causing havoc. Team Rocket is literally inside the system and have set up a virus blocking the Poké Balls from reaching the Pokémon Centers and keeping them for themselves. Akihabara can\'t send the antivirus in there because it would kill them, so he decided to send Ash and his friends into the machine with Porygon to defeat Team Rocket. They refuse, but Akihabara starts the Human Transporter and the kids are eventually sucked into cyberspace.\n\nThe group falls into the Transporter system, but Porygon flies beneath them, grows in size, and catches them. Riding on Porygon\'s back, Ash, Misty, Brock, and Pikachu go over to confront Team Rocket, who are celebrating the success of their virus, which looks like a roadblock sign. [[Jessie]] and [[James]] send out {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}} and {{TP|James|Weezing}}; Weezing uses {{m|Poison Gas}} on them, making Ash and his friends cough. Then, Porygon regains composure and uses {{m|Conversion}}; its skin color becomes purple, like Weezing\'s. Porygon then charges, with the group still riding it, right into Weezing and Arbok, effectively [[fainting|knocking them out]].\n\nJessie decides to send their prototype Porygon out next, which looks similar to Akihabara\'s Porygon, except that it bears a "[[Team Rocket|R]]" flag on its tail and a zero on its forehead. Jessie\'s Porygon changes the shape of its head to give itself a sword-like beak and tries to attack the other Porygon, who has also changed shape to counter it. Ash and his friends decide to capitalize on the distraction to move the barrier Team Rocket built to hold back all of the Poké Balls that were intended to be delivered to the Pokémon Centers. Team\'s Rocket\'s attempt to stop them is stopped by Pikachu\'s {{m|Thunder Shock}}, and Akihabara\'s Porygon sends them and the prototype Porygon blasting off.\n\nDespite this, Akihabara, represented by a floating TV screen, warns them that Nurse Joy has followed Brock\'s instructions and hired another technician to put the antivirus program into the computer; and it indiscriminately targets everything and anything, including Team Rocket, Ash, and his friends. Trying to fix the problem himself, the doctor did not tell Nurse Joy about Team Rocket. As the antivirus targets the group, Porygon gathers Ash and his friends to attempt an escape. From the ground, Team Rocket calls Ash out for running away, but are corrected by Ash when he tells them to run from the antivirus. The antivirus then launches a few rockets that destroy the remainder of the Poké Ball barrier, thus destroying the virus. However, the vaccine keeps going! {{MTR}} and the prototype Porygon rescue a panicking Jessie and James from the moving sea of Poké Balls and join Akihabara\'s Porygon in an attempt to escape.\n[[File:EP038SeizureScenes.png|thumb|250px|Scene after Pikachu blew up the missile. For health and safety reasons, please click on the image to view the animation.]]\nThe vaccine transforms into an object that resembles a flying spaceship and takes pursuit. It launches more missiles that both of the Porygon dodge with difficulty. Inside the Center, Nurse Joy and the technician command the antivirus to unleash a powerful attack. Revealing a gigantic particle gun, it locks onto the prototype Porygon and fires a huge beam, sending Team Rocket downward into a cyberspace bug hole created by the powerful attack. The bug holes created by the antivirus\'s beam cause a system error, and Joy orders the technician not to use the attack again.\n\nTeam Rocket awakens at the bottom of one of the bug pits, and realize that their Porygon is knocked out and that they cannot escape. The flying antivirus locks onto them again, but {{AP|Bulbasaur}}\'s {{m|Vine Whip}} intervenes. Held onto Akihabara\'s Porygon by Bulbasaur, Team Rocket weighs Porygon down and slows its progress toward the exit portal. The antivirus locks onto Akihabara\'s Porygon and fires four more missiles, which it is unable to dodge. Pikachu steps in and launches a destructive {{t|Electric}} attack, detonating two of the missiles and giving Porygon just enough time to escape through the exit portal. The next two missiles hit the portal itself, destroying Akihabara\'s entire house, much to Akihabara\'s dismay, as his Human Transporter is now in pieces.\n\nIn the remains of the mansion, Ash and his friends are relieved to be back in the real world. Team Rocket spitefully thanks Ash for saving them and then quickly leaves, forgetting their prototype Porygon. Ash and his friends decide to check in on the Pokémon Center. Nurse Joy is relieved to see the Transport system working again, oblivious to the fact that Ash and his friends risked their lives to fix the system. In the end, however, Ash, Brock, and Misty decide not to tell Nurse Joy of the ordeal.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

The original schedule was as follows:\n{{Rescheduled episodes\u200e}}\n\nIn the wake of the incident, all references to Pokémon, including a [[It\'s New Year\'s Eve! Pocket Monsters Encore|new-year\'s-eve show celebrating Pokémon]] were removed from TV Tokyo\'s programming.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe incident caused by the episode was coined by the Japanese press as the [[Pokémon Shock]]. Before the series restarted, a special report was aired on April 11, 1998, titled \'\'[[Anime: Pocket Monsters Problem Inspection Report]]\'\'. In addition, an explanation aimed for children {{DL|EP039|Explanation of EP038 incident|was shown on the first episode after the incident}}. However, it has been known some children faked seizures to skip school the next day. Every Pokémon episode that aired up until this episode, including [[Aim to Be a Pokémon Master|the opening]], was edited by lighting certain scenes, removing or changing fast-flashing scenes and more. The original version of the episodes have never been shown again, except by mistake on [[Hulu|Hulu Japan]].\n\nTo avoid further controversy involving the episode\'s central plot, {{p|Porygon}} has never had an important role in another episode since, despite {{AP|Pikachu}} being the one to cause the seizure-inducing explosion. Porygon\'s evolved forms, {{p|Porygon2}} and {{p|Porygon-Z}}, also remained absent from the anime until [[M15|the fifteenth movie]], and even then only appeared in cameo roles. Porygon itself has also made cameo appearances in the first four films and \'\'[[EP047|A Chansey Operation]]\'\'. As an indirect result, its [[signature move]] {{m|Conversion}} has never been used in the anime since.\n\nThe seizures caused from this episode have infamously made the Pokémon anime a frequent reference when discussing Japanese anime and its quick action and flashy effects. Numerous television shows and movies have made parodies with [[List of Pokémon parodies|notable references]] by \'\'[https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/The_Simpsons The Simpsons]\'\' in the episode "[https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Thirty_Minutes_Over_Tokyo Thirty Minutes over Tokyo]" (as "Battling Seizure Robots" which gives the entire family seizures) and \'\'{{wp|South Park}}\'\' in the episode "{{wp|Chinpokomon}}".\n\nThis episode also gave the Pokémon anime the infamous title of "Most Photosensitive Epileptic Seizures Caused by a Television Show" from {{wp|Guinness World Records|The Guinness Book of World Records}}.\n\n==Trivia==\n<!--Please do not put down that this episode aired in Brazil. Your edit will be undone unless you provide solid evidence.-->\n* On May 21 and 26, 2006, [[Maddie Blaustein]] said on the [[Serebii.net]] forum that [[4Kids Entertainment]] did dub this episode, although the validity of this statement has been questioned.<ref>http://www.serebiiforums.com/showpost.php?p=3281064&postcount=712</ref><ref>http://www.serebiiforums.com/showpost.php?p=3309430&postcount=731</ref> On September 23, 2016, [[Eric Stuart]] also said that they did dub the episode.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/drew.s.hemmerich/videos/vb.100000054400177/1272482669430201/?type=3&theater</ref> [[Veronica Taylor]], on the other hand, initially claimed they never dubbed the episode,<ref>http://pokedream.com/pokemon/infocenter/taylor.php</ref> before saying on March 30, 2018, that she was actually unaware at the time as to whether it was dubbed or not, and that Stuart would know more about it being the voice director of the {{pkmn|anime}} at the time.<ref>https://youtu.be/5CDfQVh8bV8?t=2m52s</ref> [[Rachael Lillis]] also said she was unaware as to whether or not the episode was dubbed since decisions were made before it would be.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/drew.s.hemmerich/posts/2628502197161568</ref>\n** Contrary to rumors, neither Blaustein nor Stuart stated that 4Kids reduced the speed and intensity of the flashing explosion to make it safe.\n** The rumor about the existence of an English dub of this episode actually predates Blaustein\'s word. For example, the first answer Blaustein gave about this episode was a direct response to a user who mentioned reading on Wikipedia about the episode being dubbed: the line "4Kids Entertainment has actually dubbed Computer Soldier Porygon even though it didn\'t air" was added to the Wikipedia article currently titled {{wp|Pokémon episodes removed from rotation}} on March 15, 2006, and Bulbapedia was used as the source.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pok%C3%A9mon_episodes_removed_from_rotation&diff=next&oldid=43907788</ref>\n*** In fact, when this Bulbapedia article was created on February 27, 2005, it had the line "4 Kids Entertainment have dubbed this episode and reduced the speed and intensity of the flashing explosion to make it safe, but the episode has still never been shown".<ref>http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=EP038&oldid=5596</ref> The line has been without a source until October 28, 2007, when "According to Maddie Blaustein" was added at the beginning of the line.<ref>http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=EP038&diff=prev&oldid=160862</ref>\n* [[Fantasy in My Pocket]] replaces [[Meowth\'s Song]] as the [[List of Japanese ending themes|Japanese ending theme]].\n* [[Dr. Akihabara|Akihabara]], the name of the professor, is also the name of a {{wp|Akihabara|famous electronics district}} in {{wp|Tokyo}}.\n* [[Jessie]] and {{Ash}} refers to the two {{p|Porygon}} as 零号機 \'\'zero-gōki\'\' and 初号機 \'\'sho-gōki\'\', respectively—a likely reference to Evangelion Units 00 and 01 from {{wp|Neon Genesis Evangelion}}.\n* This episode was skipped in the anime comic adaptations [[Pocket Monsters Film Comic]] and the companion book [[TV Anime Pocket Monsters Big Bite Book]].
