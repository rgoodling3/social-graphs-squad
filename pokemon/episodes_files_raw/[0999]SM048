It first aired in Japan on November 2, 2017, in New Zealand on March 1, 2018, and in the United States on March 28, 2018.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/21_05-night-of-a-thousand-poses/-->\n<i>Our heroes are having a sleepover at Professor Kukui’s house, and Professor Burnet agrees to join them! Everyone has a good time, but there are a couple of hiccups: during a game of Z-Move poses, Kiawe accidentally unleashes Turtonator’s Inferno Overdrive in the living room, and then Professor Burnet’s Munchlax eats everything she cooked for dinner!\n\nThat night, when Lillie has trouble sleeping, she talks with Professor Burnet, who offers some advice about her family. The next day, Nebby unexpectedly whisks her away to visit her brother—and his partner, the mysterious Silvally, who leaves her terrified and apparently unable to touch Pokémon again!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAt {{an|Lillie}}\'s mansion, Lillie and [[Snowy]] are eating breakfast when [[Hobbes]] starts filming her, the former not being happy to learn that {{an|Lusamine}} asked Hobbes to film her. During a conversation with Lusamine, her phone rings and Lillie becomes annoyed at her for being distracted with work, and leaves for a walk. Over at {{an|Professor Kukui}}\'s house, while [[Professor Burnet]] finishes her tests on {{DL|Light trio (anime)|Solgaleo|Nebby}}, {{Ash}} opens the door to {{ashcl}} who have come for a sleepover. They ask Professor Burnet to stay and join them for their sleepover, which she accepts. They decide to have a contest to choose who will sleep in the loft where Ash usually sleeps, the contest being that the first team to find and catch Nebby wins. However, Nebby proves hard to find, as it keeps using {{m|Teleport}} whenever it\'s spotted, but eventually, Lillie finds Nebby under her hat, which means the girls have won and they can sleep in the loft.\n\nAfter deciding where everyone sleeps, everyone decides to play another game. {{an|Rotom Pokédex}} has a slot machine function, and after every spin, the icons indicate which [[Z-Move]] pose to act out. The game continues with players losing if they fail to make the correct poses, or fail to say the name of the Z-Move in case all the shown symbols are the same. The game soon ends when {{an|Kiawe}} and {{TP|Kiawe|Turtonator}} accidentally unleash {{m|Inferno Overdrive}}. After cleaning up, Professor Burnet starts on dinner with Lillie, Ash, and {{an|Mallow}} helping out. After the room has been tidied up, the others devide to watch [[television|TV]], but start arguing over what to watch before deciding on [[Baseball|Pokémon Base]]. Dinner is soon ready, but before anyone can even react, Burnet\'s {{p|Munchlax}} eats all of it. Whilst Professor Kukui and Professor Burnet are out getting more food, Ash and friends head out to do some training on the beach.\n\nSoon, Professor Kukui and Professor Burnet arrive home and prepare the new food. Before going to bed, they all talk about their families, which leaves Lillie thinking about Lusamine and {{an|Gladion}}. When everyone goes to sleep, Lillie has trouble sleeping, so she heads out to the beach with Snowy and is later joined by Professor Burnet. They discuss Lusamine\'s time-consuming workload and Professor Burnet assures Lillie that Lusamine is thinking about her all the time. \n\nThe next morning, Ash accompanies his classmates as they head home. Lillie thinks to herself that she wishes she could speak with Gladion, causing Nebby to teleport her to a cave where she encounters him. Their meeting is interrupted when {{p|Type: Null}} senses danger and jumps toward Lillie, causing her to recall past memories of {{TP|Gladion|Silvally}} jumping at her as a child. Lillie becomes frightened and before Gladion can reach Lillie, Nebby teleports Lillie back to the others. When she comes back, Lillie and the group notice she can no longer touch any Pokémon, not even Snowy.\n\nLater, back at Professor Kukui\'s house, {{an|Rotom Pokédex}} is seen practicing the poses, while Ash eats curry. The curry is too spicy for Ash, causing him to guzzle down water, shouting "Water! Water! Fyaaah!" {{an|Rotom Pokédex}} does the pose for {{t|Water}}, but doesn\'t know what pose it\'s supposed to do for "Fyaaah!"\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode. Only events pertaining to the series as a whole, such as catching and releasing Pokémon and obtaining Badges, go here. -->\n* {{an|Lillie}} becomes unable to touch any Pokémon again after encountering [[Gladion\'s Silvally]].\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n[[File:Dare da SM048.png|thumb|200px|{{tt|Dare da?|Who\'s That Pokémon?}}]]\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Lana}}\n* {{an|Kiawe}}\n* {{an|Lillie}}\n* {{an|Sophocles}}\n* {{an|Mallow}}\n* {{an|Professor Oak}} (on television)\n* {{an|Professor Kukui}}\n* {{an|Gladion}}\n* {{an|Lusamine}}\n* [[Hobbes]]\n* [[Professor Burnet]]\n* [[Laki]] (on television)\n* [[Oluolu]] (on television)\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP SM048.png|thumb|200px|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Steenee}} \'\'(US and international)\'\', {{p|Munchlax}} \'\'(Japan)\'\'\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Rotom}} ({{an|Rotom Pokédex}})\n* {{p|Rowlet}} ({{OP|Ash|Rowlet}})\n* {{p|Lycanroc}} ({{OP|Ash|Lycanroc}}; {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Lycanroc|Dusk Form}})\n* {{p|Litten}} ({{OP|Ash|Litten}})\n* {{p|Popplio}} ({{OP|Lana|Popplio}})\n* {{p|Turtonator}} ({{OP|Kiawe|Turtonator}})\n* {{p|Marowak}} ({{OP|Kiawe|Marowak}}; [[Regional variant|Alola Form]])\n* {{p|Vulpix}} ({{an|Lillie}}\'s; [[Regional variant|Alola Form]]; [[Snowy]])\n* {{p|Togedemaru}} ({{OP|Sophocles|Togedemaru}})\n* {{p|Charjabug}} ({{OP|Sophocles|Charjabug}})\n* {{p|Steenee}} ({{OP|Mallow|Steenee}})\n* {{p|Eevee}} ({{an|Gladion}}\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Type: Null}} ({{OP|Gladion|Type: Null}}; Silvally)\n* {{p|Cleffa}} ({{OP|Lusamine|Cleffa}}; flashback and picture)\n* {{p|Lillipup}} ({{an|Lusamine}}\'s; picture)\n* {{p|Munchlax}} ([[Professor Burnet]]\'s)\n* {{p|Smeargle}} ([[Laki]]\'s; on television)\n* {{p|Snorlax}} ([[Oluolu]]\'s; on television)\n* {{p|Cosmog}} ({{DL|Light trio (anime)|Solgaleo|Nebby}})\n* {{p|Luvdisc}} (×2)\n* {{p|Corsola}}\n* {{p|Lilligant}} (picture)\n* {{p|Milotic}} (on television)\n* {{p|Electabuzz}} (on television)\n* {{p|Scrafty}} (on television)\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[Poké Problem]]: \'\'Which house does the sleepover party take place?\'\'\n** Host: {{Rotom}}\n** Choices: {{an|Professor Kukui}}\'s house, {{an|Kiawe}}\'s house, {{an|Lana}}\'s house, {{an|Sophocles}}\'s house\n** Answer: Professor Kukui\'s house\n* [[Jessie]], {{MTR}}, [[James]], and {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} narrate the preview for the [[SM049|next episode]].\n* This is the final episode of the series to feature [[Unshō Ishizuka]] as the Japanese voice of {{an|Professor Oak}} prior to his death in 2018.\n* The English dub title may be a reference to the song "On This Night of a Thousand Stars".\n* The {{pmin|France|French}} and {{pmin|Italy|Italian}} dub titles are a reference to the Middle Eastern story collection \'\'{{wp|One Thousand and One Nights}}\'\'.\n* This is the only episode within the span between \'\'[[SM045|Now You See Them, Now You Don\'t!]]\'\' and \'\'[[SM055|The Professors\' New Adventure!]]\'\' in which {{an|Lillie}} does not do a {{wp|First-person narrative|first-person narration}}.\n** On another note, this is the very first episode of the main series to lack any kind of narration; neither the usual [[narrator]] nor a first-person narration by a character.\n\n===Errors===\n\n===Dub edits===\n* The Japanese text depicting {{m|Inferno Overdrive}} and {{m|Pulverizing Pancake}}\'s names is edited out in the dub.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=90BDDC|bordercolor=F1912B\n|zh_cmn={{tt|以全力姿勢舉辦過夜派對！|Full Force Pose at the Sleepover!}}\n|cs={{tt|Večer tisíce póz!|An evening of a thousand poses!}}\n|da={{tt|De tusind positurers nat!|The thousand poses\' night!}}\n|fi={{tt|Tuhannen poseerauksen yö!|Night of thousand poses!}}\n|nl={{tt|De nacht van de duizend poses!|The night of the thousand poses!}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Les mille et une poses !|One thousand and one poses!}}\n|de={{tt|Die Nacht der tausend Posen!|The night of a thousand poses!}}\n|it={{tt|Le mille e una posa!|One thousand and one poses!}}\n|ko={{tt|전력포즈로 파자마 파티!|The Pajama Party with Full Force!}}\n|no={{tt|En minneverdig overnatting!|A memorable sleepover!}}\n|pl={{tt|Noc tysiąca póz!|The night of the thousand poses!}}\n|pt_br={{tt|A noite das mil poses!|The night of the thousand poses!}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Noite das mil poses!|Night of the thousand poses!}}\n|he={{tt|!לילה של אלף תנוחות|Night of A Thousand Poses!}}\n|ru={{tt|Ночь тысячи движений!|Night of a thousand movements!}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡La noche de las mil poses!|The night of the thousand poses!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|¡La noche de las mil poses!|The night of the thousand poses!}}\n|sv={{tt|En Övernattning Att Minnas!|A Sleepover To Remember!}}\n|th={{tt|ไปค้างบ้านเพื่อนโพสท่าสุดกำลัง!|Full Force Pose at the Sleepover!}}\n|tr={{tt|Binlerce Pozla Dolu Bir Gece!|A Night Full Of Thousands of Poses!}}\n}}\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=SM047 |\nprevtitle=A Masked Warning!
