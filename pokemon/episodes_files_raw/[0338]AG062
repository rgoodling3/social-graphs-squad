His father let him go, and confronts the mother when she comes to check on Timmy.\n\nJessie is competing under an alias in the Contest, and her Dustox takes the lead in the first round. May\'s Skitty fails to do a Blizzard attack, losing points and putting May behind. May still progresses to the second round. \n\nIn the second round May quickly dispatches her opponent, while Phantom beats Jessie in a tough battle. Jessie\'s disguise is blown off, and after losing she decides to try to steal Phantom\'s Dusclops instead. Pikachu sends them flying with Thunderbolt, also ripping off Timmy\'s mask.\n\nMeanwhile, Timmy\'s father talks to his wife and brings up the fact that she only hates Pokémon because her parents took her beloved Poochyena away from her when she was a child. She relents and decides to cheer Timmy on at the Contest.\n\nMay and Timmy face off in the final round, and Skitty isn\'t doing so well until May instructs it to use Assist. Skitty quickly catches up and beats Dusclops. Timmy\'s mother encourages him to continue competing.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[Verdanturf Town]] [[Pokémon Contest]] is about to begin and once again {{an|May}} is nervous. This is the first time she will be entering with {{TP|May|Skitty}}. Out in the lobby, {{Ash}} is worried because [[Timmy Grimm|Timmy]] is soon going to be too late to register for the competition, but thankfully he shows up just in time. Hiding nearby, {{TRT}} makes fun of Timmy for being late, since even they were able to register on time. [[Jessie]] continues to be confident that she and her {{TP|Jessie|Dustox}} will win. It later turns out that [[Mrs. Grimm|Timmy\'s mother]] was forcing him to do a lot of homework. Thankfully his father, [[Tommy Grimm]], helped him to sneak away to the [[Contest Hall]]. At home, Timmy\'s mother finds him gone, and Tommy openly states that their son has left to compete in the Verdanturf Contest.\n\nThe [[Appeal|Appeals Round]] begins with [[Jessie]] in [[List of Team Rocket\'s disguises|disguise]] as "Jesslana". Her {{TP|Jessie|Dustox}} uses {{m|Poison Sting}}, {{m|Whirlwind}}, and {{m|Psybeam}} together with impressive effect, earning a high score of 28.5 from the [[Contest Judge]]s. Following a {{p|Charizard}} and a {{p|Blastoise}}, May takes the stage with {{TP|May|Skitty}}. Unfortunately their opening [[move]], {{m|Blizzard}}, fails, so May tries to make up for it with Skitty using {{m|Double Slap}} to juggle. This works relatively well, earning her a score of 24.9. Next is Timmy in his Phantom disguise with {{p|Dusclops}}. Dusclops uses {{m|Will-O-Wisp}} and {{m|Psychic}} together to dazzle the judges and earn himself a 27.8. When the results are announced, it is revealed that May, Timmy, Jessie, and a Coordinator by the name of [[Stefano]] have advanced to the [[Contest Battle]]s. Meanwhile, Timmy\'s parents are on their way to the Contest Hall, with Mrs. Grimm enraged that her husband would let Timmy go to a Pokémon Contest. Tommy defends his actions, saying it\'s what Timmy loves to do. Mrs. Grimm says {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} are a waste of time, but Tommy reminds her of her own involvement with Pokémon when she was Timmy\'s age.\n\nBack at the Contest Hall, the second round starts with {{an|May}} versus Stefano and his {{p|Wartortle}}, who loses in a matter of seconds. Jessie and Timmy then face off just as Timmy\'s parents arrive at the Contest Hall. Jessie\'s Dustox opens with a Whirlwind, which Dusclops counters with {{m|Shadow Punch}}. Dustox tries a {{m|Psybeam}} with much greater effect. Dustox uses Psybeam again, but this time Dusclops stops it with Psychic, causing an explosion which exposes Jessie\'s disguise. The timer stops and the judges determine that Timmy is the winner of the battle, so Team Rocket tries to steal Dusclops. {{AP|Pikachu}} easily stops this with a {{m|Thunderbolt}}, sending Team Rocket blasting off. The explosion from the Thunderbolt causes Timmy\'s Phantom mask to come off, and Timmy suddenly notices that his parents are there. Much to Timmy\'s surprise, Mrs. Grimm apologizes and walks off. Later, backstage Tommy explains that when Mrs. Grimm was Tommy\'s age, she loved Pokémon too, but she was expected to take over her parents\' business, so "childish" things such as her {{p|Poochyena}} were taken away. Her parents forbade any further contact with Pokémon. Mrs. Grimm thought that if Timmy wasn\'t allowed to play with any Pokémon, then he wouldn\'t have his heart broken like hers was. Tommy encourages his son to make the most of this chance he has in the Contest, and the final round begins.\n\nTimmy\'s Dusclops starts off with a {{m|Focus Punch}}, striking May\'s Skitty. Skitty tries a Double Slap, but as a {{type|Normal}} attack, it doesn\'t affect the {{type|Ghost}} Dusclops. Dusclops uses another Focus Punch, but this time Skitty successfully counters with Double Slap, sending the Focus Punch back. Dusclops next uses Will-O-Wisp in combination with Psychic to further damage Skitty. Skitty tries a {{m|Tackle}} attack, but Dusclops counters with {{m|Hyper Beam}}. {{TP|May|Skitty}} attempts a {{m|Blizzard}}, but the move fails again. Dusclops uses another Hyper Beam to damage Skitty again. Meaning to end the battle, Dusclops uses one more Hyper Beam, but May refuses to give up, this time having Skitty use {{m|Assist}}. The Assist creates a {{m|Gust}} which perfectly defends against the oncoming Hyper Beam. This defense evens out the score between the two contestants. Dusclops tries again to end the round, this time with Focus Punch, but Skitty counters with Assist again, creating a {{m|String Shot}} to stop the move.\n\nOn the sidelines, Timmy\'s mother is back and now encourages Timmy to win. Timmy now has enough confidence to battle without his Phantom mask. Giving it his all, Timmy has Dusclops use {{m|Will-O-Wisp}}. Skitty again counters with Assist, producing an {{m|Ember}} that stops Dusclops\' attack. With another Assist, Skitty attacks with {{m|Silver Wind}}, but Dusclops stops it with Psychic. Dusclops again uses Hyper Beam. May decides to have absolute faith in her Skitty, and tells it to try Blizzard again. This time it works, and knocks Dusclops to the ground in defeat, making May the winner of the Pokémon Contest. [[Drew]], who watched the Contest from the stands, is mildly impressed by May\'s victory over Phantom. Afterwards, Mrs. Grimm decides to allow Timmy to continue entering Pokémon Contests as long as he does not fall behind on his homework, and May receives the orange Verdanturf [[Ribbon]], her second Contest Ribbon overall.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:May Verdanturf Ribbon.png|thumb|220px|May holding the Verdanturf Ribbon]]\n* {{an|May}} wins the {{to|Verdanturf}} {{pkmn|Contest}}, earning her second [[Ribbon]].\n* [[May\'s Skitty]] masters {{m|Blizzard}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* [[Drew]]\n* [[Timmy Grimm]]\n* [[Tommy Grimm]]\n* [[Mrs. Grimm]]\n* [[Vivian Meridian]]\n* [[Raoul Contesta]]\n* [[Mr. Sukizo]]\n* [[Stefano]]\n* {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:PTC AG062.png|thumb|200px|right|Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]\n[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]: {{p|Spheal}}\n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Skitty}} ({{OP|May|Skitty}})\n* {{p|Dustox}} ({{OP|Jessie|Dustox}})\n* {{p|Dusclops}} (The Phantom/[[Timmy Grimm]]\'s)\n* {{p|Poochyena}} ([[Mrs. Grimm]]\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Wartortle}} ([[Stefano]]\'s)\n* {{p|Charizard}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Blastoise}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Vulpix}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Marill}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Poochyena}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Spinda}} (Coordinator\'s)\n\n==Trivia==\n* The title is a pun of the saying "\'\'the sky\'s the limit\'\'".\n\n===Errors===\n* The [[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]] segment claims that {{p|Spheal}} would be the best choice to battle {{p|Wooper}} due to {{type|Ice}}s being super-effective against {{type|Ground}}s.
