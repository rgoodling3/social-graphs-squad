As Todd and our friends catch up, a frozen Sunkern falls from the sky. The gang take it to a nearby lodge and, with the help of the old woman who runs it, thaw poor Sunkern out. The old woman explains she and her husband go to a valley with hundreds of Sunflora (the evolution of Sunkern) every year on their anniversary and have their picture taken. Tragically, this being their 50th wedding anniversary, they won\'t be able to continue the tradition because all of the Sunflora have disappeared. Where have all the Sunflora gone?</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} continue walking towards [[Olivine City]]. {{an|Misty}} hones into an odd sound, as predicted by {{an|Brock}} it\'s the shutter of a camera, which leads the group to their old friend and photographer extraordinaire, {{Todd}}. The group are pleasantly surprised and Todd goes on to show the group several of his latest photographs, some candid shots of various {{t|Grass}} Pokémon. Todd admits that he is now hoping to get a close up of the [[legendary Pokémon]], {{p|Articuno}}. Their reunion is cut short, however, when an object falls directly for them. Todd is keen to get a snapshot, but Ash pushes him out of the way as the chunk of solid ice hits the ground. The group examines the object, Ash\'s [[Pokédex]] reveals that the Pokémon frozen inside is a {{p|Sunkern}}. Brock wraps it up in some cloth, and the group rushes it over to a lodge that Todd had passed by earlier.\n\nAt the lodge, they are greeted by an old lady named [[Sophia]], who suggests that Brock can put the Sunkern into a basin of hot water to melt the ice. After a while the ice melts, and Sunkern comes back to life. She then mentions that the lodge is named the [[Sunflora Lodge]], and starts to explain the long, old story behind the naming of the lodge; insisting that the group listens, though they initially find it boring. As she starts her story, the group learns that it is actually a sweet but pitiful love story that takes place about 50 years ago between her and her lover, [[Marcello]]. Her lover, now her husband Marcello then appears and reveals that it was only some fictitious story that Sophia had cooked up that involved the both of them. She then proceeds to show them her photo album that contains 49 pictures that they had taken with the hundreds of {{p|Sunflora}} that came to the slope every year on their anniversary. Brock claims that this year would then be their golden anniversary and that the 50th picture would make a special one. Todd offers to take the 50th anniversary on the elderly couple\'s behalf. Marcello sighs and explains that there wouldn\'t be one as the weather is unusually cold this year and none of the {{p|Sunflora}} have appeared. Sophia is still keen to take the photograph, with or without the Sunflora, and Marcello agrees to keep the tradition going. Soon the couple leads Todd and the others to the south slope, and Brock decides to bring Sunkern with them in the hopes of finding out what has happened to the Sunflora.\n\nA powdering of snow falls on the group as they look at the rather desolate south slope. This leads Sophia to tell the group another one of her fictional love stories, this one is about the time she nearly fell off a rope bridge, but Marcello manages to lift her to safety. Brock then realizes that they never crossed a bridge, and Sophia confirms that the story was another imagining. The source of the snow fall is soon revealed to be one of [[Team Rocket\'s mechas]], and soon the thieving trio make their entrance on skis. Todd is surprised to see the [[Team Rocket trio]] still following Ash\'s group, and they are quick to insult him. {{MTR}} presses a button on his controller, and the snow machine begins to blow a blizzard directly at the group. The blizzard conditions leads Sophia into another one of her stories, though Misty interrupts to point out that they are currently under attack. The snow soon buries everyone, leaving {{AP|Pikachu}} and later {{AP|Bulbasaur}} feeling too cold to {{pkmn|battle}}. Jessie calls out her {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}}, and it slithers across and carries Pikachu to its {{pkmn|Trainer}}. Sunkern jumps into action and uses {{m|Sunny Day}} to melt the snow. The warmer conditions frees Bulbasaur from the ice, and it goes on to use {{m|Solar Beam}}, which destroys the snow blower. In the middle of fleeing, Arbok loses its hold of Pikachu, who then lands at Ash\'s feet. Team Rocket are determined to escape another humiliating blast off and climb aboard their Meowth balloon. Pikachu, however, still manages to send them blasting off with a {{m|Thunderbolt}}. \n\nThe couple are still set on taking their anniversary picture, and agree to pose with Sunkern because it is the pre-evolved form of Sunflora. Brock then suggests to Ash that he should evolve the Sunkern into a Sunflora with the [[Sun Stone]] [[EP161|he won]] as a prize in the [[Bug-Catching Contest]]. Ash agrees to the idea and places his Sun Stone by Sunkern, and it then evolves into a Sunflora. The newly-evolved Sunflora goes on to call many other Sunflora, and soon the landscape is transformed into a flowering yellow garden. Todd proceeds to take Sophia and Marcello\'s 50th anniversary photo. As he moves the camera lens away from his eye, he spots a blue figure in the distance. Todd is adamant that he saw an Articuno. With that, Ash, Misty, Brock and Todd wave goodbye to the elderly couple and head towards the mountains.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} meet up with [[Todd Snap]], who is looking to get a photo of {{p|Articuno}}.\n* Ash uses his [[Sun Stone]] to evolve a wild {{p|Sunkern}} into {{p|Sunflora}}.\n* Todd joins the group again.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Sunkern}}\n\n=====TV episode debuts=====\n* {{p|Articuno}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n[[File:Dare da EP187.png|200px|thumb|right|{{tt|Dare da?|Who\'s That Pokémon?}}]]\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Todd Snap]]\n* [[Sophia]]\n* [[Marcello]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP EP187.png|thumb|200px|right|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Pineco}} \'\'(US and international)\'\', {{p|Sunkern}} \'\'(Japan)\'\'\n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Togepi}} ({{OP|Misty|Togepi}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Bulbasaur}} ({{OP|Ash|Bulbasaur}})\n* {{p|Arbok}} ({{OP|Jessie|Arbok}})\n* {{p|Sunkern}} (evolves; debut)\n* {{p|Sunflora}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Articuno}} ({{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Articuno|anime}})\n{{-}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* This is the last episode where a pan-out was displayed with the "To be Continued" caption following it.\n* This episode marks one of the few times that an [[item]] is described by the [[Pokédex]].\n** Other items are the [[Poké Flute]] in \'\'[[EP041|Wake Up Snorlax!]]\'\' and the [[Salveyo weed]] in \'\'[[EP110|The Stun Spore Detour]]\'\'.\n* This episode marks the first and currently only time that Ash uses an evolutionary stone to make a Pokémon evolve.\n** It also marks the first time that an item belonging to Ash is used to induce a Pokémon\'s evolution.\n* Both this episode and \'\'[[EP185|The Light Fantastic]]\'\' share their names with {{wp|Discworld}} books. Interestingly, they are only two episodes apart from each other.\n* This episode references music in the real-world:\n** The episode\'s English title is also the name of an {{wp|Moving Pictures (album)|album}} by the band {{wp|Rush (band)|Rush}}.\n** The story of the Sunflora Lodge is based on a {{wp|Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree|song}} by {{wp|Tony Orlando and Dawn}}.\n* The first story which [[Sophia]] tells to Ash and {{ashfr}} is a reference to the movie \'\'{{wp|Sunflower (1970 film)|Sunflower}}\'\', which stars {{wp|Sophia Loren}} and {{wp|Marcello Mastroianni}}, who are the inspiration for [[Sophia]] and [[Marcello]] respectively. The user of {{p|Sunflora}} in this episode is also an homage to the film.\n\n===Errors===\n* In the dub, the Pokédex says that the Sun Stone is used to evolve {{p|Gloom}} into {{p|Vileplume}}. While the Sun Stone will induce evolution in a Gloom, it will become a {{p|Bellossom}}, rather than a Vileplume. The [[Leaf Stone]] is the item used to make a Gloom a Vileplume.\n* When Todd is taking pictures of {{p|Wobbuffet}}, he\'s holding up his right arm. But after he zooms out of his camera, Wobbuffet is holding up his left arm.\n* In the {{pmin|Poland|Polish}} dub, [[Sophia]] says that the picture was taken fifteen years ago.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[Todd Snap]] was named as Todd again due to legal issues involving {{wp|Kellogg Company|Kellogg\'s}}. \n* While Ash, Misty and Todd think about how long [[Sophia]]\'s story will be, Brock wonders about if she has any {{wp|string cheese}}. The reason for this is probably for comic effect.\n* The original airing of this episode on Hungama TV in {{pmin|India}} started the episode directly from the title card, skipping the part of the episode that comes before it.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|bg={{tt|Вълнуващи снимки|Exciting pictures}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|冰凍向日種子之謎！|Mystery of the Frozen Sunkern!}}\n|cs={{tt|Cesta za fotkou|Journey for the photo}}\n|nl={{tt|Ontroerende Plaatjes|Moving Pictures}}\n|de={{tt|Bewegende Bilder|Moving pictures}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|La photo de mariage|The photograph of marriage}}\n|he=אופרת קרח{{tt|operat hakerakh|The Ice Opera}}\n|it={{tt|Nozze d\'oro|Golden wedding}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Visita ao Vale do Sol|Visit to the Sun Valley}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Las fotos del Recuerdo!|The rememberance photos!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Fotos de amor|Pictures of love}}\n|pl={{tt|Ruchome obrazy|Moving pictures}}\n|hi=पिक्चर की कहानी {{tt|\'\'Picture ki kahani\'\'|The story of the Picture}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n}}\n\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP186 |\nprevtitle=UnBEARable |\nnextcode=EP188 |\nnexttitle=Spring Fever |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Johto | }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0187}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|187]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Junki Takegami]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Osamu Inoue]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Shigeru Ōmachi]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Yūsaku Takeda]]\n\n[[de:Bewegende Bilder]]\n[[es:EP189]]\n[[fr:EP187]]\n[[it:EP187]]\n[[ja:無印編第187話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第188集]]'}
