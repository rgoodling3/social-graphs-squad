Sky Battle!!\'\') is the 131st episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on January 20, 2000 and in the United States on December 16, 2000.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/03_26-fighting-flyer-with-fire/-->\n<i>With Pikachu\'s help, Ash is confident that winning the Zephyr badge will be a breeze. But when the Gym Leader\'s high-level Pokémon turn the tables on the textbook Electric over Flying advantage, Ash will have to use more than raw power to emerge victorious.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{an|Misty}} and her friends reach the [[Violet Gym]], and {{Ash}} is anxious to get his first [[Johto]] [[Badge]]. However, before they are able to go inside, [[Jessie]] and [[James]] appear, [[List of Team Rocket\'s disguises|disguised]] as surveyors from the Pokémon Bureau, and demand that they inspect every {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} before anyone can enter. They take {{AP|Pikachu}} and then escape with him in their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|Meowth balloon]], revealing their true identities. Ash commands Pikachu to use {{m|Thunder Shock}}, but the attack fails because he is in an electric-proof glass case.\n\nAsh sends out {{AP|Heracross}} to save Pikachu, but {{MTR}} drops a jar of sap to distract Heracross. Then, Ash and {{ashfr}} notice someone hang-gliding next to {{TRT}}\'s balloon. The hang-glider signals his {{p|Hoothoot}} to take Pikachu; it grabs Pikachu\'s case with its talons and flies back to its {{pkmn|Trainer}}. With Pikachu in hand, the hang-glider begins his descent, but Jessie has {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}} use {{m|Poison Sting}} to poke holes in his sail. The hang-glider leaps and sends out his {{p|Pidgeot}} to save him from falling. The pair makes their way towards Team Rocket, evading another of Arbok\'s Poison Stings before puncturing the hot-air balloon.\n\nAfter Team Rocket has blasted off, the hang-glider finally lands and gives Pikachu back to Ash. The hang-glider mentions his love of riding on {{t|Flying}} Pokémon and reveals that they are his favorite [[type]]. {{an|Brock}} asks why he loves them so much, and he responds that it was because he has always wanted to fly since he was a little boy. Then, he says he learned how to hang-glide in order to understand his Pokémon better. Ash introduces himself, and the hang-glider introduces himself as [[Falkner]], the [[Violet City]] [[Gym Leader]].\n\nFalkner escorts Ash and his friends to the Violet [[Gym]], and after a short elevator ride, they reach the Gym\'s rooftop battlefield. Ash and Falkner take their positions, and the [[Battle judge|referee]] explains that each Trainer can use three Pokémon. Once the match begins, Falkner starts with Hoothoot, and Ash sends out {{AP|Chikorita}}. Falkner scolds Ash for sending out a Pokémon that is weak to Flying Pokémon, but Ash defends himself by saying that not everyone should judge by type. Chikorita starts out with a {{m|Vine Whip}}, but Hoothoot dodges it by {{m|fly}}ing into the sky. Chikorita still tries hitting Hoothoot, but Hoothoot attacks Chikorita with {{m|Peck}}. Chikorita uses {{m|Razor Leaf}}, but Hoothoot dodges and knocks Chikorita out with {{m|Tackle}}.\n\nAsh decides to use Pikachu next. Pikachu uses {{m|Agility}} in order to avoid getting tackled. Hoothoot is struck down by Pikachu\'s {{m|Thunderbolt}} and finished off with {{m|Quick Attack}}. Falkner then sends out his {{p|Dodrio}} and mentions that no challenger has ever defeated it. Both Pikachu and Dodrio start off the match by using Agility. Although Pikachu tries using Thunderbolt, Dodrio dodges it by jumping up high. Dodrio then attacks Pikachu with {{m|Fury Attack}} and {{m|Drill Peck}}. While Dodrio is building up its {{m|Tri Attack}}, Pikachu bounces off the center Dodrio\'s head and into the air. Dodrio is startled and loses its [[move]], after which Pikachu defeats it with {{m|Thunder}}.\n\nFalkner sends out his last Pokémon, Pidgeot. Despite Pikachu\'s exhaustion, he is still willing to fight. Pikachu starts the match with Thunderbolt, but Pidgeot easily dodges it by flying. Pidgeot then defeats Pikachu with {{m|Whirlwind}}. Ash then sends {{AP|Charizard}} out. Both Charizard and Pidgeot are told to fly into the air, then Ash tells Charizard to use {{m|Flamethrower}}, but Pidgeot dodges. Charizard consistently uses Flamethrower and Pidgeot uses Agility to get out of the way. Pidgeot then uses Whirlwind to hit Charizard with its own Flamethrower, sending it back to the ground. Pidgeot approaches with a {{m|Wing Attack}}, and Ash commands Charizard to fly, but its wing is hurt. Pidgeot lands a direct hit, knocking Charizard to the ground again. Charizard is also hit with a Quick Attack, which leaves Ash wondering what he should do. Falkner tells him to forfeit, but Ash refuses to.\n\nCharizard soon becomes strong enough to fly and dodges a Quick Attack. Pidgeot uses its Agility to appear behind Charizard, and it strikes Charizard with a follow-up Quick Attack. This happens again, but Charizard doesn\'t give up. Charizard then flies behind Pidgeot, and when Pidgeot disappears and then reappears behind Charizard, Charizard turns around and surrounds it with {{m|Fire Spin}}. Charizard then finishes off Pidgeot by using {{m|Seismic Toss}}, giving Ash the win.\n\nFalkner presents Ash with the {{Badge|Zephyr}} and admits that he has been inspired to work more and train harder. He also wishes Ash luck in the [[Johto League]]. Ash, Misty, and Brock then bid farewell to Falkner. Meanwhile, Team Rocket is trapped inside their deflated balloon while being pecked by an angry [[horde]] of {{p|Spearow}} and {{p|Fearow}}.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

Both also feature either a {{type|Fire}} or a {{type|Flying}}.\n* When {{AP|Pikachu}} tries unsuccessfully to electrocute {{TRT}}, [[Jessie]] says, "Go ahead, shock around the clock if you\'d like!" This is a reference to the famous {{wp|rock and roll}} song {{wp|Rock Around the Clock}}.\n* [[Falkner]] says almost exactly the same thing about people underestimating Flying types in this episode and when the player character challenges him in the games.\n* The book [[Battle for the Zephyr Badge]] is based on this episode.\n* This episode ends in almost the same way as \'\'[[EP081|Pallet Party Panic]]\'\', with Team Rocket being {{m|Peck|peck}}ed by a group of {{p|Spearow}}. Coincidentally, the events of the episode are brought up, with Ash talking about his Pidgeot.\n* {{MTR}} [[breaking the fourth wall|breaks the fourth wall]] when he mentions that it was a bad ending.\n* This is the only episode where the move {{m|Fly}} is referred as an [[move|attack]], as {{Ash}} tells {{AP|Charizard}} to use "Fly attack".\n* This episode was [[banned episodes|banned]] in {{pmin|South Korea}}, likely due to Falkner\'s traditional Japanese-style clothing.\n\n===Errors===\n* Ash says that his {{AP|Pidgeot}} was protecting a flock of fellow {{p|Pidgeot}}, when it was actually protecting a flock of {{p|Pidgey}} and {{p|Pidgeotto}}.\n* Falkner\'s {{p|Hoothoot}} is seen with both feet on the ground in its standoff against Pikachu.\n* Pidgeot knocks Pikachu out with {{m|Whirlwind}}, despite the fact that Whirlwind is a [[status move]]. This is an example of [[anime physics]].\n* In the {{pmin|Finland|Finnish}} dub, Pidgeot was incorrectly referred as Pidgeotto through the whole episode.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[Pokémon Karaokémon]]: [[Two Perfect Girls]]\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|bg={{tt|Да отвърнеш на атаката с огън|To turn the fire attack}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|桔梗道館，空中大戰|Jiégěng (Violet) Gym, Sky Battle}}\n|cs={{tt|Zápas v letu|A match in flight}}\n|de={{tt|Kampf um den Flügelorden|Fight for the Zephyr Badge}}\n|nl={{tt|Bevecht een Vlieger met Vuur|Fight a flyer with fire}}\n|fi={{tt|Taistelu ilmojen herruudesta!|Battle for the mastership of the skies!}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|L\'air contre le feu|Air counters fire}}\n|he=קרב הציפורים{{tt|krav hatsiporim|The bird battle}}\n|hi=आग का मुकाबला हवा से {{tt|\'\'Aag ka muqabla Hava se\'\'|The battle of Fire with Air/Wind}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n|hu={{tt|Harc a madár Pokémonokkal|Fighting with bird Pokémon}}\n|it={{tt|Un incontro importante|An important match}}{{tt|*|Original 2000 dub}}<br>{{tt|Aria contro fuoco|Air against fire}}{{tt|*|2014 K2 TV dub}}\n|pl={{tt|Między ogniem a powietrzem|Between the fire and the air}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Ash Ganha a Insígnia Zefir|Ash Gets the Zephyr Badge}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Lutar com Fogo Contra Voadores|Fighting Flying Types with Fire}}\n|ro={{tt|Lupta contra Zburătorului cu Foc|The Fight against Flyer with Fire}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Combatiendo al volador con fuego!|Fighting the flying with fire!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Combatiendo al volador con fuego|Fighting the flying with fire}}\n|sv={{tt|Eldstrid|Gunfight (literally firebattle)}}\n}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP130 |\nprevtitle=A Bout With Sprout |\nnextcode=EP132 |\nnexttitle=For Crying Out Loud |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Johto | }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0131}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|131]]\n[[Category:Banned episodes]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Shōji Yonemura]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Yoshitaka Fujimoto]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Toshiaki Suzuki]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Izumi Shimura]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Ash]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which Ash gets a Badge]]\n[[Category:Episodes with Gym battles]]\n[[Category:Milestone episodes]]\n\n[[de:Kampf um den Flügelorden]]\n[[es:EP133]]\n[[fr:EP131]]\n[[it:EP131]]\n[[ja:無印編第131話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第132集]]'}
