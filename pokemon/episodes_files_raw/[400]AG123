Grand Festival (3)!!\'\') is the 123rd episode of the {{series|Advanced Generation}}, and the 397th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on April 7, 2005 and in the United States on February 25, 2006. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/08_30-rhapsody-in-drew/-->\n<i>May and Harley face off in the main competition of the Grand Festival! It\'s Harley\'s Banette and Cacturne against May\'s Beautifly and Bulbasaur. May\'s team gets in the first hits, but Harley makes a comeback and it takes some quick thinking for May to beat Harley and move onto the semifinals.\n\nElsewhere, Jessie wants to impersonate a coordinator and sneak into the competition. Team Rocket decides to kidnap Robert, but Ash interrupts them as they make their move. Snorunt is hit by Team Rocket\'s Pokémon and evolves into a Glalie! Jessie thinks it\'s adorable, James thinks it\'s creepy, but either way, Glalie easily sends them packing.\n\nBack on the stage, May defeats Anthony\'s Pinsir and Combusken, but her next opponent will be an even greater challenge: Drew! And Drew has brought a Flygon he trained especially for the competition. Flygon and Roselia are up against Combusken and Skitty. It\'s a close fight but Roselia hits May\'s Pokémon with Stun Spore, followed by a Steel Wing from Flygon, and takes the win.\n\nNow it\'s Drew and Robert in the finals. To May\'s surprise, Robert earns the victory and wins the Festival. But Drew isn\'t upset—that night, even though there\'s a party, he goes right back to training. Impressed by his example, May sets her sights on next year\'s Grand Festival!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Harley]] starts his {{pkmn|battle}} with {{an|May}} by having his {{p|Banette}} use {{m|Screech}}, while his {{TP|Harley|Cacturne}} uses {{m|Bullet Seed}}. Both hit their marks and lower May\'s points. May has {{TP|May|Bulbasaur}} attack with {{m|Vine Whip}}; Harley\'s Pokémon try to dodge it, but Bulbasaur grabs onto their legs. Beautifly then uses {{m|Silver Wind}} that lowers Harley\'s points. Bulbasaur releases its grip on Cacturne and Banette, which sends them both spinning. Beautifly whips up a Silver Wind, sending Cacturne and Banette into a spin and leaving them dizzy. Bulbasaur tries to use Vine Whip again, but Banette counters with {{m|Torment}} so that Bulbasaur can\'t use the same move twice in a row.\n\nCacturne fires {{m|Pin Missile}} at Bulbasaur, but Beautifly carries the attack high into the air. Banette then fires {{m|Will-O-Wisp}}, but Bulbasaur uses {{m|Petal Dance}}, which combines with Will-O-Wisp to create sparkling dust all over the field, costing Harley more points. Cacturne retaliates with another Pin Missile, but Bulbasaur and Beautifly are unharmed, and they retaliate with a Silver Wind and Razor Leaf combination. Harley\'s points drop to zero as a result, and May moves on to the next stage. As he storms off in defeat, Harley tells [[Drew]] that he\'s probably happy to see him lose to May. Drew responds that May was just better than him, and Harley declares that he will be happy once he sees both of them lose.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Jessie]] is still set on becoming [[Top Coordinator]] even without any [[Ribbon]]s. [[James]] suggests that {{ho|Robert}} is their best chance, and they watch as he steps outside before ambushing him with a rope cannon. {{Ash}} arrives and has {{AP|Pikachu}} use {{m|Thunderbolt}} to free Robert from the rope. {{TRT}} recites their {{motto}} before calling out {{TP|James|Cacnea}} and {{TP|Jessie|Dustox}} to attack. {{AP|Snorunt}} tries to use {{m|Ice Beam}}. but it fails while everyone laughs at it. Robert gives Snorunt some encouragement and advises it to focus its energy in its head to be able to aim Ice Beam properly. Cacnea uses Pin Missile and Dustox uses {{m|Psybeam}} towards Pikachu, but Snorunt jumps in front to take the hit and evolves into {{p|Glalie}}. Ash scans Glalie with the [[Pokédex]]. Robert suggests to Ash to test out Glalie\'s Ice Beam. Glalie follows suit, using Ice Beam to freeze Team Rocket and send them blasting off.\n\nIn the second stage and with thirty seconds remaining, [[May\'s Combusken]] and Bulbasaur faced off against {{OBP|Anthony|AG122}} with {{p|Swalot}} and {{p|Pinsir}}. Combusken tries to use {{m|Peck}} but Pinsir comes out of Swalot\'s stomach to pinch Combusken\'s beak shut. Time runs out, but May has the most points remaining and moves on to the third stage. Anthony respectfully congratulates May on the win and wishes her luck in the next stage. The third stage match ups are soon revealed, and May will face off against Drew.\n\nIn the third stage, May\'s Combusken and {{TP|May|Skitty}} are up against [[Drew\'s Roselia]] and {{p|Flygon}}. May is surprised to see a Flygon, and Drew remarks that this match is its debut appearance. Roselia begins with a sparkling Petal Dance while Flygon flies right through it to attack. Skitty counters with {{m|Assist}} which comes out as {{m|Fire Spin}} and burns the opponents\' combination. Combusken uses {{m|Sky Uppercut}}, but misses its target and falls back onto Skitty. Flygon uses {{m|Flamethrower}} and Roselia unleashes a {{m|Solar Beam}} towards their opponents while May has Combusken use Fire Spin to push the combined attacks away. Drew loses a lot of points because of that. Combusken uses Fire Spin again while Flygon counters with {{m|Sandstorm}} which blows the attack away. Skitty aims a {{m|Blizzard}}, though Roselia jumps on top of Flygon to fly away and dodge it. Putting her trust in its unpredictability, May orders an Assist attack from Skitty, which turns into a Vine Whip. She orders Combusken use the Vine Whip to jump high into the air. Roselia calls for a {{m|Magical Leaf}} which Skitty counters with {{m|Blizzard}}. Flygon uses Flamethrower, but it is exactly what May wanted to happen. May has Combusken follow the flames towards Flygon and lashes it with Sky Uppercut. With little time and even fewer points remaining, May can only hope for a knock out to win the round. She calls for Skitty to use {{m|Tackle}} and Combusken uses {{m|Quick Attack}}. Roselia replies with a {{m|Stun Spore}} that hits and {{status|Paralysis|paralyses}} the pair. Flygon finishes the match off with {{m|Steel Wing}}. The five minutes is up and Drew is declared the winner. May is upset by the loss, but puts on a brave face as she checks on her Pokémon. The crowd begins cheering for May and her wonderful performance, though the applause infuriates Harley who declares that there is no justice in the world.\n\nDrew faces Robert in the final stage, and he is losing by a lot of points. {{p|Milotic}} uses {{m|Twister}} while {{p|Claydol}} rushes through the Twister and attacks Masquerain and Roselia with {{m|Hyper Beam}}, before Milotic finished them off with {{m|Iron Tail}}. With the win, Robert becomes a Top Coordinator and wins the coveted [[Ribbon Cup]]. During the awards ceremony, May says to Drew that she\'s sorry he lost, but Drew tells her that there is always someone better.\n\nLater that night, an after-party takes place to celebrate the conclusion of the [[Hoenn Grand Festival]]. May sits down after eating a lot, looks behind her and wonders where the flashing lights are coming from. She locates the source, and it is Drew continuing to practice his Contest techniques. Drew remarks that Robert is also training, hence why he became the Top Coordinator. Drew explains that if May wants to become a Top Coordinator, she has to keep practicing and getting better. He admits that he looks forward to the next Grand Festival and also expects May to be there. He promptly walks off, leaving May speechless. Ash offers May a vanilla ice cream cone, but startles her in the process. May\'s mother, [[Caroline]], realizes the pair were momentarily alone and suggests there might be a romantic connection. May sharply reminds her that she and Drew are just friends. She admits that Drew did give her something to consider however, admitting that she is planning on not giving up until she becomes a Top Coordinator. Caroline is very proud of her daughter\'s new ambition, but reminds May that now she has to support Ash as he tries to become the next [[Hoenn League]] Champion.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:Robert Ribbon Cup.png|thumb|220px|Robert holding the Ribbon Cup]]\n* {{an|May}} defeats [[Harley]] and advances to the second round of the [[Contest Battle|Battle Stage]].\n* {{ho|Robert}} is revealed to own a {{p|Claydol}}.\n* {{Ash}}\'s {{p|Snorunt}} [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{AP|Glalie}} and masters {{m|Ice Beam}}.\n* May defeats {{OBP|Anthony|AG122}} and advances to the quarterfinals.\n* [[Drew]] is revealed to have obtained a {{p|Flygon}}.\n* Drew defeats May in the quarterfinals and advances to the semifinals.\n* Drew defeats his opponent in the semifinals and advances to the finals.\n* Robert defeats Drew in the finals, winning the [[Hoenn Grand Festival]].\n* Robert receives the [[Ribbon Cup]] and becomes a [[Top Coordinator]].\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Glalie}} ({{OP|Ash|Glalie}})\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]] (×3)\n* [[Norman]]\n* [[Drew]]\n* [[Harley]]\n* [[Caroline]]\n* [[Vivian Meridian]]\n* [[Raoul Contesta]]\n* [[Mr. Sukizo]]\n* {{OBP|Anthony|AG122}}\n* {{ho|Robert}}\n* {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:PTC AG123.png|thumb|200px|right|Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]\n[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]: {{p|Golem}}\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Chimecho}} ({{OP|James|Chimecho}})\n* {{p|Snorunt}} ({{OP|Ash|Snorunt}}; evolves)\n* {{p|Glalie}} ({{OP|Ash|Glalie}}; newly evolved; debut)\n* {{p|Combusken}} ({{OP|May|Combusken}})\n* {{p|Beautifly}} ({{OP|May|Beautifly}})\n* {{p|Skitty}} ({{OP|May|Skitty}})\n* {{p|Bulbasaur}} ({{OP|May|Bulbasaur}})\n* {{p|Munchlax}} ({{OP|May|Munchlax}})\n* {{p|Dustox}} ({{OP|Jessie|Dustox}})\n* {{p|Cacnea}} ({{OP|James|Cacnea}})\n* {{p|Roselia}} ({{OP|Drew|Roselia}})\n* {{p|Masquerain}} ([[Drew]]\'s)\n* {{p|Flygon}} ([[Drew]]\'s)\n* {{p|Milotic}} ({{ho|Robert}}\'s)\n* {{p|Claydol}} ({{ho|Robert}}\'s)\n* {{p|Cacturne}} ({{OP|Harley|Cacturne}})\n* {{p|Banette}} ([[Harley]]\'s)\n* {{p|Swalot}} ({{OBP|Anthony|AG122}}\'s)\n* {{p|Pinsir}} (Anthony\'s)\n\n==Trivia==\n* This episode concludes the three-part [[Hoenn Grand Festival]] arc.\n* This is the last episode in which [[Drew\'s Roselia]] keeps its Japanese voice in the English dub.\n* The English dub title is most likely a reference to {{wp|George Gershwin}}\'s famous composition \'\'{{wp|Rhapsody in Blue}}\'\'.\n* [[Advance Adventure]], [[Ready Go!]], and music from \'\'[[M01|Mewtwo Strikes Back]]\'\' are used as background music.\n\n===Errors===\n* During the {{pkmn|battle}} between {{an|May}} and [[Harley]], {{an|Brock}} says that "{{p|Bulbasaur}} cannot use {{m|Vine Whip}} for \'\'awhile\'\' now", after {{p|Banette}} uses {{m|Torment}}.
