It first aired in Japan on March 22, 2012 and in the United States on July 21, 2012.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/15_23-search-for-the-clubultimate/-->\n<i>The Clubsplosion Tournament’s first round is under way, and the next match is Burgundy versus Iris! The two of them trade powerful attacks, and Burgundy tries to rattle Iris with some serious taunting—but Iris keeps her cool, and her Excadrill finally takes down Burgundy’s Dewott.\n\nDuring a break in the action, Ash and Scraggy decide to do some special training with Stephan and his Sawk, since Scraggy’s new Focus Blast isn’t all that focused yet. With some tips from Stephan, Scraggy manages to improve its aim in preparation for the next battle.\n\nIn the next match, “Dragon Buster” Georgia finally gets to show her stuff against a Dragon type, and she and her Bisharp quickly take down their opponent’s Druddigon! Georgia moves on to the second round, and of course she’s hoping to be paired up against her rival Iris next.\n\nNext up, the arrogant Montgomery and his Throh (who picked a fight with Stephan’s Sawk earlier in the round) defeat Delbert and his Mienshao easily. Throh exhibits an amazing blend of speed and strength, and Don George comments that Montgomery seems to be the guy to beat—which makes Stephan want to battle him even more!\n\nFinally, it’s Bianca and Emboar battling Trip and Conkeldurr! Emboar is clearly powerful, but Conkeldurr is adept at using its concrete pillars as a shield, and Emboar’s attacks just can’t get through. It looks like Trip has the upper hand when Conkeldurr knocks Emboar over with its pillars and then prepares to use Stone Edge! Can Bianca find a way out of this?</i>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Freddy O\'Martian]] announces that the {{pkmn|battle}} between {{an|Iris}} against [[Burgundy]] is going to begin very soon. {{an|Cilan}} says he is looking forward to seeing how much stronger Burgundy has gotten. {{Ash}}, {{AP|Scraggy}}, {{AP|Pikachu}} and {{TP|Iris|Axew}} give Iris support. Burgundy starts off by commanding {{p|Dewott}} to use {{m|Ice Beam}}. Ash is quite amazed. {{TP|Iris|Excadrill}} dodges twice but then instead of dodging again it blocks it. Cilan says Dewott has gotten stronger and Iris may struggle. [[Georgia]] says that Iris must win so she can battle her. {{an|Bianca}} pokes Scraggy and says unlike {{TP|Stephan|Sawk}}, Scraggy has no muscles. She checks to see if Scraggy has muscles on its stomach, causing Scraggy to {{m|headbutt}} Bianca.\n\nContinuing the battle, Dewott uses a {{m|Water Pulse}} which Excadrill dodges by using {{m|Dig}}. Burgundy tells Dewott to use Water Pulse in the hole, sending Excadrill flying. Dewott uses {{m|Razor Shell}}, but Excadrill counters with its {{m|Focus Blast}}. Trip then scans the pictures he took and says there\'s no point in watching anymore since he knows the battle style of the two. [[Montgomery]] says it\'s extremely boring and he doesn\'t have to worry about either Iris or Burgundy winning against him. Iris commands Excadrill to use {{m|Drill Run}} but Dewott blocks it. However both of its [[Scalchop and seamitar|scalchop]]s fall off. Iris commands Excadrill to use {{m|Metal Claw}}, which Burgundy just lets it use Metal Claw over and over again. Iris tells Burgundy that {{t|Water}} types may be resistant to the {{t|Steel}} type, but since Metal Claw was used repeatedly, it did a great deal of damage. However, this was all part of Burgundy\'s plan. Burgundy orders Dewott to use {{m|Revenge}}, which does lots of damage. Burgundy tells Dewott to finish the battle with a Razor Shell, which is countered by a Drill Run attack. Burgundy orders another Ice Beam which is countered again by a Focus Blast attack. Excadrill then defeats Dewott with a Dig-Drill Run combination, advancing her to the second round.\n\nEveryone takes a break for lunch at the [[Pokémon Center]]. Burgundy says next time, she\'ll get revenge on Iris and Cilan. However, Georgia says she\'ll be the one to defeat Iris, not Burgundy. Ash says hello to Trip and asks if Bianca is his first opponent. Trip rudely replies by saying Ash should worry about his own Pokémon and says Scraggy may have learned Focus Blast, but it hasn\'t mastered it yet. Later, Ash, tries to perfect Scraggy\'s Focus Blast. However, Ash and Scraggy have trouble perfecting it. However, Stephan says he and Sawk will help Scraggy. He says it would be good training for the second round as well. However, Bianca comes and admires Stephan and his Sawk. Iris and Cilan come to tell Ash the [[Clubsplosion]] is about to resume. Sawk punches one of the punching bags which is swung back and forth. Stephan then heads to the Clubsplosion with Sawk. Montgomery then laughs at Sawk after they head out. {{p|Throh}} stops the moving punching bag and throws it, breaking the punching bag to bits.\n\nLater on, [[Betty]] orders her {{p|Simipour}} to use {{m|Low Sweep}} on [[Getty]]\'s {{p|Simisear}}, knocking it out. The next match begins with [[Gail]] against Georgia. Georgia sends out {{p|Bisharp}} and Gail sends out her {{p|Druddigon}}. Georgia says this is a chance to show her Dragon Buster skills. Druddigon begins with {{m|Dragon Claw}} followed up by a {{m|Dragon Tail}}. But, Bisharp blocks the first attack and dodges the second. Georgia orders a {{m|Metal Sound}} then finishes Druddigon with an {{m|Iron Head}}. Then, the battle between Montgomery and [[Delbert]] begins. Ash scans {{p|Mienshao}} on his Pokédex. Delbert orders Mienshao to use {{m|Pound}}, which Throh swiftly dodges. Delbert tells Mienshao to use {{m|High Jump Kick}} which Throh counters with {{m|Superpower}}, followed up by {{m|Seismic Toss}}. Throh finally finishes Mienshao with {{m|Circle Throw}}.\n\nThe final match of the first round begins, with Trip against Bianca. Trip sends out {{p|Conkeldurr}} against Bianca\'s newly evolved {{TP|Bianca|Emboar}}. Bianca orders an {{m|Arm Thrust}} attack, which is blocked by Conkeldurr\'s concrete pillars. Emboar uses {{m|Hammer Arm}} which is also blocked. Bianca tells Emboar to use {{m|Flamethrower}} which is once again blocked. Trip tells Conkeldurr to use {{m|Bulk Up}}. Then Conkeldurr uses {{m|Strength}} doing lots of damage. Then Trip orders {{m|Rock Tomb}}, successfully trapping Emboar. Bianca commands Emboar to use Arm Thrust to break out, but it\'s no use. Finally, Trip tells Conkeldurr to finish the battle with {{m|Stone Edge}}.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
