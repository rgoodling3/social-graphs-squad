It first aired in Japan on September 29, 2019<!-- and is scheduled to air in the United States on *day*-->.\n{{spoilers}}\n<!--\n==Blurb==\nOfficial Blurb from Pokémon.com goes here, with source link-->\n<!--Please do not alter the blurb to fix any errors, they are meant to be presented as they are on the official site.-->\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing {{an|Professor Kukui}}\'s revelation that he is Masked Royal, {{Ash}} is momentarily stunned, but is nevertheless excited that he will battle Kukui in the {{wp|exhibition game|exhibition match}} tomorrow. Kukui promises to have the battlefield set up for tomorrow and requests a [[Full Battle]], prompting Ash to add {{AP|Naganadel}} to his [[Party|team]] for a full set of six. Kukui urges Ash to give it his all, finishing off with his signature Masked Royal pose. Meanwhile, {{DL|Guardian deities (anime)|Tapu Koko}} continues to hover around [[Manalo Stadium]].\n\n[[Caster]] welcomes the gathered spectators to the long-anticipated exhibition clash between [[Alola]]\'s first Champion Ash versus Masked Royal, making his true identity of Professor Kukui now public knowledge. In the lead up, Ash has {{AP|Melmetal}} perfect its {{m|Double Iron Bash}} technique by spinning around. Melmetal launches both of its fists into a tree, emitting a lot of force. {{Rotom}} offers its analysis, reporting that Melmetal\'s speed and force have vastly improved. Ash turns his attention to {{AP|Torracat}} and hypes it up for a battle and yet another chance for it to showcase its strengths against [[Professor Kukui\'s Incineroar]]. Meanwhile, Kukui and Incineroar are meditating to sharpen their focuses. Burnet confronts her husband, admitting that she is annoyed that as a fan she should have realized that Kukui was Masked Royal. She wishes him all the best regardless, and calls for him to give everyone a great show.\n\nThe [[Manalo Stadium]] erupts with cheers as Ash and Kukui make their way onto the battlefield. [[Hala]] will preside over the match, stating that rules are that the battle will be a six-on-six match with substitutions permitted. Reminding that the battle will be over when all Pokémon on one side are defeated, Hala expects a great battle from both fighters. Ash and Kukui shake hands, then take their positions. Caster calls for everyone to turn their attentions to the overhead screens, adding that it will keep track of the battle’s progression.\n\n{{AP|Pikachu}} is raring to go, but Ash decides to call Torracat onto the field first, much to his disappointment. Kukui predicted the selection, so he sends out Torracat\'s rival, Incineroar. Torracat\'s bell starts ringing, to which Ash and Kukui see Torracat is fired up for the round. Hala orders the battle to begin, and Ash has Torracat rush forward with a {{m|Flame Charge}}. Incineroar bolsters its strength with {{m|Bulk Up}} and takes the brunt, sending Torracat backwards. Torracat sprints into action with another Flame Charge, and its increased momentum help-s it dodge a retaliatory {{m|Darkest Lariat}}. With Incineroar\'s back turned, Torracat leaps in for a {{m|Fire Fang}}, though gets knocked away by Incineroar. Torracat recovers and encircles Incineroar with an increasingly fast Flame Charge. However, a {{m|Throat Chop}} knocks Torracat away and finally breaks the ring of fire. Incineroar rushes to attacks it opponent again, but Torracat lashes it with a {{m|Fire Blast}}.\n\nKukui is fully aware of Ash\'s speed-increasing strategy, and declares that Incineroar has no blind spots because of its [[Battle Royal]] training. Kukui orders Incineroar to use {{m|Blast Burn}}. As the fireball approaches, Torracat\'s bell then starts to chime and it runs directly into the attack. Ash realizes Torracat\'s plan is to absorb the power from the Blast Burn, so he has Torracat carry out its plan. Surprisingly, Torracat manages to absorb the entire Blast Burn into its bell. Torracat bides its time to charge up the flame energy swirling through its body. Ash calls for Torracat to  launch its own impromptu attack, "TorraBlast", but the strategy backfires as smoke begins to billow from Torracat\'s bell. Torracat struggles with the searing pain and exhaustion so Ash calls it back to its {{i|Poké Ball}} to recover. \n\nAfter Kukui decides to keep Incineroar on the field, Ash sends out {{AP|Lycanroc}}. With Incineroar still recovering from using Blast Burn, Lycanroc lands a direct hit with {{m|Accelerock}}. Lycanroc instantly follows up with {{m|Stone Edge}}. However, Incineroar spins into action with Darkest Lariat, breaking the oncoming attack into shards. Kukui is startled as Ash orders Lycanroc to grab one of the Stone Edge shards with its jaws. Incineroar counters with a Throat Chop, but Lycanroc still emerges unscathed and has managed to injure Incineroar\'s arm with the pointed stone. At this, Kukui switches Incineroar out for his {{p|Braviary}}. Ash is confident Lycanroc can manage, so the Full Battle continues. Braviary unleashes a {{m|Rock Slide}} with Ash and Lycanroc bracing themselves for their counter maneuver. \n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
