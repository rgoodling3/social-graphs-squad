It first aired in Japan on July 3, 2014 and in the United States on September 6, 2014.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/17_33-the-bonds-of-mega-evolution/-->\n<i>Following her grandfather\'s orders, Korrina has arrived on Pomace Mountain for some special training with Mabel, whose partner Mawile can Mega Evolve, and our heroes are along for the adventure. After a quick battle, Mabel suggests that everyone make flower arrangements with their Pokémon partners, much to their surprise.\n\nThis continues for several days, and while Bonnie and Dedenne are having a great time, Korrina and Lucario are getting impatient. But they soon learn that spending so much time together, exploring the beauty of the mountain and working together to make their beautiful arrangements, is exactly what they needed!\n\nDuring a late-night heart-to-heart talk between Mabel and Korrina, the Team Rocket villains make their move, grabbing Pikachu and Mawile. But all that training pays off! Korrina\'s voice is finally able to reach Mega Lucario and calm its battle rage, and with the help of Mega Mawile, Team Rocket is sent blasting off again.\n\nNow that Korrina can control Lucario\'s Mega Evolution, Ash decides he needs more training before challenging her at the Shalour Gym!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{cleanup|width=50%}}\nFollowing [[Gurkinn]]’s instructions, {{Ash}}, {{Ashfr}} and [[Korrina]] arrive at a house on [[Pomace Mountain]]. The door is opened by Mawile, and soon [[Mabel]] arrives and introduces herself to the group. She asks Korrina and Lucario to show her their strength in a battle.\n\nThe battle starts with Korrina [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolving]] [[Korrina\'s Lucario|Lucario]], and Mabel Mega Evolving her {{p|Mawile}}. Korrina commands Lucario to use {{m|Power-Up Punch}}, but Mawile dodges. Lucario uses {{m|Bone Rush}} without Korrina\'s order, but Mawile dodges all its attacks. Mawile uses {{m|Iron Head}} on Lucario. Lucario then loses its control due to its aura. Despire Korrina\'s urging, Lucario uses Power-Up Punch without any order. Mawile counters with {{m|Fairy Wind}} and Lucario faints.\n\n{{TRT}} are spying on the group and want to get their hands on Pikachu, Mega Mawile and Mega Lucario. They decide to wait and catch them off-guard.\n\nDespite Korrina\'s urge to train, Mabel asks the group to partner with their Pokémon and make flower arrangements. Clemont reveals his Flower Arranger One, which arranges flowers in the most artistic way possible. However, it becomes overloaded and blows up. \n\nAfter some time, Mabel comes in and inspects the arrangements. She states that these arrangements reflect their personality. Mabel exclaims that Ash\'s and Pikachu\'s arrangement show their hearts are one. However, she states that Korrina and Lucario have made two separate arrangements, which shows that they have similar personalities and a deep understanding of each other. \n\nThe next day, Ash and his friends go out in search for flowers. However, Mabel tells Korrina and Lucario to go up and see the mountain views and that they might see something wonderful. \n\nDay after day, the group continue to make flower arrangements until Mabel can see that their hearts are one. One day, as Korrina and Lucario go out to gather flowers, Korrina spots some beautiful white flowers on top of a cliff. Lucario climbs the cliff face but then falters, almost falling. Realising that some areas of the cliff were less sturdy than others, Korrina guides Lucario to climb in certain areas to reach the flower.\n\nThat night, Korrina wonders why Mabel has not started any training and why her grandfather recommended them come to Mabel. Mabel comes to Korrina and tells them that Lucario should be able to controls its aura soon. She tells them the reason why Lucario uses moves on its own is because of how close and similar Korrina and Lucario are. However, while they may have one heart, they have two viewpoints, and asks them to bring their one heart and two viewpoints together. \n\nAt that moment, glass cracks from somewhere and Pikachu screams. As everyone comes out to search for what had happened, Team Rocket fly into view in their balloon with Mawile and Pikachu trapped. After their motto, James shoots a missile to trap Lucario, but Lucario dodges. Jessie sends out {{TP|Jessie| Pumpkaboo}}. Korrina Mega evolves Lucario and orders it to use Power-Up Punch. James sends out {{TP|James|Inkay}} and commands it to use {{m|Psybeam}} while Jessie orders Pumpkaboo to use {{m|Shadow Ball}}. These moves cause Mega Lucario to lose control again. However, as Lucario is about to launch an attack, Korrina blocks it, and Lucario bites onto Korrina\'s arm. Korrina asks Lucario to remember their one heart and two viewpoints. The flowers on Korrina’s arm rings, making Lucario remember Korrina and what they have done so far. After a while, Lucario comes back to its senses.\n\nAs Pumpkaboo uses {{m|Dark Pulse}}, Lucario blocks the attack. As Inkay uses Psybeam and Pumpkaboo uses Shadow Ball, Lucario follows Korrina\'s orders and counters with Bone Rush. The impact of the attack frees Mawile and Pikachu.\n\nMabel Mega evolves Mawile and commands it to use Fairy Wind. Ash commands Pikachu to use {{m|Thunderbolt}}. Lucario then uses {{m|Aura Sphere}}, a move it learnt as a result of being able to control its aura. This sends Team Rocket blasting off.\n \nThe next day, the group say goodbye to Mabel and leave Pomace Mountain. Ash decides to leave Korrina and train more before he challenges the [[Shalour Gym]].\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
