I Received Some Experience Points!!\'\') is the 126th episode of the {{series|XY}}, and the 925th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on July 7, 2016 and in the United States on October 1, 2016.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/19_33-valuable-experience-for-all/-->\n<i>At the Kalos League, Ash defeats Astrid and her Mega Absol to move into the semifinals, securing a spot alongside Alain. There’s just one spot left—and Tierno and Sawyer are battling for it.\n\nTierno and his Pokémon are looking great as they leap into their battle dance, but the analytical Sawyer has been watching them and knows what to expect. He also has a secret weapon of his own—and when his Sceptile Mega Evolves, it’s all over!\n\nSawyer and Ash are paired for the semifinals in a six-on-six Full Battle. Ash has just five Pokémon traveling with him...until Keanan arrives, bringing Goodra to complete the team!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Malva]] reports directly from the [[Lumiose Conference|League]], chronicling the events that have taken place in the conference so far. Moments of {{pkmn|battle}}s are then shown. {{AP|Greninja}} transforms into Ash-Greninja and {{Ash}} wins, [[Astrid]] wins with her Mega {{p|Absol}} against an {{p|Amoonguss}}, [[Sawyer]] wins with his {{p|Slaking}} against a {{p|Medicham}}, and [[Remo]] wins with his Mega {{p|Garchomp}} against a {{p|Hydreigon}}. It is also revealed that [[Alain]] and {{an|Tierno}} have advanced to the quarterfinals. Now it is time for the challengers to fight their way into the Top 4. Malva ends her report, and the scene shifts to an ongoing battle between Ash and Astrid.\n\nAsh and Astrid are in the middle of their battle. As Astrid commands her Mega Absol to use {{m|Psycho Cut}}, {{AP|Hawlucha}} dodges and Ash commands it to retaliate with {{m|Flying Press}}. Hawlucha scores a direct hit, knocking Mega Absol out and sending Ash to the semifinals. Meanwhile, Alain is revealed to have won his own quarterfinals match as well. In the hall after his fight, Ash meets Sawyer before his own battle. Sawyer congratulates Ash on advancing and promises to win so he can face Ash like he vowed before. Ash warns that Tierno is a strong Trainer, but Sawyer is confident and hints at a secret weapon, and as they part Ash wishes him luck.\n\nMeanwhile, {{TRT}} is being dragged along by Malva, who is constantly busy conducting interviews. As a result, the trio is completely unable to focus on their own plans to steal any Pokémon.\n[[File:XY126 Tierno VS Sawyer.png|thumb|left|250px|Sawyer facing Tierno]]\nBack at the arena, Remo is revealed to have become the third semifinalist, just as {{an|Shauna}} arrives. She is warmly welcomed by the group and updated on the current League happenings. On the field, Tierno and Sawyer emerge for their battle, and Sawyer chooses {{p|Aegislash}} to start, which Ash scans with his [[Pokédex]]. Tierno sends out {{p|Ludicolo}} and shows off some perfectly synchronized dance steps with it. The match is begun, and Ludicolo starts off with {{m|Rain Dance}}, creating swirling thunder clouds over the battlefield that start a heavy downpour. Sawyer orders a {{m|Swords Dance}}, sharply raising Aegislash\'s {{stat|Attack}}.\n\nTierno calls out for a {{m|Hydro Pump}}, which Aegislash is unable to dodge. Sawyer correctly deduces that the rain has powered up both Ludicolo\'s speed, thanks to its {{a|Swift Swim}} Ability, as well as its {{type|Water}} attacks. However, after taking another Hydro Pump, Aegislash counters the next with {{m|King\'s Shield}}, {{a|Stance Change|transforming}} into its Shield form.\n\nTierno orders another Hydro Pump, but this time Aegislash cuts through it with a powerful {{m|Sacred Sword}} that sends Ludicolo flying. While Ludicolo is reeling, Sawyer orders another Swords Dance. Ludicolo tries to execute {{m|Solar Beam}}, but Aegislash uses Sacred Sword again to tear through it, connecting with Ludicolo and knocking it out. As Tierno thanks Ludicolo for his hard work, he sends out {{p|Raichu}} next. Raichu\'s opening {{m|Charge Beam}} is blocked by Aegislash\'s King\'s Shield, but he manages to burrow into the earth with {{m|Dig}} to evade Aegislash\'s followup {{m|Slash}}. Raichu takes advantage of the opening while Aegislash has lost sight of him to complete the attack and knock Aegislash out.\n\nMeanwhile, Team Rocket is about at the end of their rope with Malva\'s demanding schedule. James suggests simply quitting and focusing on stealing Pokémon and Jessie wholeheartedly agrees, but before they have a chance to act on it, Malva appears to pull them into another interview, much to their dismay.\n\nSawyer has now sent out {{p|Slurpuff}} to face Raichu, and Slurpuff executes a successful {{m|Attract}} on Raichu. This leaves her wide open to an {{m|Energy Ball}} from Slurpuff, after which Tierno decides to recall the helpless Raichu and replace him with {{TP|Tierno|Blastoise}}. Sawyer tries to open again with Attract, but Blastoise shrugs it off. Blastoise then fires off a heavy-hitting {{m|Hydro Cannon}}, knocking Slurpuff out.\n\nDown to his final Pokémon, Sawyer sends out his {{TP|Sawyer|Sceptile}}. Tierno orders {{m|Ice Beam}}, which Sceptile intercepts with a {{m|Leaf Storm}}. Blastoise tries to execute another Hydro Cannon, but Sceptile dodges it and lands a {{m|Leaf Blade}} in return. On Tierno\'s order, Blastoise charges towards Sceptile with {{m|Skull Bash}}, but Sawyer commands Sceptile to intercept it with {{m|Frenzy Plant}}. Enormous whip-like vines emerge from the field and toss Blastoise into the sky. As he falls, Blastoise manages to summon the thunderclouds with Rain Dance again, but upon impacting the ground, it is knocked out.\n\nTierno summons his last Pokémon, a now battle-ready Raichu. Ash worries that Sceptile is still the more powerful Pokémon, but when Tierno orders a {{m|Thunder}}, Clemont realizes that Blastoise\'s parting Rain Dance will ensure that Raichu\'s {{type|Electric}} attacks don\'t miss. Before Raichu can release his Thunder, however, Sawyer reveals his secret weapon and uses his [[Key Stone]] to [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] Sceptile. Refusing to be daunted, Tierno orders Raichu to complete its attack, but to Tierno\'s great surprise, Mega Sceptile comes through it completely unscathed. Sawyer reveals that, as a result of Mega Evolving, Mega Sceptile\'s Ability is now {{a|Lightning Rod}}, rendering Thunder useless. Mega Sceptile charges towards Raichu with a {{m|Dragon Claw}}, and Raichu tries to counter with {{m|Focus Blast}}, but Mega Sceptile slashes through the attack and lands the blow on Raichu, knocking him unconscious and winning the battle for Sawyer, making him the fourth and final semifinalist.\n\nWith the semifinalists decided, the announcer reveals the semifinal match-ups, which will pit Alain against Remo and Ash against Sawyer. As the sun sets, Ash exits the arena with his friends, who remind him that the semifinal battle will require a full team of six Pokémon, when he currently only has five. At this reminder, Ash panics about the time and runs off to a street outside where he comments that he\'s expecting someone. The others are confused, but a honking truck soon draws their attention. Turning towards the sound, they spot {{AP|Goodra}}, previously left at its home swamp, riding in the bed of a truck being driven by [[Keanan]]. In a flashback, it is revealed that during his latest visit to the wetlands, Ash had requested Goodra\'s assistance for the league\'s semifinals, and it agreed. With his team now complete, Ash summons them all before him to declare his confidence in them and vow to beat Sawyer with their help, and the whole team cheers in agreement.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

Since Tierno had made it to the quarterfinals and thus had defeated this Trainer, it should have been impossible for Astrid to face her in the league.\n* When Astrid tells her {{p|Absol}} to use {{m|Psycho Cut}}, it is shown as a regular Absol, but seconds later, when {{AP|Hawlucha}} attacks it, it is shown as a [[Mega Evolution|Mega]] Absol. This is likely due to the fact that the animation in the shot where Astrid tells her Absol to attack was taken directly from \'\'[[XYS01|Mega Evolution Special I]]\'\', where Absol was in its regular form while using the move.\n* When Tierno sends out {{p|Raichu}}, its nose is smaller than normal.\n* When {{p|Slurpuff}}\'s {{m|Attract}} fails to work on {{TP|Tierno|Blastoise}}, {{an|Clemont}} suggests that it is because both Blastoise and Slurpuff are male. However, Tierno\'s {{p|Raichu}}, who had just been affected by Attract, has a pointed tail that male Raichu have.\n** Also, in this scene in the dub, after Clemont finishes talking about Blastoise eliminating Slurpuff\'s Attract, Clemont\'s mouth is still moving, but no sound comes out.\n* When {{TP|Sawyer|Sceptile}} uses Leaf Storm to counter {{m|Ice Beam}}, Sceptile\'s Sceptilite, as well as the ends of the scarf, change position from near Sceptile\'s left shoulder to its right. Every other time they are seen, they are shown near Sceptile\'s left shoulder.\n* Shortly after Tierno sends out Raichu for the second time, the back of Raichu\'s right ear is completely yellow instead of brown.\n* When Ash takes out his [[Pokédex]], it is shown to already be open, but when it is pointed at Sawyer\'s {{p|Aegislash}}, it is shown to open up again.\n* Shortly after Sceptile Mega Evolves, the scoreboard shows Blastoise instead of Raichu. However, when it shows Raichu after the battle ends, a different image of Raichu is shown.\n* Near the end in the dub, when Ash is talking to his Pokémon, his words do not match up with his mouth.\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=A1D175|bordercolor=6FB82B\n|cs={{tt|Cenná zkušenost pro všechny!|A valuable experience for all!}}\n|da={{tt|En vigtig erfaring for alle!|An important experience for all!}}\n|nl={{tt|Een waardevolle ervaring voor iedereen!|A valuable experience for everyone!}}\n|fi={{tt|Arvokkaita kokemuksia!|Valuable experiences!}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Une précieuse expérience pour tous !|A valuable experience for all!}}\n|de={{tt|Wertvolle Erfahrungen für alle!|Valuable experiences for all!}}\n|it={{tt|Un\'esperienza preziosa per tutti!|A precious experience for all!}}\n|ko={{tt|메가나무킹 대 라이츄! 한수 배우겠습니다!!|Mega Sceptile VS Raichu!
