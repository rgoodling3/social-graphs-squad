In another part of the forest, Top Ranger Kellyn recruits some Blastoise to quench the flames, but Ash must rely on Chimchar\'s Dig to keep him safe. As soon as the coast is clear, Ash sneaks onboard Hunter J\'s ship and confronts her in person, only to discover that she already knew he was there. Hunter J then ejects Ash from the ship in mid-air, but a timely rescue by Kellyn and Staraptor keeps the show from coming to a premature end.\n\nAs Ash and his friends consider their next move, Ash realizes he can use his Aura connection with Riolu to sense its location. Everyone saddles up on some Dodrio and sets off in pursuit, hoping to intercept Hunter J before she can hand off Riolu to her client. They reach Hunter J\'s rendezvous point, but they\'re too late: the client has already gotten Riolu, and he leaps on a Fearow and takes off with his prize! While Dawn, Brock, Officer Jenny, and Solana hold off the client\'s troops, Kellyn and Ash spur on their Dodrio in pursuit.\n\nKellyn\'s Dodrio leaps onto Fearow to bring it down, yet it still doesn\'t convince the client to give up Riolu. He flees into a cave and blocks the path behind him, not realizing that Kellyn can recruit a Donphan to clear the way and Ash can use Aura to find Riolu. The client is finally cornered and knocked out by Pikachu\'s Volt Tackle, his men are subdued and put in custody. As for Pokémon Hunter J, she escapes to hunt another day, but Riolu is safely headed home to the Paradise Kingdom. So for now, Ash and his friends are happy with a job well done as they continue down the road to Pastoria City!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{incomplete plot}}\n[[J|Hunter J]] continues to burn down the forest, and succeeds in capturing {{p|Riolu}} in the process. {{an|Dawn}} and {{an|Brock}} help all the Pokémon escape the forest, and [[Kellyn]] enlists three Blastoise to use {{m|Rain Dance}} to put out the fire. Meanwhile, in the forest, {{Ash}} escapes with the help of Buizel\'s {{m|Water Gun}} and Chimchar\'s {{m|Dig}}. Ash sneaks aboard J\'s ship, but J knew about Ash sneaking on board and ejects him herself by first having Drapion grab him,then when Pikachu and Ash kicked Drapion, and landed, the ground parted, causing Ash to fall out of the ship. Freefalling, Kellyn uses a {{p|Staraptor}} to catch Ash in midair. Kellyn learns from Solana that J\'s client also escaped.\n\nWith J\'s ship hidden and with no other leads it is left to Ash\'s unique sense of [[Aura]] and Kellyn\'s abilities as a {{OBP|Pokémon Ranger|Ranger series}} to help them find it. Ash and friends ride {{p|Dodrio}} to get to the rendezvous point, where the client picks up Riolu. After delivering Riolu, J and her troupes leave the client to battle Ash and company on his own. Ash uses Staravia to cut the tires on the van so the client can\'t escape; instead, he summons his {{p|Fearow}} and flies away on its back. Solana and Officer Jenny arrive, offering to take care of J\'s client; Brock and Dawn stay with them. The client runs into a cave and blocks the entrance with {{p|Aggron}}. He then finds the cave littered with tunnels. Outside, Kellyn and Ash follow the client inside the cave, yet the find the main entrance blocked by Aggron\'s Rock Smash attack. Ranger Kellyn sees a Donphan and captures it. Using Donphan\'s Rollout, they knock down the barrier, only to find the tunnels all covered up with rocks. Ash uses Riolu\'s Aura connection to find which tunnel the client went through, then uses Donphan\'s Rollout to knock down the tunnel on the farthest left leading to the client and Riolu.\n\nThe client, surprised that Ash and Kellyn found him and asks how they found him. Ash briefly states that Riolu told him. The client then send out Aggron to battle. Using Pikachu\'s {{m|Volt Tackle}}, Ash is able to knock Aggron out and knock Riolu out of the client\'s arms. Ash then picks Riolu up and lets it out of the case.\nLater, Officer Jenny arrested J\'s client. Riolu\'s owner finally reunites with Riolu and thanks Ash, Solana, Dawn, and Brock for returning Riolu. Ash then remembers that he still has the little doll Riolu owns. He gives it back to Riolu and steps back only to get caught in its Aura communication, as Riolu thanks him for returning the doll to it.\n\n==Major events==\n* [[J]] steals the [[Aura Sphere Riolu|special]] {{p|Riolu}}.\n* {{Ash}} saves Riolu from J and {{OBP|J\'s client|DP071|the man}} J is working for.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Kellyn]]\n* [[Solana]]\n* [[Officer Jenny]]\n* [[J]]\n* [[J\'s henchmen]]\n* {{OBP|J\'s client|DP071}}\n* J\'s client\'s henchmen\n* Riolu\'s Trainer\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:Riolu DVD.png|thumb|right|Japanese DVD art]]\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Piplup}} ({{OP|Dawn|Piplup}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Staravia}} ({{OP|Ash|Staravia}})\n* {{p|Chimchar}} ({{OP|Ash|Chimchar}})\n* {{p|Buizel}} ({{OP|Ash|Buizel}})\n* {{p|Buneary}} ({{OP|Dawn|Buneary}})\n* {{p|Pachirisu}} ({{OP|Dawn|Pachirisu}})\n* {{p|Ambipom}} ({{OP|Dawn|Ambipom}})\n* {{p|Croagunk}} ({{OP|Brock|Croagunk}})\n* {{p|Salamence}} ({{OP|J|Salamence}})\n* {{p|Drapion}} ([[J]]\'s)\n* {{p|Growlithe}} ({{OP|Officer Jenny|Growlithe}})\n* {{p|Fearow}} (client\'s)\n* {{p|Aggron}} (client\'s)\n* {{p|Golem}} (client\'s henchmen\'s)\n* {{p|Rhyhorn}} (client\'s henchmen\'s)\n* {{p|Tyranitar}} (client\'s henchmen\'s)\n* {{p|Graveler}} (client\'s henchmen\'s)\n* {{p|Nidoking}} (client\'s henchmen\'s)\n* {{p|Riolu}} ([[Aura Sphere Riolu]])\n* {{p|Dodrio}} (×4)\n* {{p|Blastoise}} (×3)\n* {{p|Rattata}} (×6)\n* {{p|Pidgey}} (×2)\n* {{p|Swablu}} (×2)\n* {{p|Doduo}} (×2)\n* {{p|Budew}} (×5)\n* {{p|Spearow}} (×2)\n* {{p|Oddish}} (×14)\n* {{p|Butterfree}} (×2)\n* {{p|Vibrava}}\n* {{p|Yanma}}\n* {{p|Mankey}}\n* {{p|Bellsprout}} (×4)\n* {{p|Skiploom}}\n* {{p|Nidorino}}\n* {{p|Nidoran♀}} (×4)\n* {{p|Nidoran♂}} (×2)\n* {{p|Gloom}}\n* {{p|Sandshrew}} (×2)\n* {{p|Sunkern}} (×6)\n* {{p|Staraptor}}\n* {{p|Donphan}}\n* {{p|Trapinch}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[Professor Oak\'s Big Pokémon Encyclopedia]]: [[Capture Styler]]\n* Due to {{Ash}}\'s sensitivity to [[Aura]], which was first introduced in \'\'[[M08|Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]\'\', he is able to sense [[Aura Sphere Riolu|Riolu]] from far distances, making the {{pkmn|movie}} at least partially [[canon]].\n* [[Solana]] has a different uniform than the one she had in her past appearances.
