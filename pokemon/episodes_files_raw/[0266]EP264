It was first broadcast in Japan on September 5, 2002 and in the United States on September 15, 2003.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/06_02-mother-of-all-battles/-->\n<i>Now that they have finally gaining Larvitar\'s trust, the group head towards the Pokémon Reserve on Mt. Silver, as led by Larvitar. While crossing the bridge onto the reserve, the group does not realize they are being watched by three poachers, Braggo, Blurt, and Chico, who are inside a submerged submarine!\n\nAsh, Misty and Brock come across a roar in the distance, which belongs to a Tyranitar. Brock notices its scar, which matches the scar from Larvitar\'s dream, proving that this is indeed its mother. When Ash nudges Larvitar over to meet its mother, Tyranitar misinterprets the gesture and fires a Hyper Beam right at them! It believes Ash, Brock, and Misty are the original poachers, and chases after them in a fit of rage; the problem is enhanced by Larvitar, as it refuses to leave Ash behind!  Larvitar\'s Screech snaps Tyranitar out of it, as it realizes that Larvitar is its baby, and that Ash, Brock, and Misty pose no threat. The threat arrives soon after, as the poachers return, trying to capture Tyranitar by trapping it in a Pokébag! Ash recognizes the poachers from Larvitar\'s dream, and immediately tries to get Tyranitar back.\n\nWhen the poachers hear Ranger Mason approaching, they trap Ash in one of their bags and head off. Brock calls out Crobat to follow them, while charming up Ranger Mason. Mason informs them that they took the wrong road, as had they have not crossed the bridge, they would have made it right to the Preservation Center. As they work on finding the poachers, Team Rocket beat them to it and ask Braggo if they can join them. Braggo accepts, giving Jessie and James the packing machine in order to draw attention elsewhere, leaving an opportunity to escape with Tyranitar.\n\nCrobat reports back to Brock, giving Ash and crew an idea of where the poachers are hiding, but come across Team Rocket instead. Pikachu and Croconaw work together to redirect their attack, blasting Team Rocket off, while the poachers activate their poaching machine by remote to grab Croconaw and Pikachu! Larvitar uses its Screech to awaken Tyranitar, who uses its Hyper Beam to break their remote control. The bags break, freeing Tyranitar and the others, while a combined attack from Tyranitar and Larvitar destroy the machine, and free Pikachu and Croconaw.\n\nRanger Mason thanks Ash and friends for the help catching the poachers, but Ash puts the thanks all on Larvitar\'s head. Finally reunited with its mother, Larvitar remains at the Reserve, while Ash, Misty, and Brock head towards Silver Town!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} continue their trek towards the [[Mt. Silver]] Pokémon Preserve to return {{AP|Larvitar}} to its home. The group stops briefly as {{an|Brock}} tries to gather his bearings. Meanwhile, {{an|Misty}} marvels at Larvitar’s improved confidence as the young Pokemon is happily being carried in Brock\'s arms. Brock is unable to read his guidebook\'s map for directions to the Preserve, though Larvitar leaps out of his arms and rushes over a nearby rope bridge. The group follows, deciding that it\'s leading them to it birthplace. While everyone is crossing, a periscope rises from the water, watching them. On the other side, Larvitar is cheerier than usual as its guides everyone though a forested area. In the bushes, a machine is hidden with the same periscope aimed at them. Inside are [[Pokémon Poacher Brothers|three men]], who decide to steal Larvitar after spotting it walked passed.\n\nThe group stops walking after hearing some loud noises. The growls continue to get closer and the ground begins to shake, until a huge Pokémon appears in front of them. Ash holds up his [[Pokédex]] and learns that they have encountered a {{p|Tyranitar}}. The group notices a familiar scar on Tyranitar\'s chest, and realize that this must be the very Tyranitar they saw in [[EP263|Larvitar\'s dream]]. Brock declares that the Tyranitar must be Larvitar\'s mother. Tyranitar looks endearingly at its child. Unfortunately, she gets upset when Ash tries to push Larvitar forward and fires a {{m|Hyper Beam}} at the group. Brock realizes that she probably thinks they are the poachers. They run away, leaving Larvitar with its mother. Ash looks back and sees Larvitar crying and running behind them, despite Ash telling it to stay. Larvitar ignores the group’s pleas and grabs a hold of {{AP|Pikachu}}’s tail. Tyranitar fires off another Hyper Beam as Ash and his friends continue to flee. Ash eventually drops Larvitar and Tyranitar looks at it curiously. Larvitar lets out a mighty {{m|Screech}}. Tyranitar suddenly realizes that Larvitar is her child and apologizes to Ash and his friends. \n\nJust then, the periscope locks on to Tyranitar. Following Braggo\'s orders, Chico fires a giant Pokébag, which wraps around Tyranitar and causes her to hit the ground. A bag wraps itself around her and she falls down. The machine rides out and the three men emerge to marvel at their grand catch. The group instantly recognizes them as the poachers from Larvitar\'s dream. They introduce themselves as Braggo, the leader who always speaks in rhyme and quotes, Chico, the inventor for the group, and Blurt, who calls himself the strong and silent type who always breaks things and talks a lot. They declare that they are the Pokémon Poacher Brothers. Meanwhile, {{TRT}} flies over the area in their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|Meowth balloon]] and watches everything through their binoculars. [[Jessie]] remarks that the poacher brothers\' routine was unoriginal. [[James]] is discouraged by the fact that the poachers have good equipment, and can make rhymes. Jessie makes a terrible rhyme furthering James’s point. Jessie states that if they can’t beat them, then they will join them, steal their equipment and Pokémon, and leave. {{MTR}} and James agree.\n\nBraggo is pleasantly surprised to learn that Larvitar is the very one they stole when it was just an Egg, and the poacher trio thank Ash for returning it to them. The poachers launch another Pokébag at Larvitar, but Ash jumps in the way and is caught instead. After hearing sirens, the poachers decide that Tyranitar is good enough and drive away. Brock sends out {{TP|Brock|Crobat}} to follow them. A few seconds later, a lady rides up on a motorcycle and asks if everything’s okay. Brock rushes up and says that everything is okay now. She says that she’s [[Ranger Mason]] and that the poachers have been bothering them for quite some time. She has her {{DL|Ranger Mason|Pokémon|Croconaw}} get Ash out of the capture bag. Ranger Mason informs the group that they would have reached the Preserve if they had simply stayed on the road. Ash notices that Larvitar is feeling down and he promise that they will get its mother back. Ranger Mason crouches down to assure Larvitar, but this startles it. Misty and Brock inform her that Larvitar takes a while to warm up to people.\n\nMeanwhile, Team Rocket are begging to be accepted into the poachers\' gang. Braggo and his brothers feel cricks in their necks and suggest the Rocket trio gives them a massage each. Team Rocket\'s incredible obedience helps them get accepted into the poaching troupe. However, Crobat peeks over the side of the robot and flies back to inform Brock. Braggo lets Team Rocket use the robot to capture Larvitar and {{AP|Pikachu}}. Jessie and her teammates are overexcited about their upgrade, but they are unaware that Braggo is using them as cover while he and his brother\'s make their escape. Tyranitar struggles in her capture bag. Chico laughs, saying that the more she struggles, the tighter the bag will become.\n\nCrobat finds Brock and reports back, and soon after the poachers’ robot zooms down a hill towards them. Team Rocket pops out and recites their {{motto}}. However, Mason and the others are confused. Jessie explains that she and her teammates are now aligned with Braggo, and then fires a Pokébag. Pikachu uses {{m|Thunderbolt}} and Croconaw uses {{m|Hydro Pump}} that sends the bag back at Team Rocket and sends them blasting off. The real poachers, however, are getting away in Team Rocket\'s balloon. Chico uses a remote control to control the mecha. It grabs Pikachu and Croconaw, and then shoots a bag at the group for good measure. Ash tells Larvitar to use Screech, and the ear-splitting sound distracts the poachers and makes Tyranitar angry. She fires a few Hyper Beams at the bag. Chico presses a button on a remote to electrocute Tyranitar, but despite the pain, she bites through and fires a Hyper Beam at the balloon. As the poachers plummet towards the earth, Chico drops the remote which breaks into pieces after it lands on the ground, freeing the humans from the bag. As Larvitar is reunited with Tyranitar, they see the banged up poachers jump into their robot. As the robot is about to crush everyone, Tyranitar and Larvitar launch a Hyper Beam and {{m|Hidden Power}} respectively. Ash catches Pikachu while Croconaw lands on Brock. Afterwards, Larvitar and Tyranitar hug.\n\nRanger Mason thanks the group for helping her catch the poacher brothers, who are now tied up together. Ash tells her that Larvitar is the real hero, and she crouches down to thank it. This time Larvitar doesn\'t seem afraid and smiles back in appreciation. Mason declares that Larvitar has gained more confidence. Brock adds that he has also developed more confidence and grabs a hold of Mason\'s hands, but Misty drags him away by the ear for his troubles. Later Ranger Mason instructs the group to follow the river road, which will get them directly to {{jo|Silver Town}}. As they farewell Mason, Larvitar and its mother appear to say their goodbyes to the group as well. Meanwhile, Team Rocket remains bundled up together in a bag and can only struggle as they hang precariously from a rope bridge.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrive at [[Mt. Silver]].\n* Ash leaves {{AP|Larvitar}} with {{p|Tyranitar|its mother}} at [[Ranger Mason]]\'s preserve.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n=====TV episode debuts=====\n* {{p|Croconaw}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n[[File:PMTV EP264.png|thumb|200px|{{tt|Pocket Monster TV|Who\'s That Pokémon}}]]\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Ranger Mason]]\n* [[Pokémon Poacher Brothers]]\n* {{tc|Pokémon Ranger|Rangers}}\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP EP264.png|thumb|200px|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Shuckle}} \'\'(US and international)\'\', {{p|Tyranitar}} \'\'(Japan)\'\'\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Togepi}} ({{OP|Misty|Togepi}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Crobat}} ({{OP|Brock|Crobat}})\n* {{p|Croconaw}} ([[Ranger Mason]]\'s)\n* {{p|Larvitar}} ([[Ash\'s Larvitar|anime]])\n* {{p|Tyranitar}}\n{{right clear}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* The dub title of this episode is a reference to {{wp|Saddam Hussein}}\'s famous quote about the {{wp|Gulf War}}, regarding it as the "mother of all battles".\n* This episode is featured on the \'\'Volume 10: Rock\'\' copy of [[Pokémon Elements]].\n* [[James]] expresses jealousy that [[Pokémon Poacher Brothers|Braggo]] is able to speak in rhyme, and [[Jessie]] tries unconvincingly to demonstrate her ability to rhyme. This is ironic, because {{TRT}}\'s rhymes and puns are a running gag.\n\n===Errors===\n* In the {{pmin|Spain|Spanish}} dub, Braggo is heard saying "Time to cash in your chips" in English.\n** Also, in the {{pmin|Finland|Finnish}} dub, both the Finnish and English voices of Braggo are heard simultaneously during this line. The same error appears in the {{pmin|Poland|Polish}} dub.\n** Also, in the Polish dub, the Polish and English voices of Braggo are heard simultaneously during the line "Run today to fight another day."\n* In the {{pmin|Sweden|Swedish}} dub, when the Pokémon Poaching Brothers are leaving with Tyranitar before Brock calls out Crobat, the sound of Brock throwing the Poké Ball and it opening can be heard instead of the machine leaving.\n** In the {{pmin|Norway|Norwegian}} dub, there is no background sound.\n* After Crobat reports back to Brock and his friends, it disappears for the rest of the episode, as Brock is never seen recalling it back in its Poké Ball. However, he could have done it off screen.\n* In one scene, Pikachu\'s voice can be heard, but his mouth does not move.\n* In another scene the opposite is true for Croconaw, as its mouth moves, but his voice can\'t be heard.\n* Brock once refers to Larvitar\'s mother as a male.\n* When the remote broke to pieces, Ash and company were able to break free from the bag. But Team Rocket Trio, who had also been captured in the bag, was not freed, as is evident from the end of the episode.\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|zh_cmn={{tt|班吉拉與由基拉|Tyranitar and Larvitar}}\n|da={{tt|En Mor Med Slag I|A Gutsy Mother}}\n|de={{tt|Glücklich vereint|Happily united}}\n|nl={{tt|De Moeder der Gevechten|The mother of all battles}}\n|fi={{tt|Kaikkien taisteluiden äiti|The mother of all battles}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Qui vole un oeuf...|Who steals an egg...}} {{tt|*|The French title was again used in AG150 - May\'s Egg-Cellent Adventure}}\n|he=אם כל הקרבות{{tt|em kol hakravot|Mother of all battles}}\n|it={{tt|Ritorno a casa|Return at home}}\n|no={{tt|Tidenes kamp|The all-time battle}}\n|pt_br={{tt|A Mãe de Todas as Batalhas|The Mother of the All Battles}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|A Mãe de Todas as Batalhas|The Mother of All Battles}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡La madre de todas las batallas!|The mother of all battles!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|La madre de todas las batallas|The mother of all battles}}\n|sv={{tt|Återföreningen|The reunion}}\n|pl={{tt|Pomogę ci, mamo|I\'ll help you, mom}}\n|hi=Larvitar की मॉम को बचाओ! {{tt|\'\'Larvitar ki mom ko bachao!\'\'|Save/Protect Lavitar\'s Mom!}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n}}\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP263 |\nprevtitle=Address Unown! |\nnextcode=EP265 |\nnexttitle=Pop Goes The Sneasel |\nseries=Original series |\nepisodelist=List of original series episodes |\ncolorscheme=Johto }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0264}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|264]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Hideki Sonoda]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded and directed by Hiroaki Shimura]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Hiroaki Shimura]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Hiroaki Shimura]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Kumiko Shishido]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a main character releases or gives away a Pokémon]]\n\n[[de:Glücklich vereint]]\n[[es:EP266]]\n[[fr:EP264]]\n[[ja:無印編第264話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第265集]]'}
