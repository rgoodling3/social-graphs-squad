It was first broadcast in Japan on February 14, 2002 and in the United States on February 22, 2003. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/05_27-the-rage-of-innocence/-->\n<i>Before they can oppose Team Rocket\'s evil plan to gain control of the Pokémon of the world, Ash and friends must escape from a Team Rocket holding pen. With their Pokémon rendered unable to fight by a sinister Team Rocket technology, this would be an impossible task—impossible that is if Jessie and James had not been fortuitously chosen to watch over them. When, sure enough, Jessie and James slip up, Ash and friends jump on the opportunity to escape. Together with Lance and his Dragonite, they must not only stop Team Rocket from perfecting their Pokémon Evolution Inducement machine, but also somehow quell the rage of the red Gyarados, as it threatens to destroy a nearby town.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter capturing the [[Red Gyarados]], {{OBP|Tyson|Team Rocket}} and his cohorts travel back to [[Mahogany Town]] to continue their studies on the Red Gyarados, so they can perfect their [[Evolution]] Inducement Ray. [[Lance]], disguised as a {{tc|Team Rocket Grunt}}, stops following the others and makes a call to [[Officer Jenny]] in Mahogany Town to inform her of Team Rocket\'s hideout. After the call ends, Lance heads back to the [[Lake of Rage]].\n\nAfter being captured by Tyson, {{Ash}} yells to be let out of the cell, and [[Jessie]] and [[James]] say that they\'re in charge of guarding the door. Finally, {{AP|Pikachu}} and {{TP|Misty|Togepi}} wake up, but when Ash asks if Pikachu could break down the cell with a {{m|Thunder Shock}}, Ash finds that he\'s still too weak to do any damage. With Pikachu now awake, Jessie and James say that they are now going to take him to the {{an|Giovanni|boss}}. Ash, {{an|Misty}}, and {{an|Brock}} hold their ground, but Jessie sends out {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}} with a {{m|Poison Sting}} to break them up. Jessie tries to unlock Pikachu\'s restraint, but the remote accidentally unlocks all of their restraints, allowing Ash to send out {{AP|Cyndaquil}} with a {{m|Smokescreen}}. After the smoke clears, Jessie, James, Arbok, and {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} find that they have been put into the restraints. They struggle free, and {{MTR}} recovers in time to join in the pursuit of the [[twerps]]. Arbok uses a Poison Sting to stop the group. Jessie then orders Arbok to {{m|Wrap}} them, but Arbok is blown away by [[Lance\'s Dragonite]]\'s {{m|Thunder Wave}}. Arbok tries to use {{m|Acid}}, but Dragonite\'s {{m|Twister}} sends the Team Rocket trio blasting off.\n\nLance is glad to see Ash and his friends again. While they defied his orders, Lance admits that he shares their concerns for the Red Gyarados. He tells the group that the Evolution Inducement Ray has to be destroyed, and Dragonite\'s {{m|Hyper Beam}} does the trick. Immediately afterward, Lance and the others get in the car and drive towards Mahogany Town.\n\nTeam Rocket have arrived at their meeting point, and two helicopters soon take off. [[Professor Sebastian]] leaves in the second escort flight, leaving Tyson in charge. Tyson suddenly receives a call from Jessie and James telling him that the machine had been destroyed. Jessie and James order a 50-man backup, but Tyson hangs up on them. While transporting the Gyarados via helicopter, the effects of the Evolution Inducement Ray wears off on the Gyarados, causing it to thrash around. Tyson orders his pilot to control the helicopter. However the Red Gyarados\'s struggle eventually causes the two Rocket helicopters to crash into the river below. Gyarados emerges free of its net and goes into a rampage. The Gyarados swims away, and while driving beside the water, Ash spots it. Ash gets out to possibly calm the Gyarados, but Gyarados shoots a {{m|Hydro Pump}} at him. Lance stops the vehicle, and he rushes over to Ash’s side to confront the Gyarados himself. Tyson soon pulls up. He orders his men ahead while he challenges Lance to a {{pkmn|battle}}. Ash, Misty, and Brock run after the Gyarados, leaving Lance to confront Tyson. Lance\'s Dragonite soon defeats Tyson\'s two {{p|Fearow}} with a Twister attack. The police arrive on the scene and Officer Jenny places Tyson under arrest for violating conservation laws.\n\nMeanwhile, Team Rocket again captures Gyarados with a net and shocks it into submission. They pull it out of the river, but Ash has {{AP|Bayleef}} use {{m|Razor Leaf}} to cut the net. A grunt tries to catch the kids with a net, but Gyarados\'s Hyper Beam blows the grunts away. Gyarados soon collapses from its injuries. Ash urges Gyarados to go back to the river, but Jessie and James show up in the [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|Meowth balloon]] and catch Gyarados with another net. Ash jumps and grabs onto the net to save the Gyarados, but Meowth tries to shake him off unsuccessfully. Gyarados thrashes again and breaks the net free from the balloon. Gyarados continues down the river, but Team Rocket say they will catch Pikachu anyway. However, Pikachu easily defeats Arbok and sends Team Rocket blasting off with a {{m|Thunderbolt}}.\n\nThe group rushes onto a bridge as Gyarados continues its rampage towards Mahogany Town. Ash tries to talk the Gyarados into becoming calm, but Gyarados tries to attack them with Hyper Beam. [[Pryce|An old man]] appears and orders his {{TP|Pryce|Dewgong}} to use {{m|Ice Beam}} on the river, which stops Gyarados from traveling any further. He tells them that Pokémon and humans are not meant to be friends, and it\'s putting them in danger. Ash and his friends soon leave as the Gyarados turns away to continue its outrage in the opposite direction.\n\nDown the river, Lance\'s Dragonite is trying to fight the Red Gyarados. The two Pokémon exchange a barrage of attacks. Ash and his friends urge Lance to stop the battle, but Lance insists that battling is the only way to calm Gyarados\'s anger. Dragonite manages to {{status|paralyze}} Gyarados with a Thunder Wave. A follow up Twister causes Gyarados to hit the water. The Red Gyarados rises again, and as it prepares to fire a Hyper Beam, Dragonite’s own Hyper Beam hits first. Gyarados soon faints, and Lance captures it with a {{i|Poké Ball}}.\n\nBy sunset, Officer Jenny salutes Lance for his efforts. She soon leaves to continue her investigation into Team Rocket\'s activities. Lance thanks the group, and assures Ash that he will look after the Red Gyarados and treat it as a friend. Ash is instantly cheered up. Afterwards, Lance flies off on his Dragonite, and says goodbye to Ash and his friends.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} meet [[Pryce]].\n* [[Lance]] {{pkmn2|caught|catches}} the [[Red Gyarados]].\n* [[Team Rocket]]\'s [[Project R|scheme]] of forcing Pokémon to [[evolution|evolve]] is foiled.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* [[Pryce]]\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n[[File:PMTV EP236.png|thumb|right|200px|{{tt|Pocket Monster TV|Who\'s That Pokémon}}]]\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Officer Jenny]]\n* [[Pryce]]\n* [[Lance]]\n* {{OBP|Tyson|Team Rocket}}\n* [[Professor Sebastian]]\n* {{tc|Team Rocket Grunt}}s\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP EP236.png|thumb|200px|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Dunsparce}} \'\'(US and international)\'\', {{p|Dragonite}} \'\'(Japan)\'\'\n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Togepi}} ({{OP|Misty|Togepi}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Bayleef}} ({{OP|Ash|Bayleef}})\n* {{p|Cyndaquil}} ({{OP|Ash|Cyndaquil}})\n* {{p|Arbok}} ({{OP|Jessie|Arbok}})\n* {{p|Dewgong}} ([[Pryce]]\'s)\n* {{p|Dragonite}} ({{OP|Lance|Dragonite}})\n* {{p|Gyarados}} ([[Lance]]\'s; [[Red Gyarados]]; new)\n* {{p|Fearow}} ({{OBP|Tyson|Team Rocket}}\'s; ×2)\n\n==Trivia==\n* Because of the circumstances, {{an|Brock}} does not flirt with the [[Officer Jenny]] that appears in this episode.\n* [[Jessie]] references {{wp|He-Man}} and the {{wp|X-Men}}.
