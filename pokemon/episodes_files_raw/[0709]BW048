(Japanese: '''激走！バトルサブウェイ！！（後編）''' ''Flat-out Run! Battle Subway!! (Part 2)'') is the 48th episode of the {{series|Best Wishes}}, and the 705th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on September 15, 2011 as part of a one-hour special alongside [[BW047]], in the United Kingdom on December 28, 2011 and in the United States on January 7, 2012.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/14_48-battle-for-the-underground/-->\n<i>Team Rocket’s sinister plot to steal all the Poké Balls from the Nimbasa City Pokémon Center continues at a frenetic pace, and our heroes, along with Subway Bosses Ingo and Emmet, are in hot pursuit! They chase down one decoy after another, until Cilan figures out that the real Ghost Train must be heading for the rail yard in Anville Town.\n\nMeanwhile, our heroes’ trapped Pokémon have been trying to escape! Working together, they finally manage to break through their cages, and then figure out how to release the coupler that links their car to the Ghost Train. Back in the subway tunnels, Emmet’s Eelektross provides the needed boost for our heroes’ railcar to catch up with the Ghost Train in Anville Town, and Ingo’s Chandelure joins the fight to help them defeat Team Rocket.\n\nAlthough Pikachu is still seething about Meowth’s betrayal, Ash tells Meowth that he really enjoyed their time together traveling to Nimbasa City. Team Rocket and Dr. Zager escape in their helicopter, vowing to come back to fight another day. Meanwhile, Ash is looking forward to his long-delayed battle with Elesa, Nimbasa City’s Gym Leader!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{TRT}} continues to inhibit {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} from picking up their trail by deploying many ghost train decoys, overloading the subway sensors with phantom contacts. {{AP|Pikachu}} and {{TP|Iris|Axew}} are still trapped in their cages along with the stolen [[Poké Ball]]s. Meanwhile, Ash and his friends are still on the tracks. They spot a train approaching and Ash takes it in at a glance, concluding that it was a ghost car. With no way to tell the ghost trains apart, {{an|Cilan}} knows that it was part of Team Rocket's plan to escape.\n\n[[Dr. Zager]], flying a transport helicopter towards [[Nimbasa City]], checks in with {{MTR}} and the others. Meanwhile, Pikachu tries to break the door with {{m|Iron Tail}}, but it fails to damage it. The recoil sends Pikachu flying back, knocking a {{i|Poké Ball}} down. Pikachu looks at the Poké Ball, upset.\n\nAsh and his friends try to pursue another train, but fail to catch it and mark it as a decoy. Cilan believes that Team Rocket might have slipped through the radar already, above ground. The note surprises Ash and {{an|Iris}}, thinking subway trains stay underground. The coincidental quote gives Cilan the answer that the train's entry point is possibly the exit point. {{FB|Subway Boss|Ingo}} and {{FB|Subway Boss|Emmet}} support the theory by pointing out that the subway trains all originate from the [[Anville Town]] Yard. With this knowledge, Ingo and Emmet plan to join up with Ash and his friends, racing down to a spare train car.\n\nBack in Team Rocket's train, Axew cries hysterically at being imprisoned, but Pikachu comforts it before spotting the Poké Ball holding [[Ash's Snivy]]. Pikachu uses an {{m|Electro Ball}} to activate the Poké Ball and release Snivy. Snivy then uses {{m|Vine Whip}} to fish out [[Iris's Excadrill]]. Excadrill uses {{m|Metal Claw}} to free Axew and Pikachu from their cages. Pikachu tries to Iron Tail the door again, but only leaves a small dent. Axew tries to use {{m|Dragon Rage}} against it, but the attack also fails. Snivy releases [[Cilan's Pansage]] from captivity. {{m|Bullet Seed}} and Excadrill tackling the door, also fail to break it.\n\nPikachu thinks about the other {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that could help. After rejecting {{AP|Oshawott}}'s {{m|Razor Shell}}, {{AP|Scraggy}}'s {{m|High Jump Kick}}, and {{AP|Tepig}}'s {{m|Tackle}}, Pikachu decides to have {{TP|Cilan|Dwebble}} and use its corrosive spray to destroy the door.\n\nAsh and his friends continue to run along the tracks with Ingo and Emmet catch up to them on their tram, powered by Emmet's {{p|Eelektross}}. After Ash checks it with his [[Pokédex]], they hop on and race after the train. Meanwhile, Dwebble manages to carve a hole out of the door. A part of the door drops, alerting Team Rocket. Meowth goes to check and opens the door, coming face-to-face with Ash's Pikachu. Though shocked at first, Pikachu soon becomes fit with rage at the betrayal, charging up electricity. The train heads out to the surface, and Meowth knows that the Pokémon cannot escape since the train is traveling too fast for them to jump.\n\nPikachu attempts to fire a {{m|Thunderbolt}} at Meowth, but he shuts the door and blocks the attack. Meowth notifies [[Jessie]] and [[James]] about the situation and Dr. Zager proceeds to catch up with them. Back in the second car, [[Ash's Roggenrola]] and {{AP|Tepig}} join the group as Pikachu directs them to destroy the coupling holding the two cars together. A combination attack of {{m|Flash Cannon}}, {{m|Ember}}, Dragon Rage and Bullet Seed works cooperatively to destroy the coupling. Meowth reopens the door and realizes what is happening when Pikachu's Thunderbolt attack creates an explosion, knocking Meowth back and separating the cars. Jessie and James learn what's happened and start to slow the train down in order to allow the second car to catch up.\n\nPikachu looks ahead and notices that the track splits off. Ash's Snivy jumps on top of the car and uses Vine Whip to change the track's orientation, allowing the second car to head away from Team Rocket. They are forced to backtrack to the switch line, but now they're chasing the car and quickly start to catch up, with Dr. Zager's chopper along the side.\n\nAsh and his friends continue to race towards the terminus, reaching the surface. Eelektross uses more power to speed up the train to insane velocities. Meanwhile, Dr. Zager tries to position the chopper above the loose car to hitch it to the helicopter. Pikachu and Pansage attempt to attack the chopper's hooks, but the attacks fail to damage it. Meowth notices Ash and his friends approaching on a parallel track. Ash and his friends want to head over to the train car with their Pokémon, but it is almost impossible to get to them at the rate of speed they are traveling at. \n\nIngo brings out his partner, a {{p|Chandelure}}, and has it use {{m|Psychic}} to lift Ash and his friends to the car. The Pokémon are happily reunited with their Trainers as they prepare to fight off Team Rocket. Tepig and Roggenrola use Ember and Flash Cannon to propel the car faster, moving ahead of Zager's helicopter. Axew attempts to use Dragon Rage to help, but Zager’s chopper simply flies up and picks up speed, making the Pokémon’s efforts moot.\n\nSeeing another track switch, Cilan has Pansage use Bullet Seed to change the car's track orientation, slipping from Zager’s grasp once again. Roggenrola and Tepig use their attacks again to accelerate away. When Zager attempts to catch up with them, Snivy uses {{m|Leaf Storm}} to attack the chopper's main blades. Pikachu’s Electro Ball attack destroys the four cargo hooks on the helicopter, forcing Zager to back off. The trio attempts to catch up, but Roggenrola and Tepig do their best to push ahead. Tepig taps into more power, learning how to use {{m|Flamethrower}} in the process. Chandelure joins the fray and uses {{m|Will-O-Wisp}} on the locomotive, destroying it. Team Rocket jumps up with their jet packs, dodging the damage. Though upset by the betrayal, Ash does admit to having fun while traveling with Meowth, but the Scratch Cat Pokémon is unimpressed and swears revenge on them. James pushes a button to destroy the locomotive unit as they get into Zager's helicopter and fly off, much to Pikachu's anger. Cilan notes that Team Rocket did think of a good plan, while Iris is only relieved that she didn't manage to capture Meowth after all.\n\nOn the helicopter, Team Rocket are furious that their plan failed despite all the work and having come so close, but decide to look ahead and prepare another plot. Meanwhile, Ash's group checks out the Anville Town railyard, much to Cilan's enjoyment. Ingo and Emmet report that the subway has completely recovered and the stolen Poké Balls have been returned to the [[Pokémon Center]]. Ash knows he can now go and challenge the [[Nimbasa Gym]] and Ingo and Emmet wish him luck while warning that the [[Gym Leader]], [[Elesa]], is very tough. Ash isn't worried by this, however.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
