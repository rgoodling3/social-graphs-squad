Pokémon Contest - {{tt|Kinagi|Pacifidlog}} Convention! (Part One)\'\') is the 115th episode of the {{series|Advanced Generation}}, and the 389th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on February 17, 2005, in the United Kingdom on January 31, 2006 and in the United States on April 1, 2006.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/08_23-mean-with-envy/-->\n<i>Pacifidlog at last! May is practicing for her contest, and Ash wants Snorunt to practice Ice Beam. But Snorunt\'s wild aim hits Team Rocket instead and scares another Coordinator\'s Aipom. Skitty chases it, and May chases Skitty. She finds Skitty playing with another Coordinator, Joshua, and the two talk about the upcoming contest. Erica, a Coordinator who really likes Joshua, loses her cool when she sees them together and gives May a piece of her mind.\n\nAsh and the others show up, but so does Team Rocket! The villains grab Pikachu and Snorunt, so May and Joshua team up to stop them. Erica\'s so mad that May and Joshua are working together, she has Jynx use Hyper Beam to send Team Rocket flying. Then it\'s time to register for the contest, where Team Rocket also has a plan to enter the contest—with Meowth!\n\nThe first competitor in the Pacifidlog Contest is the Jester and her Meowth. Both of them look awfully familiar, as does the Giovanni ice sculpture Meowth carves using Fury Swipes! Joshua, Erica, and May all do well and move onto the second round along with the Jester. To May\'s shock, she\'ll be facing Joshua in the second round! Erica wants Joshua to win so they can win the ribbon together, but there\'s no way May is going to give up!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nFinally in [[Pacifidlog Town]], May enthusiastically prepares for the upcoming [[Pokémon Contest]]. Though she already has four [[Ribbon]]s, she needs one more to enter the [[Hoenn Grand Festival]]. Because the Pacifidlog Contest is chronologically the last Pokémon Contest to be held before the [[Grand Festival]], May must win this Contest Ribbon to be eligible to enter the competition. With that as motivation, May and {{cat|May\'s Pokémon|her Pokémon}} start working on their performance moves. Just then, {{TP|May|Skitty}} chases after an {{p|Aipom}}, May runs into fellow {{pkmn|Coordinator}} {{OBP|Joshua|Coordinator}}.\n\nMeanwhile, {{Ash}} is motivated by all of May\'s hard work to start training for the [[Hoenn League]] [[Pokémon League Conference|Championship]], itself not far off. He calls out {{AP|Snorunt}} to work on {{m|Ice Beam}}, which proves difficult for the playful Pokémon at first. Snorunt has soon mastered the force behind the [[move]], but has no control over it. Nearby, {{TRT}} wastes no time in making an attempt on {{AP|Pikachu}}, though their impromptu spring from nearby bushes is cut short as a rogue Ice Bean freezes them solid. Snorunt use Ice Beam several more times, causing chaos for the nearby Trainers.\n\nElsewhere, May and Joshua have become acquainted. Joshua, a Pacifidlog Town resident, has entered the Pokémon Contest and is a local favorite. However, as May and Joshua chat, [[Erica]], Joshua\'s girlfriend and also Coordinator, wrongly concludes that May is after Joshua romantically. As Erica watches and fumes from a distance, May reveals that she hasn\'t selected a Pokémon for the Contest yet. As Joshua comments that she should consider her Skitty because of its cuteness, Erica emerges from hiding. As Erica puts forth several accusations against May, she explains her master plan to go to the Contest finals together with Joshua and reveals her Pokémon, {{p|Jynx}}. Eventually, Ash, Brock, and Max find May, and the trio of Coordinators go to register at the [[Contest Hall]] together.\n\nOn the way, Team Rocket has regrouped and launches a balloon-born assault on the party -- however, [[May\'s Combusken]] quickly dismisses the balloon with a {{m|Sky Uppercut}} and Joshua\'s {{p|Houndoom}} rebukes Team Rocket\'s ragtag offensive. The addition of Skitty\'s {{m|Assist}} and Jynx\'s {{m|Hyper Beam}} send Team Rocket blasting off. May and Erica begin arguing over the battle, but Joshua points out that if they keep fighting, they will miss the registration deadline. May and Erica agree to resolve their argument on stage. Meanwhile, Team Rocket has landed and Jessie and Meowth enter the Contest in the persona of "The Jester". Ash resolves to keep training with Snorunt outside of the Contest Hall, leaving Brock and Max to root for May.\n\nThe Pacifidlog Contest begins as [[Vivian Meridian]] introduces the [[Contest Judge]]s: [[Raoul Contesta]] from the [[Pokémon Activities Committee]], [[Mr. Sukizo]] from the [[Pokémon Fan Club]], and the [[Nurse Joy]] from the local [[Pokémon Center]]. She [[Contest announcer|announces]] the start of the [[Appeal|Appeals Round]] as Jessie, disguised as "The Jester" and {{MTR}} take the stage. The performance consists of Meowth using {{m|Fury Swipes}} to carve out ice sculptures of {{an|Giovanni}} and {{TP|Giovanni|Persian}}, the latter which he then reshapes into a Meowth. On his turn, Joshua commands his Houndoom to [[Contest combination|combine]] {{m|Shadow Ball}} and {{m|Swift}} for sensational effect. Erica\'s Jynx combines {{m|Blizzard}} and {{m|Psychic}} while May combines an {{m|Assist}}-spawned {{m|Razor Leaf}}, a Blizzard, and {{m|Double Slap}} to shower the hall in sparkling crystal. All four Coordinators advance to the [[Contest Battle|Battle Round]]. May is assigned to fight Joshua, and Erica will square off against Jessie.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrive in [[Pacifidlog Town]].\n* {{an|May}} enters the Pacifidlog {{pkmn|Contest}} and advances to the [[Contest Battle]]s.\n* {{Ash}} starts {{pkmn|training}} {{AP|Snorunt}} to use {{m|Ice Beam}} properly.\n* May learns that the [[Hoenn Grand Festival]] will start in a month.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* [[Erica]]\n* {{OBP|Joshua|Coordinator}}\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* {{an|Giovanni}} (fantasy)\n* [[Erica]]\n* {{OBP|Joshua|Coordinator}}\n* [[Vivian Meridian]]\n* [[Raoul Contesta]]\n* [[Mr. Sukizo]]\n* {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:PTC AG115.png|thumb|200px|right|Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]\n[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]: {{p|Hoppip}}\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Chimecho}} ({{OP|James|Chimecho}})\n* {{p|Snorunt}} ({{OP|Ash|Snorunt}})\n* {{p|Combusken}} ({{OP|May|Combusken}})\n* {{p|Beautifly}} ({{OP|May|Beautifly}})\n* {{p|Skitty}} ({{OP|May|Skitty}})\n* {{p|Bulbasaur}} ({{OP|May|Bulbasaur}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Cacnea}} ({{OP|James|Cacnea}})\n* {{p|Persian}} ({{OP|Giovanni|Persian}}; fantasy)\n* {{p|Jynx}} ([[Erica]]\'s)\n* {{p|Houndoom}} ({{OBP|Joshua|Coordinator}}\'s)\n* {{p|Persian}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Nidoran♂}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Rhydon}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Marill}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Azumarill}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Aipom}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Espeon}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Phanpy}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Mightyena}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Zigzagoon}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Shroomish}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Azurill}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Roselia}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Trapinch}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Swablu}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Castform}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Spheal}} (Coordinator\'s)\n\n==Trivia==\n* {{an|Brock}} thinks that the ice sculpture of {{an|Giovanni}} "looks awfully familiar", thus making \'\'[[Mewtwo Returns]]\'\' [[canon]], as that is the only time when Brock has met him before.\n* The English dub title is a pun on the idiom "\'\'green with envy\'\'".\n* This is the third time {{Ash}} has {{pkmn|training|trained}} on an attack during a [[Pokémon Contest]]. The [[AG013|first one]] was {{AP|Pikachu}} and {{m|Iron Tail}}, the [[AG091|second]] was {{AP|Swellow}} and {{m|Aerial Ace}}, and this one was {{AP|Snorunt}} and {{m|Ice Beam}}.\n* This marks the {{pkmn|anime}} debut of {{p|Jynx}}\'s redesign.\n** As a result, this also marks Jynx\'s first appearance in the [[dub]] since \'\'[[EP099|A Mandarin Island Miss Match]]\'\', 290 episodes prior, due to the controversy surrounding her old design ([[EP250]] was not dubbed and \'\'[[AG013|All Things Bright and Beautifly!]]\'\' had a scene with a Jynx cut because of this).\n* The way [[Erica]] and {{OBP|Joshua|Coordinator}} split the {{to|Pacifidlog}} [[Ribbon]] in Erica\'s fantasy resembles the way Ash and {{an|May}} would eventually split the {{DL|Ribbon|Terracotta Medal}} [[AG192|77 episodes later]].\n* Erica\'s dream of winning the Pacifidlog Contest together with Joshua is impossible in practice. As established later on in \'\'[[AG175|Going for Choke!]]\'\', [[Contest Battle]]s ending in a tie must be decided in a {{wp|Sudden death (sport)|sudden-death round}}.\n\n===Errors===\n* When {{MTR}} says "No Persian is gonna make a {{p|Mankey}} outta me!", the {{wp|closed captioning}} referred the dialogue as "No Persian is gonna make a \'\'Monkey\'\' outta me!"\n* When Meowth changes the {{p|Persian}} statue into himself, it exclaims "Nyarth", the Japanese name for Meowth.\n* When Erica hugs her Jynx, one of Jynx\'s arms is colored purple, not red, yet right after it moves its arm, it becomes red.\n* [[Jessie]] comments that Meowth is a rare example of a Pokémon that can understand human speech. However, all Pokémon can understand human speech. It is possible that she was referring to understanding \'\'how to speak\'\' human speech and understanding the words themselves, which Meowth had to do as chronicled in \'\'[[EP070|Go West, Young Meowth]]\'\'.\n* When Joshua\'s {{p|Houndoom}} uses its attacks, it says its Japanese name for the whole episode.\n* Near the end of the episode, when it shows who went up to the second round, a "white line" is not present on top of Erica.\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n====[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]====\n* Question: Trainers, which Pokémon comes first?\n* Choices: {{p|Skiploom}}, {{p|Hoppip}}, {{p|Jumpluff}}\n* Answer: OK, Trainers!
