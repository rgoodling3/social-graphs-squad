The Legend of the {{tt|Radiant One|Blinding One}}!!\'\') is the 90th episode of the {{series|Sun & Moon}}, and the 1,029th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on September 13, 2018, in New Zealand on January 8, 2019, in Canada on January 19, 2019, and in the United States on February 9, 2019.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/21_46-securing-the-future/-->\n<i>The Ultra Guardians, along with Faba and Professor Kukui, are attempting to return The Blinding One to its original form! As Necrozma in its “UB Black” form, it’s holding Solgaleo captive and threatening Poipole’s home world.\n\nOur heroes have been attempting to “feed” Necrozma with Z-Power to restore its light, but it’s not enough. That’s when the people of Alola band together to send their own power to Necrozma—and it works! The Blinding One is restored, and Solgaleo is released. \n\nPoipole’s world is renewed, too, and Poipole decides to stay behind to protect it. As a goodbye present, it draws a loving portrait of Ash and Pikachu!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nContinuing where the [[SM089|previous episode]] left off, {{Ash}}, {{an|Lana}}, {{an|Kiawe}}, and {{an|Gladion}} had their Pokémon use their [[Z-Move]]s on {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Necrozma|Dusk Mane}} {{DL|Light trio (anime)|Necrozma}}, hoping to make it separate from {{DL|Light trio (anime)|Solgaleo|Nebby}}. Instead, Dusk Mane Necrozma absorbs the [[Z-Power]] from the four Z-Moves before attacking [[Ultra Guardians]] with {{m|Prismatic Laser}}.\n\nBack in [[Alola]], the residents of [[Melemele Island]], [[Akala Island]], and [[Ula\'ula Island]] get ready for the [[Manalo Festival]] as an eclipse begins to form. On [[Ten Carat Hill]], as [[Gozu]] receives a call from [[Matori]] ordering him to get back to the helicopter. At Gozu’s command, the {{tc|Team Rocket Grunt}}s leave him behind to continue his {{pkmn|battle}} against {{an|Professor Kukui}} and {{an|Faba}}. Gozu states that the eclipse will bring about the era of the Matori Matrix and has {{me|Aggron}} use another {{m|Heavy Slam}}. Kukui asks Faba to keep a secret from Ash and {{Ashcl}} as he sends out {{TP|Professor Kukui|Incineroar}} and has it use {{m|Darkest Lariat}}, blocking Mega Aggron\'s attack. Gozu tries to have Mega Aggron use {{m|Flash Cannon}}, but Kukui has Incineroar use its signature Z-Move, {{m|Malicious Moonsault}} to defeat Mega Aggron, reverting it back into a normal Aggron. Faba thinks about Kukui\'s words, and then, he sees the Masked Royal\'s image in Kukui, realizing that two are the same person. Excited by this revelation, Faba reveals that he\'s a big fan of the Masked Royal and opens up his lab coat to reveal a Masked Royal shirt. Kukui is surprised by this and invites Faba to do the finishing pose together. Gozu recalls Aggron and retreats back to the helicopter. The Matori Matrix attempts to enter the [[Ultra Wormhole]], but they are hindered once again when {{DL|Guardian deities (anime)|Tapu Koko}} uses {{m|Dazzling Gleam}} to pierce through their helicopter. The helicopter once again sustains damage, prompting Matori to retreat.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Poipole\'s world]], the Ultra Guardians recover as Dusk Mane Necrozma roars and charges toward the Ultra Guardians, but {{DL|Light trio (anime)|Lunala}} tackles it out of the way. Ash, {{an|Kiawe}}, {{an|Sophocles}}, and {{an|Gladion}} send out {{AP|Rowlet}}, {{AP|Lycanroc}}, {{AP|Torracat}}, {{TP|Kiawe|Turtonator}}, {{TP|Sophocles|Charjabug}}, {{TP|Gladion|Umbreon}}, and {{TP|Gladion|Lycanroc}} to help out. Back in Alola, Tapu Koko begins sending energy into the Ultra Wormhole as {{an|Lusamine}} and [[Professor Burnet]] in the base wonder what it\'s doing, then [[Wicke]] reports that they have regained communications with the Ultra Guardians. Back in Poipole\'s world, the Ultra Guardians are contacted by the [[Aether Foundation]] staff. The Ultra Guardians report that they\'re in Poipole\'s world and that they\'ve discovered UB Black is the "Blinding One" who lost its light, confirming Burnet\'s discovery. The Ultra Guardians further report back with the "Blinding One\'s" true name and reveal that their attempt to restore Necrozma with their Z-Power had failed. Burnet figures that they need more power and reveals more about the mural; it wasn\'t just {{p|Solgaleo}} and {{p|Lunala}} that shared their light with the "Blinding One", the people and Pokémon of Alola also shared their light with it. As Sophocles wonders how to do it, Burnet sees what Tapu Koko is doing and figures they have to do what it\'s doing. The Ultra Guardians and their Pokémon all make Tapu Koko\'s pose and Lusamine sends the [[Island Kahuna]]s a message to ask for their help.\n\n[[Hala]], [[Olivia]], and [[Nanu]] get the word and ask for help from the people gathered with them to send their power to the "Blinding One". The [[Guardian deities]], [[Island Kahuna]]s, Lusamine, Wicke, and Burnet send their power through the Ultra Wormhole, making Dusk Mane Necrozma back away from Lunala. As the Ultra Guardians send their own power, {{AP|Poipole}} gets its hive to join in sending power. Back in Alola, the people and Pokémon pitch in and more power goes through the Ultra Wormhole. {{TRT}} sees this and as they watch, they feel their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|balloon]] shaking and see {{an|Bewear}} grabbing onto it, which causes the balloon to crash. Bewear sends her power into the Ultra Wormhole as well, and at its request, [[Jessie]] and [[James]] sends out {{TP|Jessie|Mimikyu}} and {{TP|James|Mareanie}} to join them. As all of Alola\'s power makes it through the Ultra Wormhole, Lunala adds in some of its own. Necrozma receives the power and glows as it separates from Nebby, who collapses. Necrozma reassembles itself, but it is enraged and charges towards the Ultra Guardians, firing another Prismatic Laser.\n\nBack in Alola, the Island Kahunas use their Z-Moves to send Z-Power into the Ultra Wormhole. Back with Necrozma, it creeps up towards the Ultra Guardians, when it receives the Z-Power and turns its attention to Nebby and Lunala. Gladion boards {{TP|Gladion|Silvally}} and has it fire {{m|Air Slash}} to distract Necrozma from Nebby and Lunala. Lunala calls out to Gladion and throws him a [[Lunalium Z]]. Mallow and Ash run to Nebby\'s side and feed it a [[Sitrus Berry]], allowing it to recover. At Gladion\'s request, Ash equips his [[Z-Power Ring]] with his [[Solganium Z]] and asks Nebby to lend him its power again. As Necrozma approaches, Ash and Gladion stand side by side with Nebby and Lunala behind them and charge up their Z-Moves, hitting Necrozma with a combination of {{m|Searing Sunraze Smash}} and {{m|Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom}}. Necrozma\'s body changes from black to shining gold as the parts split up and reassemble, held together by light in a draconic appearance; Necrozma is finally restored to its {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Necrozma|original form}}.\n\nThe Ultra Guardians all gaze in awe of Ultra Necrozma and report the mission\'s success to Lusamine, Burnet, and Wicke as the eclipse in Alola comes to an end. Ultra Necrozma then uses its power to restore the world, bringing light back into it and revitalizing the floral life. The Ultra Guardians marvel at the restored state of the world as Poipole dances happily. Then, a call from Burnet alerts the Ultra Guardians that the Ultra Wormhole is about to close. However, Poipole decides to remain behind, wanting to help protect its world. Ash shares a tearful goodbye with Poipole before leaving. Poipole holds back its tears and starts drawing an image on the sand, which is revealed to be an image of Ash and {{AP|Pikachu}}\'s faces with thunderbolt shapes next to them. Mallow states that Poipole is saying "Like, Like, Love" to them and Ash says it right back to Poipole as the Ultra Guardians wave goodbye before they go through the Ultra Wormhole and arrive back in Alola. Team Rocket see it as their chance to capture Nebby and Lunala, but Bewear carries them away before they can. Then, Ultra Necrozma appears as a golden light in Alola\'s sky for all to see before slowly dissipating.\n\nSometime later at the [[Pokémon School]], Kukui has his coat buttoned up and greets the class lazily with a depressing aura. The class is fearful that the Ultra Aura drain might have happened again, but Kukui replies that it\'s just a cold, much to the class\'s shock. Ash decides to do the greeting again and the class, with everything they have, loudly shouts, "Alola!"\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:Ash Poipole farewell.png|thumb|220px|Poipole waving goodbye]]\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

starting with the following episode, new episodes aired on Sundays at 6:00 PM on [[TV Tokyo]].\n* The Japanese title for this episode is a reference to the opening [[Future Connection]].\n* The three female {{pkmn|Trainer}}s with a {{p|Sableye}}, {{p|Pikachu}}, and {{p|Eevee}}, respectively, are based on the singers in the band that performs the opening Future Connection, {{jwp|ЯeaL}}.\n** The Pikachu wears one of the hairstyles that were later introduced in [[Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu! and Let\'s Go, Eevee!]].\n* This is the first main series episode where the [[mother and daughter]] have appeared.\n** However, they made a cameo appearance during the [[Mega Evolution Pokédex Short]] in [[XY050]].\n* The [[Pokémon Sun and Moon]] {{pkmn|Champion}} and [[Elite Four]] themes are used as insert songs.\n* When {{TRT}} decides to share their light with Necrozma, [[James]] recites a line from their {{DL|Team Rocket mottos|Kanto, Orange Archipelago, Johto, and Hoenn|original motto}}.\n* The [[Who\'s That Pokémon?]] solution segment uses an alternate music in this episode.\n* Unlike most episodes, the opening credits were not shown until when Future Connection was played during the flashbacks of Ash\'s time with {{AP|Poipole}} near the end of the episode.\n** In addition, there was no title card for this episode. Instead, the episode title was displayed on top of a scene of the episode itself.\n* Ash and {{ashcl}} reference the lyrics of [[Alola!!]] at the end of the episode.\n* [[Ash\'s Pikachu]], {{Ash}}, and {{an|Kiawe}} narrate the preview of the [[SM091|next episode]].\n* This episode marks the first time that a character in the English dub refers to Matori by name.\n* The English dub of the episode was released on Amazon Video on January 30, 2019 and on the iTunes Store on February 3, 2019, ten and six days before it aired in {{pmin|the United States}}, respectively.\n\n===Errors===\n* When [[Matori]] contacts [[Gozu]] near the start of the episode, the Matori Matrix symbol on his hat is drawn with only one M.\n* In one of the previews shown for this episode, {{an|Gladion}} sends his {{p|Lycanroc}} out from a normal {{i|Poké Ball}} instead of an [[Ultra Ball]].\n* The blurb for this episode on the {{pmin|Brazil}}ian [[Pokémon TV]] misspells {{an|Faba}}\'s name as "Fabio" instead of "Fábio".\n\n===Dub edits===\n* Ash additionally narrates the title of the episode instead of merely displaying it as text onscreen as in the Japanese version. In the New Zealand TVNZ and {{pmin|Brazil|Brazilian Portuguese}}<!--, and {{pmin|Latin America}}n Spanish--> Cartoon Network broadcasts, the title is not displayed on-screen.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=90BDDC|bordercolor=F1912B\n|zh_cmn={{tt|通往未來！光輝大神的傳說！！|Connect to the Future!
