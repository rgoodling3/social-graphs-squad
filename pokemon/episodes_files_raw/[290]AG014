Jessie wants it, too. May ventures off on her own to catch her Wurmple, but Team Rocket follows and gives her trouble. Luckily, she gets some help from a trainer named Franklin. Meanwhile, Ash and Pikachu are practicing Pikachu\'s Iron Tail attack. A trainer named Franklin sees them practicing and challenges them to a battle. Franklin teaches Ash about double battles, which are common in the Hoenn region. With help from her new friend Franklin, May catches the Wurmple she wanted. When she and Franklin go to meet up with the gang, everyone is really surprised. The Franklins are actually identical twins—Forrest and Forrester Franklin! All is not lost for Team Rocket, however. Jessie manages to snag a Wurmple of her own before Team Rocket blasts off at the end of the episode.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} are walking along a forest path when a {{p|Wurmple}} suddenly drops down in front of {{an|May}}, frightening her. Ash scans it on his [[Pokédex]] and [[Max]] comments that it can [[Evolution|evolve]] into {{p|Beautifly}}. May immediately runs off to catch, leaving her friends to chase after her. Max and the others soon catch up to her, but May is set on catching the Wurmple after seeing [[Janet]]\'s [[AG013|Contest performance]] with her own Beautifly. {{an|Brock}} suggests that they stop for lunch, but May runs off alone to catch a Wurmple. Ash is concerned for May, but Max replies that May will come running back when she gets hungry and Brock declares that the experience of catching her first Pokémon is an important milestone. In the bushes nearby {{TRT}} are listening in, and decide that they will catch a bunch of Wurmple, and send one to {{an|Giovanni|the Boss}}, using the others to win all the [[Pokémon Contest]]s.\n\nWhile running through the forest, May comes across a group of {{p|Bellossom}} dancing. While she watches them, Team Rocket are looking for Wurmple nearby. [[James]] pushes gently on a tree to see if there are any Pokémon hiding in it, but [[Jessie]] tells him to do it properly, giving the tree a big kick. James is mildly impressed as a {{p|Weedle}} falls out of the tree. Jessie gives the tree another kick, making a {{p|Kakuna}} fall out. While Jessie continues to strike the tree repeatedly, James and {{MTR}} ponder their find, commenting that Weedle evolves into Kakuna. They realize that Kakuna evolves into {{p|Beedrill}} just they are swarmed by some Beedrill. May hears their screams and looks around to see Team Rocket running towards her. They tell her to run as they race passed, and she soon joins the runaway attempt. The Rocket trio and May escape the stingers after falling down an embankment. May cries out after being caught up with the trio, leading them to perform their {{motto}}. However, the motto recital is cut short when May races off to follow after a passing Wurmple. Meowth interrupts his teammate’s tirade and orders them to follow after that Wurmple. \n\nMay reaches Wurmple first, so she calls out {{TP|May|Torchic}} to battle it. Jessie sends out her {{TP|Jessie|Seviper}} which scares Torchic. May and Jessie argue over who gets to catch Wurmple. Jessie then orders Seviper to lash Wurmple with a {{m|Poison Tail}}, but Torchic uses a {{m|Peck}} attack to stop it in its tracks. Jessie is furious and orders James to do something, so he sends {{TP|James|Cacnea}} into the fray. Both Pokémon prepare to knock Torchic out, but a {{p|Heracross}} comes out of nowhere and batters them away with its horn. Its Trainer approaches and comments that two-on-one isn\'t fair. Team Rocket retaliate by ordering both of their Pokémon to attack Heracross, but he orders it to use {{m|Fury Attack}}, blasting them off. May thanks the Trainer, who introduces himself as [[Forrest Franklin|Franklin]] and offers to help May catch a Wurmple, to which she agrees. Meanwhile, Brock places a pot of stew over a fire to cook while Ash and {{AP|Pikachu}} practice {{m|Iron Tail}}. A Trainer soon approaches, and suggests they battle, also introducing himself as [[Forrester Franklin|Franklin]]. While the other Franklin and May climb a rocky cliff, Franklin explains [[Double Battle]]s to Ash. He says that they have been an accepted form of battling in [[Hoenn]] for as long as he can remember. Ash accepts the challenge.\n\nAfter Brock calls out the rules for their battle, Franklin sends out {{p|Yanma}} and {{p|Ariados}} and Ash sends out {{AP|Treecko}} to join Pikachu. With both sides raring to go, Brock calls for the match to begin. Ariados uses {{m|String Shot}}, which is dodged, and Yanma whips up a {{m|Sonic Boom}}. Ash orders Treecko and Pikachu to dodge, but Pikachu finds his back leg caught by one of the String Shot threads. Ash has Treecko free Pikachu in time, and the pair narrowly avoid the oncoming Sonic Boom. Ariados and Yanma use {{m|Night Shade}} and {{m|Swift}} respectively, and both Ash\'s Pokémon dodge repeated attacks before Pikachu {{m|Thunderbolt}}s Yanma. However, as Pikachu lands from the attack, he is struck down by a direct hit from Night Shade. Treecko reduces the damage by bumping Pikachu out of the attack. Ash then tells Treecko to use {{m|Quick Attack}}, forcing Franklin to focus his attacks on Treecko. Treecko dodges, allowing Pikachu to use Iron Tail on Yanma. Pikachu then tries to use Iron Tail on Ariados, but it fails, and Pikachu is knocked away by String Shot. Treecko {{m|Pound}}s Ariados with its tail, sending it flying into Yanma, who was still recovering from Iron Tail. Both Ariados and Yanma faint, so Brock declares Ash the winner. Franklin and Ash both check that their Pokémon are fine, and congratulate them on their efforts. Afterwards, Brock offers Franklin some stew.\n\nMay and the other Franklin are on the Wurmple hunt, when May brings back some [[Pecha Berry|Pecha Berries]] for the pair to enjoy. Franklin is impressed with May\'s confidence and self-sufficiency. He admits that he wouldn’t mind traveling with her and her friends, but he has always reconsidered his ambitions because of fear. Franklin then spots a Wurmple, so May sends out Torchic, which attacks Wurmple. May goes onto throw a {{i|Poké Ball}} at it, however Wurmple breaks out immediately. Franklin suggests that {{m|Ember}} would be a good attack to use so, after an Ember from Torchic, May catches Wurmple. However, when she celebrates, Team Rocket use a grabber to snatch it from her hand. Team Rocket performs their motto and Jessie proudly retrieves the Ball from the grabber. Franklin then sends out Heracross, which uses {{m|Horn Attack}} to pop their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|Meowth balloon]], causing Jessie to drop the Ball in the process. May runs after it and catches the Ball. Though Team Rocket aren\'t done yet, with Jessie and James ordering their out their Pokémon again. Seviper starts to use Poison Tail, and Cacnea prepares to use {{m|Pin Missile}}. May tells Torchic to counter it with Ember, but Cacnea dodges and hits Torchic with Pin Missile. Though Heracross effectively blocks the oncoming Poison Tail with its hands. Franklin tells May to attack with both Torchic and Wurmple at the same time. May follows suit, sending out Wurmple only to realize that she doesn\'t know what moves it can use. Franklin suggests String Shot, which then completely immobilizes both of Team Rocket\'s Pokémon. Torchic singes them with Ember, before Heracross\'s {{m|Megahorn}} sends them blasting off.\n\nFranklin informs Ash that he has just returned to the woods after doing some traveling. May, with Franklin accompanying her, runs up to the group to show them her new Wurmple, but the sight of two Franklins leaves the group baffled. The Franklin that was with Ash\'s group introduces himself as Forrester Franklin, and his twin, who was with May, introduces himself as Forrest Franklin. Forrest reveals that he has decided to travel with his Pokémon, and Forrester replies that he\'ll watch over the forest in the meantime. Brock suggests it is lunchtime. May sends out her Pokémon so that they can eat as well, but Wurmple polishes off all of the [[Pokémon food]] and Brock\'s stew, before walking over to May and falling asleep. Later, Team Rocket are hanging onto a tree branch on the side of a cliff. They start arguing, but stop when Meowth notices a Wurmple at the end of the branch. Jessie throws a Poké Ball and catches it, but as she retrieves the Ball, {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} pops out of his Ball, causing the branch to break from the weight, sending them plummeting.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} learns that [[Double Battle]]s are common in [[Hoenn]].\n* {{an|May}} catches a {{TP|May|Wurmple}}, making it her first [[caught Pokémon]].\n* [[Jessie]] also catches a {{TP|Jessie|Wurmple}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Wurmple}} ({{OP|May|Wurmple}} and {{OP|Jessie|Wurmple}})\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Forrest Franklin]]\n* [[Forrester Franklin]]\n* [[Janet]] (flashback)\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP AG014.png|thumb|200px|right|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Lugia}}\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Treecko}} ({{OP|Ash|Treecko}})\n* {{p|Torchic}} ({{OP|May|Torchic}})\n* {{p|Wurmple}} ({{OP|May|Wurmple}}, new; debut)\n* {{p|Forretress}} ({{OP|Brock|Forretress}})\n* {{p|Lotad}} ({{OP|Brock|Lotad}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Wurmple}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wurmple}}, new; debut)\n* {{p|Cacnea}} ({{OP|James|Cacnea}})\n* {{p|Beautifly}} ([[Janet]]\'s, flashback)\n* {{p|Heracross}} ([[Forrest Franklin|Forrest]]\'s)\n* {{p|Ariados}} ([[Forrester Franklin|Forrester]]\'s)\n* {{p|Yanma}} ([[Forrester Franklin|Forrester]]\'s)\n* {{p|Weedle}}\n* {{p|Kakuna}}\n* {{p|Beedrill}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Bellossom}} (multiple)\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[Advance Adventure]] is used as background music.\n* [[Forrest Franklin|Forrest]] and [[Forrester Franklin|Forrester]] first introduced themselves as Franklin, which is their surname.\n* The dub title is a reference to the saying "\'\'All in a day\'s work\'\'".\n* Not counting temporary Pokémon, this is the only episode in which two main characters {{pkmn2|caught|catch}} a Pokémon of a same species.\n* [[Jessie]] doesn\'t catch and keep a new Pokémon until \'\'[[DP080|The Thief That Keeps on Thieving!]]\'\', which aired over five years later.
