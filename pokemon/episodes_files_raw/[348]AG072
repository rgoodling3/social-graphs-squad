It first aired in Japan on April 15, 2004 and in the United States on April 2, 2005.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/07_32-the-bicker-the-better/-->\n<i>The kids are on their way to Fortree City, but May is delaying them. Ash starts to argue with her, and the two kids continue to bicker as they walk. They are interrupted by a couple named Andi and Oscar, who challenge May and Ash to a tag battle.\n\nAsh uses Corphish and May uses Skitty, facing off against the lovebirds\' Nidoking and Nidoqueen. Skitty\'s Assist move continually interferes with Corphish\'s attacks, so the two Trainers and their Pokémon begin to fight. Ash and May are defeated.\n\nAndi and Oscar encounter Team Rocket next. Jessie and James agree to battle only so they can steal the couple\'s Pokémon, but are soundly beaten. Jessie and James blame each other for the loss.\n\nThe two groups overhear each other fighting, and Jessie decides to team up in a tag battle with May against James and Ash. The battle starts to go in favor of the boys, prompting Jessie to send out another Pokémon. The fight between Skitty, Seviper, Cacnea, Corphish, and Dustox quickly goes out of control, until Meowth realizes that Team Rocket could steal Pikachu.\n\nThey grab Pikachu and run, but Ash and May team up to stop the thieves. After using their Pokémon to soundly defeat Team Rocket, Ash and May reconcile.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}}, {{an|Brock}}, and [[Max]] step outside the [[Pokémon Center]], ready to leave for [[Fortree City]]. However, {{AP|Pikachu}} warns the boys that {{an|May}} isn\'t ready yet. Ash goes back inside, finding her just finishing up packing. He resorts to pushing May out of the Center, but she stops in front of a mirror to fix her hair, further irritating Ash. May states that it\'s normal to do so, but Ash doesn\'t, shocking May. When Ash responds that he isn\'t a girl, May condescends him, making Ash even angrier. As the group walks, Ash and May rants about each other quickly escalates into an argument.\n\nThe group runs into the couple [[Oscar and Andi]], who challenge Ash and May to a [[Multi Battle|Tag Battle]], proclaiming the two a [[AdvanceShipping|couple]]. Although both deny the couple connection, Ash and May accept the challenge. Oscar summons {{p|Nidoking}} while Andi calls out her {{p|Nidoqueen}}. Ash selects {{AP|Corphish}}. May, however, considers her choice, but the delay annoys Ash. She eventually settles with {{TP|May|Skitty}}. Ash and May make the first move, with Corphish using {{m|Bubble Beam}} and Skitty uses {{m|Assist}} to unleash an {{m|Ember}} on Nidoking. However the two attacks collide, and as Corphish tries to alert Skitty to the situation, its ends up being attacked instead. As Ash and May start arguing, Andi and Oscar lash their opponents with a joint {{m|Dynamic Punch}} attack. Ash decides to retaliate, but Skitty\'s  {{m|Blizzard}} accidentally freezes Corphish in ice. May tries to correct her mistake, but Skitty\'s Assist turns into a {{m|String Shot}}, wrapping Corphish in silky threads. Max cannot believe May would try to use Assist because of the [[move]]s unpredictable nature. May, however, tries Assist twice more, and on the second go it melts the ice with Ember. Corphish is furious and begins chasing Skitty around, which leads Ash and May to argue again. Oscar and Andi pull the win when Corphish and Skitty are both hit with {{m|Submission}} from both Nidoking and Nidoqueen. Ash and May are left bickering even more.\n\nAndi and Oscar run off into the forest, where they soon find {{TRT}} and challenge to a Tag Battle. [[Jessie]] spots the couple\'s hefty Pokémon, declaring that Nidoking and Nidoqueen would make great gifts for {{an|Giovanni}}. With that in mind, [[James]] uses {{TP|James|Cacnea}} while Jessie choose {{TP|Jessie|Seviper}}. Seviper ends up attacking Cacnea, causing Jessie and James to argue, allowing Oscar and Andi to take the win with dual {{m|Hyper Beam}} attacks, sending the trio flying. The happy couple holds hands and declare that love really does conquers all.\n\nAsh and May are still fighting about the loss, blaming each other, while Max and Brock watch. Jessie and James are also bickering. The two arguing groups cross paths, and another Tag Battle ensures. James teams up with Ash while Jessie takes May. Although Ash and May are hesitant to fight, they decide to accept. The teams use the same Pokémon used in the previous Tag Battles. Corphish and Cacnea work better together than Seviper and Skitty, shifting the battle to James and Ash. Jessie starts to get angry at the thought of losing, so she summons {{TP|Jessie|Dustox}} to blow her opponents away with a {{m|Whirlwind}}. The boys protest at her breaking the rules, but she doesn\'t care. The battle quickly grows out of control when attacks start to fly undirected. Brock declares the women disqualified, but it is meaningless as Jessie has Dustox whip up another Whirlwind to deal with him. \n\nWhile the battle rages on, {{MTR}} realizes that the chaos could allow them to snatch Pikachu, so he manages to stop Jessie and James from fighting long enough to realize it. They create a diversion with Seviper\'s {{m|Haze}} and Cacnea\'s {{m|Sandstorm}}, while Meowth nabs Pikachu in a net. Team Rocket tries to run, but May\'s Skitty uses Assist-turned-String Shot to stop the Rocket trio. Corphish protects Skitty from Seviper\'s oncoming {{m|Poison Tail}}, rebuilding the trust between Ash and May. Skitty lashes Team Rocket with {{m|Double Slap}}, helping to free Pikachu. It follows up with Blizzard, freezing them solid in ice. May calls for a joint effort, so Corphish and Skitty use {{m|Crabhammer}} and {{m|Tackle}} respectively to send Team Rocket blasting off. Afterwards, Ash and May apologize to each other, officially ending their fight.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} learns about [[Multi Battle|Tag Battles]] and has his first official battle of that kind, along with {{an|May}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Oscar and Andi]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:PTC AG072.png|thumb|200px|right|Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]\n[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]: {{p|Onix}}\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Corphish}} ({{OP|Ash|Corphish}})\n* {{p|Skitty}} ({{OP|May|Skitty}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Dustox}} ({{OP|Jessie|Dustox}})\n* {{p|Cacnea}} ({{OP|James|Cacnea}})\n* {{p|Nidoking}} ([[Oscar and Andi|Oscar]]\'s)\n* {{p|Nidoqueen}} ([[Oscar and Andi|Andi]]\'s)\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[Advance Adventure]] is used as background music.\n* This episode [[Banned episodes#Banned episodes in other countries|was not aired]] in some countries due to the fact that the episode was regarded as a "battle of the sexes", which some saw as encouraging sexism.\n* The episode\'s dub title is a pun on the phrase "\'\'the bigger the better\'\'".\n* {{p|Blaziken}} is also legally correct on the [[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]] segment, as the {{type|Bug}} {{p|Ariados}} is weak against {{type|Fire}} moves.\n* Stock animal sounds are used for the cries of {{p|Nidoqueen}} and {{p|Nidoking}}.\n\n===Errors===\n* As {{an|May}} and {{Ash}} walk down the hallway in the [[Pokémon Center]], there is a poster with an upside-down {{i|Poké Ball}} at the bottom of it. After May inspects herself in the mirror, this poster is missing.\n* {{p|Onix}} is misspelled as \'\'Onyx\'\' in the Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice segment for this episode.\n* When May checks her [[Pokédex]] on [[Oscar and Andi|Andi]]\'s Nidoqueen, she is wearing Ash\'s gloves.\n* [[Jessie]] commands {{TP|Jessie|Dustox}} to use {{m|Pin Missile}} instead of {{m|Poison Sting}}. \n* During Ash and May\'s argument, May\'s left hand disappears.\n* {{an|Brock}} says that, according to the rules of Pokémon battles, no Trainer is allowed to use more than one Pokémon in any battle. This is, of course, not true. He may have meant "in any \'\'\'Single Battle\'\'\'", which was the norm back in [[Generation I|Generations I]] and [[Generation II|II]].\n* When Nidoqueen uses {{m|Hyper Beam}}, her lower jaw is colored blue.\n* During the tag battle, Jessie tells {{TP|Jessie|Seviper}} to use {{m|Wrap}} on {{TP|James|Cacnea}}, but instead, Seviper is seen using {{m|Poison Tail}}. \n* After {{TRT}} says their {{motto}}, the sound of {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}}\'s Poké Ball opening can be heard despite Wobbuffet already being outside.\n* When Cacnea, Seviper, {{AP|Corphish}}, Dustox, and {{TP|May|Skitty}} are all attacking each other, Skitty disappears for a few frames.\n* When Ash orders Corphish to dodge Nidoking and Nidoqueen\'s {{m|Submission}}, the z\'s under his eyes are missing.\n* When Nidoqueen is called out of the Poké Ball for the first time, she cries, but her mouth doesn\'t move.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* There is a two-second shot of Jessie performing an \'\'{{wp|akanbe}}\'\', which involves pulling her eyelid down and sticking out her tongue at the same time. Like in \'\'[[AG002|A Ruin with a View]]\'\' and \'\'[[EP006|Clefairy And The Moon Stone]]\'\', this was cut from the dub. This is mainly because it isn\'t a common gesture outside of Japan. However, other episodes featuring akanbe [[EP046|before]] and [[DP113|after]] this had no such edits, for reasons unknown.\n\n<gallery>\nAG072 deleted scene.png|Cut from the dub\n</gallery>\n\n====[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]====\n* Question: Trainers, which one of these Pokémon is the best choice to battle {{p|Ariados}}?\n* Choices: {{p|Raichu}}, {{p|Onix}}, {{p|Blaziken}}\n* Answer: Ok, Trainers!
