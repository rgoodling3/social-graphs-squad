It was first broadcast in Japan on October 2, 2003 and in the United States on October 2, 2004.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/07_04-a-togepi-mirage/-->\n<i>Shedinja attacks Misty and friends, but they are protected by Togepi using Safeguard. Everyone is then transported into the Togepi Paradise, located inside the mirage floating above the temple. There they find a group of sick Togepi. It is explained that Togepi are only well based on the emotions of those around them, and the evil plotting of Colonel Hansen is making them sick.\n\nColonel Hansen tries to break into the Togepi Paradise, and Misty's Togepi travels back to try and stop him. Instead Togepi is knocked out by Hansen's Shedinja and Ninjask. Misty and everyone else are transported back to the Mirage Kingdom.\n\nBack at the palace Hansen claims the throne, and has the king imprisoned. He kicks Team Rocket out. A ceremony begins in which Hansen is declared king. Outside, Team Rocket disguise themselves as fortune tellers to tell Brock where the king is being held.\n\nAsh, May, Misty, and Princess Sara confront Hansen at the palace, but Torchic and Pikachu are no match for Ninjask and Shedinja. The other Togepi suddenly emerge from the Togepi Paradise and channel their energy into Misty's Togepi, using Safeguard to protect everyone. Misty's Togepi evolves into a Togetic.\n\nMisty throws out her Gyarados and uses Flamethrower to roast all of Colonel Hansen's Pokémon. The king arrives and has Hansen arrested. Togetic decides to stay and protect the Togepi Paradise. All of the Togepi leave, except for one who jumps into Sara's arms. With that Togepi, the princess can now claim the Mirage Kingdom throne.\n\nEveryone bids Misty goodbye as she heads back to Cerulean City aboard a zeppelin.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{AP|Pikachu}}'s cheeks are sparking with electricity as [[Colonel Hansen]] orders his Pokémon to attack. His two {{p|Ninjask}} use {{m|Hyper Beam}} while {{p|Shedinja}} unleashes a {{m|Solar Beam}} at the group. {{an|Misty}} watches as {{TP|Misty|Togepi}} protects everyone from the attacks with a {{m|Safeguard}}. After that, {{Ash}}, {{an|Misty}}, and the others disappear, much to Colonel Hansen's dismay. They find themselves in a mysterious [[dimension]], which {{ho|Miranda}} calls the [[Togepi Paradise]]. She explains that the [[Mirage Kingdom]] and Togepi Paradise help to protect each other, but she is sad to say that a lot has changed since the last time she was here. Misty's Togepi leads everyone to some injured Togepi. {{an|May}} consults her [[Pokédex]] for a solution which details that Togepi has the ability to sense people's hearts, but its power will be weakened if it senses impurity in a Trainer. Hansen and his Pokémon manage to break into the Togepi Paradise, a feat which does not go unnoticed by Ash and the others. Togepi then floats towards Hansen, much to the surprise of everyone. With Togepi in his grasp, Hansen makes his way towards the palace to demand the throne from the [[King and Queen of the Mirage Kingdom|King]]. When the King refuses, Hansen sends the reigning monarchs to the dungeon. \n\nMisty is left fuming and attempts to break through the time-space barrier to the Mirage Kingdom. The weakened Togepi use their power to assist the group in returning. Later, as they make their way through town, {{an|Brock}} leads the discussion and states they have to defeat Colonel Hansen's {{t|Bug}} Pokémon. May replies that her {{type|Fire}} {{TP|May|Torchic}} would be perfect. Suddenly [[Jessie]] appears on a broadcast screen to announce that Colonel Hansen is now the Mirage Kingdom's regent. Miranda and the townspeople are a gasp, and [[Princess Sara]] is now deeply concerned for her parents. Meanwhile, {{TRT}}'s attention turns to their reward, but Hansen declares that he has no need for them anymore. The Rocket think it is a cruel joke, but realize Hansen has betrayed them after orders his Pokémon to send them blasting off.\n\n[[Ash's Taillow]] and [[May's Beautifly]] conduct an aerial search of the palace, but report back without any news. Miranda advises the group that the King and Queen are likely being kept in the tower, so Brock suggests they break into the palace. Ash, Misty, May and Princess decide that they will rescue Togepi while the others will search for the Sara's parents. As Brock and the others look for the King, [[List of Team Rocket's disguises|two fortune tellers]], who are actually Team Rocket in disguise, informs them of the King's location. After that, Team Rocket disappears with their revenge on Hansen for betraying them complete. Miranda says she’ll lead [[Max]] and Brock to the hinted location.\n\nMeanwhile, Colonel Hansen arrives at the coronation temple with Togepi in hand, and the priest officially declares him the new monarch of the Mirage Kingdom. He leaves the complex and orders Togepi to use {{m|Metronome}} to open the portal to the Togepi Paradise, however Ash and the others arrive to stop his plans. Colonel Hansen refuses to listen and instead orders his Pokémon to attack. May sends out Torchic, but she quickly [[recall]]s it after it is hit by a {{m|Shadow Ball}}. {{AP|Pikachu}}, however, manages to knock out both Ninjask with a {{m|Thunder}} attack. As Shedinja charges up a Solar Beam, a Safeguard intervenes, with the defenses source revealed to be the Togepi from the Paradise. The Paradise Togepi perform a Metronome and bestow a mysterious blue light on Misty's Togepi. Next, Togepi bursts with blue energy before evolving into {{p|Togetic}}. Ash and the others look quite bewildered by Togetic's new form. It flies up to the Paradise Toegpi and protects them from an oncoming Solar Beam, which irritates Colonel Hansen. Togetic causes the area to flare with bright white light. Misty smiles and tells Togetic to leave everything to her. She takes out a {{i|Poké Ball}}, kisses it, and calls out {{TP|Misty|Gyarados}}. Hansen is not fazed one bit, knowing that Gyarados's {{t|Water}} attacks are useless against his Shedinja. Misty does not back down and confidently orders Gyarados to use {{m|Flamethrower}}. The attack deals great damage to Shedinja, finally knocking it out. While everyone wonders why Gyarados can use Flamethrower, Misty states that Water Pokémon can learn Fire attacks too. The King and Queen, with their guards behind them, confront Hansen and he sent to the dungeon for his treachery. Team Rocket spy from a rooftop and pleased to Hansen being taken away.\n\nLater the Togepi appear cheerier than before and return to the Paradise. Togetic informs Misty that it wishes to stay behind in the Paradise and become its protector to prevent people like Hansen from causing harm. Misty and Togetic share one last tearful moment before bidding each other farewell. As Togetic enters the Togepi Paradise the sky mirage fades. Princess Sara assures Misty that she will protect the Paradise and Togetic from harm. Something is tugging at the Princess's dress, and Sara is surprised to see a Togepi. She is happy, because not only does she get a Togepi, but also she is also eligible to become the new ruler. Later, as Misty prepares to return back to [[Cerulean City]] and resume her [[Gym Leader]] duties, she wishes everyone the best of luck with their endeavors and invites them to visit her sometime. Ash and the others wave to Misty as she leaves back to [[Kanto]] in a blimp.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:Misty and Togetic.png|thumb|220px|Misty saying goodbye to Togetic]]\n* {{an|Misty}}'s {{p|Togepi}} learns {{m|Safeguard}} and later evolves into {{TP|Misty|Togetic}}.\n* {{Ash}} learns that Misty [[HS02|has obtained]] a {{TP|Misty|Gyarados}}.\n* Misty's Gyarados is revealed to know {{m|Flamethrower}}.\n* Misty {{pkmn2|released|leaves}} Togetic in the [[Mirage Kingdom]] and returns to [[Cerulean City]].\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Togetic}} ({{OP|Misty|Togetic}})\n\n=====Main series debuts=====\n* [[Misty's Gyarados]]\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Colonel Hansen]]\n* [[Princess Sara]]\n* {{ho|Miranda}}\n* [[King and Queen of the Mirage Kingdom]]\n* [[Mirage Kingdom]] Palace guards\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:PTC AG045.png|thumb|200px|right|Pokémon Trainer's Choice]]\n[[Pokémon Trainer’s Choice]]: {{p|Mudkip}}\n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Togepi}} ({{OP|Misty|Togetic}}; evolves)\n* {{p|Togetic}} ({{OP|Misty|Togetic}}; newly evolved; released; debut)\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Taillow}} ({{OP|Ash|Taillow}})\n* {{p|Gyarados}} ({{OP|Misty|Gyarados}})\n* {{p|Torchic}} ({{OP|May|Torchic}})\n* {{p|Beautifly}} ({{OP|May|Beautifly}})\n* {{p|Mudkip}} ({{OP|Brock|Mudkip}})\n* {{p|Shedinja}} ([[Colonel Hansen]]'s)\n* {{p|Ninjask}} ([[Colonel Hansen]]'s; ×2)\n* {{p|Togepi}} ([[Princess Sara]]'s; new)\n* {{p|Togepi}} ([[Togepi Paradise]]'s; multiple)\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[Because the Sky is There]] replaced [[Polka O Dolka]] as the [[List of Japanese ending themes|Japanese ending theme]].\n* This episode was aired in English exactly one year after its Japanese airdate.\n* With the exception of {{p|Porygon2}} (which wouldn't appear until [[M15|years later]], due to [[EP038|the incident]] involving its {{p|Porygon|pre-evolution}}), as of this episode, every [[Generation II]] Pokémon has appeared in the anime.\n* The Japanese voice artists for {{Ash}}'s first three female traveling companions are featured in this episode and the previous one; [[Mayumi Iizuka]] and [[KAORI.]] voice {{an|Misty}} and {{an|May}}, respectively; and [[Megumi Toyoguchi]], who voices [[Princess Sara]] in this episode, went on to play {{an|Dawn}} during the {{series|Diamond & Pearl}}.\n* Misty claims that {{t|Water}} Pokémon can also use {{t|Fire}} attacks.
