It first aired in Japan on August 2, 2018, in New Zealand on November 13, 2018, in Canada on December 8, 2018, and in the United States on December 22, 2018.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/21_40-the-shape-of-love-to-come/-->\n<i>While out shopping, Ash meets a talented artist named Mina, whose partner Ribombee has an amazing power: it can tell what people and Pokémon are feeling! Poipole is fascinated, too, and shows off its own drawing skills to the rest of the Pokémon School class. It’s thrilled to draw symbols representing its love for its “Alolan family,” but after a mysterious dream, its artwork takes on a different, darker tone. Although Poipole’s motivations remain unclear, our heroes reassure it that they’re behind it no matter what! In the meantime, though, the mystery continues to deepen...</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} has his Pokémon compete in mock {{pkmn|battle}}s against each other. {{AP|Rowlet}}\'s {{m|Razor Leaf}} proves to be an equal match against {{AP|Torracat}}\'s {{m|Flame Charge}}. {{AP|Lycanroc}} and {{AP|Pikachu}}’s training session is interrupted after {{AP|Poipole}} chases Lycanroc away. {{Rotom}} notices Poipole is performing a new [[move]], {{m|Fury Attack}}. Ash is initially pleased, but soon grabs Poipole by the tail to end the pursuit. He congratulates his Pokémon on the new move, and Poipole spins around and sprays everyone with ink. Ash notes Poipole\'s infatuation with Pikachu after it scribbles a Pikachu picture in the sand, which Rotom promptly records. {{an|Professor Kukui}} and [[Professor Burnet]] call out to Ash to tell him to rush home before they head off to do some shopping.\n\nWhile Kukui, Burnet and Ash are wondering through the [[Hau\'oli City]] marketplace, Poipole flies over to a female artist. It focusses in on a sun painting, taking the girl by surprise. Ash rushes over and instantly notices the artist\'s partner Pokémon, a {{p|Ribombee}}. She is pleased that Poipole likes her paintings, and her Ribombee promptly lands on Poipole\'s head and begins fluttering its wings. The artist translates the movements as "Like, Like, Love", and states that Poipole likes drawing. The insight takes everyone by surprise, but the girl explains that she can sort of understand Ribombee. Kukui adds that Ribombee has the ability to synchronize with a Pokémon and connect the Pokémon and a person\'s heart. Burnet notes that Ribombee uses [[aura]] to distinguish between flowers. [[Mina]] formally introduces herself to Ash, and add that she and Ribombee have been together for a long time.\n\nThe following day, Ash brings {{ashcl}} to meet Mina. The group are instantly enchanted by Mina\'s quality landscape paintings, and {{an|Mallow}} asks what she is painting next. To Ash\'s surprise it is a portrait of himself, his Pokémon, Rotom, Kukui, Burnet and her {{p|Munchlax}}. Poipole flies into the air and sprays everyone with red and blue ink. It then starts drawing a scene on the pavement which Mina copies into her sketchbook. She shows everyone else the thunderbolt-shaped drawing, which she adds is overflowing with emotion. Mina has Ribombee fly onto Poipole\'s head and flutter its wings to allow her to translate the Pokémon\'s emotions. She explains that Poipole\'s feelings mean "Like, Like, Love". Rotom notices Poipole\'s latest creation is much like its earlier sand drawing, both convey its affection towards Pikachu.\n\nAsh and Pikachu return to Kukui\'s home, where Burnet informs {{an|Lusamine}}, {{an|Faba}}, and [[Wicke]] of the latest development, that Poipole can illustrate its feelings. Rotom sends through the footage, which takes Wicke by surprise. Though Faba remains discerning and disappointed that it isn\'t scientific. Lusamine is fascinated and asks Ash to keep observing Poipole\'s behaviours. Kukui and Burnet, who are extremely excited to perform the [[Ultra Guardians]]\' signature sign off for the first time, alongside Ash say goodbye to the [[Aether Foundation]] with an "Ult-roger!".\n\nLater, Ash finds Poipole playing with Pikachu. He notices Poipole has made drawings of himself and his Alola family on the walls, and commends Poipole\'s artistic abilities. Rotom has Ash, Pikachu and Poipole pose in front of the mural, and takes a snap of them. Overnight, Poipole wakes up from its dream about a group of Poipole surrounding a {{DL|Ultra Beasts (anime)|Ultra Space Naganadel|Naganadel}} who lets out a loud roar. It flies outside and tears up as its look over at the moon.\n\nThe next day, at the [[Pokémon School]], Ash and his classmates discuss Mina\'s amazing artworks. Ash tilts his head slightly and notices Poipole\'s newest scribbling on the blackboard, it features Pikachu with lightning bolts around it and Poipole with tears next to it. Ash and Pikachu are instantly concerned, and Poipole flies into Ash\'s arms to cry.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Team Skull]] trio of [[Tupp]], [[Zipp]] and [[Rapp]] wonder through the Hau\'oli City markets hoping to stir up trouble. Rapp starts hugging various cute Pokémon, much to her team member\'s dismay. As she chases a {{p|Comfey}}, Rapp\'s attention turns to Mina\'s Ribombee. Rapp demands Mina hand over her Pokémon, and much to their surprise Mina insists that they have a battle, an art battle that is. Mina explains that an art battle involves a {{pkmn|Trainer}} drawing one of their own Pokémon. Thinking it won\'t be a difficult task, the trio of Grunts agree. Team Skull\'s Pokémon struggle to maintain their poses, while Mina soon finishes her Ribombee sketch. Zipp proudly displays his {{p|Garbodor}} drawing, while Rapp has drawn a cute-faced version of her {{p|Zubat}}, which Mina commends for showing off their respective passions. Tupp demands he and Mina reveal their sketches at the same time. Mina\'s drawing instantly impresses Zipp and Rapp. Unfortunately, Tupp\'s line drawing of his {{p|Salandit}} even embarrasses his Pokémon and Mina adds he should pay more attention to detail. Enraged, the {{tc|Team Skull Grunt}}s throw away their sketchbooks and demand a real battle. Mina expertly catches the drawing books and explains that she was going to call the art battle a draw, but the battle starts.\n\nSalandit launches a {{m|Toxic}} attack, but it is surprisingly intercepted by Poipole. Ash runs into the match, and proclaims that a one-on-three match is unfair. Tupp calls for another Toxic, while Rapp orders an {{m|Air Cutter}} and Zipp\'s Garbodor goes in for a {{m|Venoshock}}. Mina, with a stern look on her face, has Ribombee throws a {{m|Pollen Puff}} into Zubat\'s mouth. Pikachu\'s {{m|Iron Tail}} strikes Salandit, and Garbodor is beaten by Poipole\'s Fury Attack. The Team Skull Grunts recall their Pokémon and run away.\n\nRotom shows Poipole\'s blackboard painting to Mina. She uses Ribombee to help her translate Poipole\'s thoughts, which reports Poipole\'s current happiness. Mina explains that she sensed Poipole\'s overwhelming sadness because of a heavy burden. She adds that Poipole is on an unknown mission. Ash clarifies that he will support Poipole even though he does not understand Mina\'s revelations, which instantly cheers up the Pokémon. \n\nBack at home, Rotom spots Poipole painting a large-scale image on the ceiling. Ash enters the room, and Rotom adds that the sketch is of the {{p|Necrozma|Blinding One}} [[SM074|seen in]] one of [[Acerola]]\'s library books. He recalls Poipole\'s initial agitation, and Burnet adds that it has been a while since Ash\'s visit to [[Ula\'ula Island]]. Poipole\'s newly discovered "Like, Like, Love" connection to the Blinding One puzzles everyone.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
