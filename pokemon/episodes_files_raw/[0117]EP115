It was first broadcast in Japan on September 30, 1999 and in the United States on October 7, 2000. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/03_10-a-tent-situation/-->\n<i>Ash returns home, where he is pleasantly surprised by an old friend. Unfortunately he faces a new trial, as Team Rocket has besieged the famous Oak Laboratory and captured all the Poké Balls there.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrive at [[Pallet Town]], where he and {{an|Misty}} are surprised to see {{an|Brock}} waiting for them in Ash\'s house. When they ask why he left [[Professor Ivy]], Brock abruptly falls to the ground shivering, and Misty believes she dumped him. {{Delia}} arrives home, and explains that she and [[Mimey]] found him a week ago, lying on the ground in a grassland, and took him home. Since then, Brock has been helping around the house, with Brock fighting over the chores with Mimey. Later, whilst discussing over dinner, {{Tracey}} insists on seeing {{an|Professor Oak}}. Ash is reminded of the [[GS Ball]] and then shows his mother his [[Winner\'s Trophy]], which she suggests she could use as a dumbbell.\n\nAsh, {{AP|Pikachu}}, Misty, Tracey, and Brock travel to [[Professor Oak\'s Laboratory]], with {{TRT}} watching from a distance. Ash is welcomed to the house by {{AP|Muk}}, who is crushing Oak under his weight. Tracey ignores the situation and asks to show Oak his sketches. Ash hands Oak the GS Ball and he puts it away to examine it later. Oak then shows them around the Laboratory, and Ash sends his {{AP|Tauros}} out to rejoin the herd before encountering his other Pokémon, {{AP|Snorlax}} and {{AP|Kingler}}. Over some cups of tea, Oak begins to review Tracey\'s sketches. As Tracey nervously awaits Oak\'s approval, he is interrupted by {{MTR}} activating a circus net that engulfs the Laboratory. Meanwhile, {{an|Jigglypuff}} appears and tries to go through the net, though it cannot.\n\nTeam Rocket performs their {{motto}} while doing a circus act. Just as Ash is about to call out {{AP|Bulbasaur}}, he notices Muk\'s insistence and sends it out instead. Jessie sends out {{TP|Jessie|Lickitung}}, but Muk ignores Lickitung and goes on to smother Jessie. James sends out {{TP|James|Victreebel}}, which Muk hugs as well. James tries his luck with {{m|Razor Leaf}}, but it fails, and Muk deflects the leaves. Victreebel begins to swallow Muk, but soon spits it out in disgust. Lickitung slobbers all over Muk with its tongue, but it does nothing.\n\nJames commands Victreebel to use {{m|Sleep Powder}} on Muk, which works, much to Ash\'s surprise. Ash is about to call out {{AP|Squirtle}} and Bulbasaur, but Team Rocket then throws rings around him and the others, which immobilize them. A [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|Super Sucker]] then proceeds to suck all of the lab\'s [[Poké Ball]]s and Tracey\'s sketchbooks. Meowth asks again why Brock came back, though he doesn\'t give an answer. The last Ball sucked in is the GS Ball, but then, a rip in the tent appears, caused by a {{pkmn|Trainer}}\'s {{p|Nidoqueen}}. Team Rocket\'s tent and Jigglypuff are sent flying into the distance. The [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|Meowth Balloon]] falls to the ground, releasing every Poké Ball inside. The Trainer turns out to be {{Gary}}, and his Nidoqueen attacks Lickitung by grabbing its tongue and swinging it into Team Rocket. Nidoqueen then sends Victreebel flying into Team Rocket with a {{m|Mega Punch}}. Jessie throws Meowth into the {{pkmn|battle}}; he tries using {{m|Scratch}}, but his claws break from Nidoqueen\'s armored body. Gary tells his Nidoqueen to use {{m|Strength}}, hurling Team Rocket into the air and sending them blasting off again.\n\nGary has Nidoqueen use its horn to free everyone. He then greets his grandfather, and everyone except for Ash admires his well-trained Nidoqueen. Ash tries to brag about his [[Orange League]] Winner\'s Trophy; Gary congratulates him but notes that it didn\'t help him defeat Team Rocket. Soon enough, Ash and Gary prepare for a battle to prove who has become the better Trainer over the past months.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

However, this contradicts \'\'[[M02|The Power of One]]\'\', where Professor Oak, Delia, and [[Professor Ivy]] travel to [[Shamouti Island]] and meet up with {{Ash}}, {{an|Misty}}, and Tracey himself at the end of the movie. This also contradicts \'\'[[EP084|The Lost Lapras]]\'\', since Tracey saw Oak on the phone monitor, even going as far as to introduce himself as "Tracey Sketchit". He also had a full conversation with him about {{TP|Tracey|Scyther}} in \'\'[[EP097|Tracey Gets Bugged]]\'\', although in those cases, it could be dismissed since he didn\'t meet him in person.\n* When Ash sends out his {{AP|Tauros}}, it is sent out from a {{i|Poké Ball|regular Poké Ball}}, instead of the [[Safari Ball]] it was captured in.\n* In one scene, Delia calls Tracey "Miss Tracey", even though Tracey is male.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[Pikachu\'s Jukebox]]: [[My Best Friends]]\n* In the scene where Delia is accidentally trampling {{an|Brock}}, she does not recognize him until he looks up. In the original version, she recognizes Brock before he looks up.\n* When [[James]] orders his {{TP|James|Victreebel}} to attack [[Ash\'s Muk]], in the dub, he told it to "get stuck on Muk". In the original version, he commands it to use {{m|Double-Edge}}.\n* In the dub, James orders Victreebel to use {{m|Poison Powder}} while attacking Muk, but in the original version, he didn\'t give an attack order.\n* In the dub, Ash commands Muk to use {{m|Poison Gas}} on Victreebel. In the original Japanese version, Ash simply calls Muk by its name.\n* The English-dubbed version of this episode was released in Japan as part of the {{DL|Pokémon de English|Pokémon de English! Kazu - Iro Hen}} VHS/DVD. This version has a few changes made:\n** The [[Who\'s That Pokémon?]] segment is presented in the Johto League Champions style rather than the original style as the segment from [[EP158]] is used.\n** The ending credits are not included.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FFDDAA|bordercolor=FFBB55\n|bg={{tt|Забавление в цирка|Entertainment in the Circus}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|真新鎮，我回來了|Pallet Town, I have returned}}\n|cs={{tt|Stanový útok|A tent attack}}\n|nl={{tt|Een Gespannen Situatie|A Tent Situation}}\n|de={{tt|Zirkus in Alabastia|Circus in Pallet Town}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Le plus lamentable chapiteau du monde|The most pitiful circus tent in the world}}\n|he=יריבות מבית {{tt|\'\'Yerivut me\'bayit\'\'|Home Rivalry}}\n|hu={{tt|Cirkusz|Circus}}\n|it={{tt|Ritorno a casa|Return at home}}{{tt|*|Original 2000 dub}} <br> {{tt|Ritorno a Biancavilla|Coming back to Pallet Town}}{{tt|*|2014 K2 TV dub}}\n|pt_br={{tt|O Circo Está Armado|The Circus is Mounted}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Uma Situação de Tenda|A Tent Situation}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Reencuentros!|Meeting again!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Metidos en una carpa|Inside a tent}}\n|pl={{tt|Tajemnica Brocka|Brock\'s secret}}\n|ro={{tt|O Situație despre Corturi|A Situation about Tents}}\n|hi=टेंशन वाली सिचुएशन {{tt|\'\'Tension wali Situation\'\'|Situation of Tension}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}} \n}}\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP114 |\nprevtitle=The Underground Round Up |\nnextcode=EP116 |\nnexttitle=The Rivalry Revival |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Orange}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0115}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|115]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Yukiyoshi Ōhashi]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Kazu Yokota]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Shigeru Ōmachi]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Yūsaku Takeda]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Ash]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Brock]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Delia]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Tracey]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Professor Oak]]\n\n[[de:Zirkus in Alabastia]]\n[[es:EP117]]\n[[fr:EP115]]\n[[it:EP115]]\n[[ja:無印編第115話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第116集]]'}
