Brave Bird VS {{tt|God Bird|Sky Attack}}!!\'\') is the 133rd episode of the {{series|Sun & Moon}}, and the 1,072nd episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on August 4, 2019 and is scheduled to air in the United States on December 7, 2019.\n{{spoilers}}\n<!--\n==Blurb==\nOfficial Blurb from Pokémon.com goes here, with source link-->\n<!--Please do not alter the blurb to fix any errors, they are meant to be presented as they are on the official site.-->\n\n==Plot==\nAfter [[Nanu]] takes {{AP|Rowlet}}\'s cloak away from the battlefield, {{Ash}} orders Rowlet to fly over {{p|Decidueye}}. Decidueye speeds past before approaching with a {{m|Leaf Blade}}, which Rowlet narrowly evades. Hau orders Decidueye to follow up with {{m|Razor Leaf}}, but Rowlet soars through the oncoming leaves and stops behind Decidueye. Rowlet uses {{m|Seed Bomb}}, but Decidueye again counters the attack with Leaf Blade. The pair exchanges Razor Leaf attacks, but they cancel each other out. As Ash orders Rowlet to fly to the right, {{an|Kiawe}} declares Ash is setting up for a single knockout with {{m|Brave Bird}}, and {{an|Lana}} expresses her concern about potential recoil damage.\n\nAs Rowlet approaches, Decidueye kicks it aside several times, effectively blocking any attempt to attack. Rowlet manages to evade two barrages of Razor Leaves, but is knocked onto the field by a direct Leaf Blade. Hau then has Decidueye strike Rowlet with {{m|Spirit Shackle}}, immobilizing its opponent. Afterwards, Decidueye uses Leaf Blade and slams Rowlet directly into the wall. Rowlet, however, is still able to fight despite feeling dizzy after having finally mastered {{m|Feather Dance}}, a tactic that limits the amount of damage done. Decidueye uses Razor Leaf, but Rowlet flies up and prepares to use Brave Bird. Decidueye uses {{m|Sky Attack}} and subsequently collides with Rowlet. When the dust clears, both sides appear motionless on the battlefield. While Decidueye stands up moments after, Rowlet is still on the ground. Since Rowlet isn\'t moving, Nanu declares Hau the winner, but suddenly, [[Hala]] reveals his objection to Nanu\'s verdict, revealing it has actually not fainted. At that moment, Rowlet rolls over, revealing itself to be merely asleep.\n\nAsh is unimpressed and orders Rowlet to wake up so they can finish the match. Rowlet wakes up, to which Hau admits that Rowlet is always catching him off guard. Hau declares that he and Decidueye came to defeat him. Ash thanks Hau, while Nanu apologizes to Ash for the bad judgement, before giving the signal for the battle to resume. Rowlet flies up and uses Razor Leaf, to which Decidueye counters with the same move. After the moves collide, Rowlet uses Seed Bomb, which gets reflected by Leaf Blade. As Rowlet tries to pick up its [[Everstone]], Decidueye uses Spirit Shackle to bind Rowlet to the field. Decidueye follows up with a Sky Attack, while Ash and [[Toucannon\'s flock]] flap their arms and wings to prompt Rowlet to use Feather Dance. Rowlet follows through and Decidueye\'s attack instead strikes the feathers, while Rowlet is unharmed. Hau realizes Rowlet is in the air above, but Decidueye is fainted by Rowlet\'s direct Brave Bird attack. Nanu checks on Decidueye before announcing that Ash and Rowlet have won the round. Ash\'s supporters and other Pokémon cheer him on while {{AP|Meltan}} wanders off to a rooftop and begins spinning its hex nut to signal to {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Meltan|its friends}}. Afterwards Hau congratulates Ash and Rowlet on the victory. Ash replies that Decidueye was a strong opponent. Hau admits his defeat, and requests a battle with Ash someday, and the pair shake hands on it. As Hau makes his way backstage, Hala approaches his grandson and commends him on his efforts. Hau bursts into tears and accepts a hug from his grandfather.\n\n{{TRT}} reopen their food van for the influx of orders, and they are soon swamped with hungry customers. Meanwhile at [[Bewear\'s den]], {{an|Bewear}} and {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Stufful}} exit their hot spring. The pair are greeted by a mecha {{p|Oranguru}}, who hands them a fruit drink to enjoy. After a quick sip, Bewear and Stufful return to relaxing in the water.\n\nBackstage at the [[Manalo Stadium]], Kiawe removes the saddle from {{TP|Kiawe|Charizard}}, while {{an|Sophocles}} calls for his attention. Sophocles admits he believed there was no way to defeat Kiawe being the first to get a [[Z-Ring]] and [[Kiawe\'s grandfather]] being an [[Island Kahuna]]. However, through battles, Sophocles admits he has begun to enjoy battling. In a swell of confidence, Sophocles swears he won\'t lose, and Kiawe supports his determination. The conversation is interrupted as an announcement calls the pair to the battlefield. As [[Caster]] introduces the two boys as fellow [[Pokémon School]] students and rivals, Ash rushes to join the girls in the sidelines to watch the clash between Kiawe and Sophocles begin. As Ash\'s Pokémon take the opportunity to greet their Trainer, Ash realizes Meltan is missing. {{Rotom}} points at the tower, where Meltan is spinning its nut, ever since Ash\'s battle has ended.\n\nHala starts the battle between Kiawe and Charizard against Sophocles and his {{TP|Sophocles|Vikavolt}}. Charizard uses {{m|Flamethrower}}, to which Vikavolt dodges. Charizard flies in for a {{m|Fire Punch}}, though Sophocles has Vikavolt speed by and follow up with a barrage of {{m|String Shot}}s. Charizard, however, dodges all of the sticky thread. Sophocles realizes his timing must have been off, but nonetheless he urges his Vikavolt to continue on. Charizard tries another Fire Punch, but it is forced to twist around to evade Vikavolt\'s oncoming {{m|Signal Beam}}. Kiawe has Charizard fly upwards and prepare to launch an {{m|Aerial Ace}}. Much to Kiawe\'s surprise, Vikavolt switches to {{m|Zap Cannon}} and lands a direct hit on Charizard. Sophocles sees an opening and wields his Z-Ring, having Vikavolt entangle Charizard in sticky threads for a deadly {{m|Savage Spin-Out}} attack.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
