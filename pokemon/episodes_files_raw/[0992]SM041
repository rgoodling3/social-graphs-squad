It first aired in Japan on September 7, 2017 and in the United States on November 25, 2017 as part of a marathon including \'\'[[SM042|Alola, Kanto!]]\'\' and \'\'[[M20|I Choose You!]]\'\'.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/20_41-mounting-an-electrifying-charge/-->\n<i>Sophocles has wanted to enter a Charjabug race for a long time, and now with Ash and Kiawe on his team, he finally can! The huge event features tough competitors, including the arrogant Red Comet team and a disguised Team Rocket.\n\nRed Comet is favored to win, and it starts out strong! But when it’s time to confront a giant sheet of ice, everyone has problems—except for a quick-thinking Sophocles, who uses his Charjabug’s String Shot move to maintain traction. As Red Comet looks on in horror, the Sophocles Lab team reaches the finish line and becomes the happy winner!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{an|Kiawe}}, {{Ash}}, and {{an|Sophocles}} are watching an advertisement showing {{p|Charjabug}} racers. Sophocles explains what they do and reveals that he is joining an annual race they set up, but he requires a team of three to enter. Ash and Kiawe promptly agree to enter the race with him. After school, Sophocles shows them a kit for the race and they decide who gets which jobs. Once they have decided, Sophocles places his {{TP|Sophocles|Charjabug}} into the Charjabug racer and they go for a test run, but Charjabug isn\'t able to go fast. Kiawe suggests they do some training, allowing them to bond as a team. They do so as Sophocles continues to make changes to the car, and soon, their times improve.\n\nThe day of the race arrives and many teams are taking part in the race but they soon make rivals with the Red Comet team led by [[Horacio]] and their {{Shiny}} Charjabug. Both teams vow to win as {{TRT}} enter as well with {{MTR}} inside a fake Charjabug racer. The teams gather in the stadium where {{al|Anna}} provides the commentary and explains the rules and introduces the Pokémon who\'ll be creating obstacles for the teams. The terrains are brought out as Anna explains that a pit stop is available between each terrain as everyone takes their positions. The race begins and everyone heads out but a crash on the first corner knows out a few players which Ash manages to avoid and enter the first terrain where {{p|Boldore}} who causes disruption by making cliffs appear.\n\nWith a bit of cheating, Team Rocket are able to pass through the terrain and take the lead as Ash and several other teams come to a stop at the cliff. Sophocles comes up with a suggestion for getting over it which Ash does as other teams follow their lead. Team Rocket and Red Comet reach the first pit stop and change their tires for the next terrain as Ash arrives at the pit stop and Kiawe quickly changes the tires. After a quick refill of [[Moomoo Milk]], Kiawe provides them with [[Safety Goggles]] and they set of over the desert terrain. Meowth launches an attack on Red Comet only for it to give them a speed increase but as Meowth makes another attempt, he ends up being ejected, resulting in them being disqualified. The terrain has left Red Comet\'s Charjabug tired but they soon exit followed by Ash and [[Team Electric Princess]].\n\nOutside, Team Rocket are refusing to leave only for {{an|Bewear}} to come in and take them away. The race continues through city terrain but {{p|Castform}} changes rain to hail, making the track slippery. Team Electric Princess lose control and are about to crash into Sophocles\' Charjabug but Ash dives between them and gets knocked out. Sophocles and Kiawe rush to Ash\'s aid as Red Comet aren\'t getting enough traction on the ice. The Electric Princess Team apologize for what happened as Sophocles joins Kiawe and Ash and decides to replace Ash as the runner. The Red Comet team isn\'t going anywhere as Sophocles and Charjabug race past them, having used String Shot on the tires and shoes to get traction. \n\nSophocles and Charjabug soon cross the line and are declared the winners. Anna interviews them about the victory and then presents them with their shared prize.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
