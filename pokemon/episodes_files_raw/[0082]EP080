Final Battle!\'\') is the 80th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]] and the final episode of the [[S01|Indigo League arc]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on January 21, 1999 and in the United States on November 27, 1999.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/02_26-friends-to-the-end/-->\n<i>It\'s the sixth round match at the Pokémon League Competition, and Ash, Misty and Brock are in the stands cheering for their new friend, Ritchie. When an unfortunate turn of events happens, Ash learns a valuable lesson that he will take with him on the rest of his journey as a Pokémon trainer. Finally, Ash and Ritchie get to march with the athletes for the closing ceremonies of the Competition where they add a Pokémon League Badge to their cherished collection.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} is still upset that he lost his last match and is curled up in bed, which concerns {{ashfr}}, {{Delia}}, and {{an|Professor Oak}}. {{an|Misty}} comments that he should be happy that he made it as far as he did and enters the bedroom to try to cheer him up. She offers to get him something to eat and then suggests he take a walk, but he refuses. The pair begins to argue about how good a {{pkmn|Trainer}} Ash really is, and Professor Oak eventually agrees with Misty, saying that had Ash trained {{AP|Charizard}} better, he could have gone further. When Ash and Misty resume arguing, {{AP|Pikachu}} {{m|Thunder Shock}}s everyone in the room in outrage.\n\nLater, [[Ritchie]]\'s next {{pkmn|battle}} commences; both Trainers are equally matched and are eventually down to their last Pokémon. Ritchie\'s opponent, [[Assunta]], sends out {{p|Ivysaur}} and Ritchie calls on [[Sparky]]. As soon as he pops out, Sparky is beaten by Ivysaur, and none of his Thunder Shocks are effective. Ivysaur eventually jumps into the air and unleashes a {{m|Solar Beam}}, hurling Sparky to the ground. Just as he gets up, he is hit and defeated by Ivysaur\'s {{m|Tackle}}, giving Assunta the victory. Later, Ash joins Ritchie near a lake. As their Pikachu play, they talk about their losses. Ritchie says that he would have trained harder if he had known how tough the competition would be. He then comments on how losing is good for Trainers, and Ash realizes how immature he was. He and Ritchie then promise to become Pokémon Masters no matter what.\n\nSuddenly, both Pikachu fall into a hole, as do Ritchie and Ash. {{TRT}} appears at the surface, uses a cage at the end of a fishing pole, and pulls both Pikachu out of their hole. They try to shock them, but [[James]] tells them that the bars absorb electricity. They start to make their getaway when Ash and Ritchie rise out of the other hole, clinging to their {{AP|Pidgeotto}} and {{p|Butterfree}}, respectively. Ash sends out {{AP|Bulbasaur}}, who tries to grab the cage with his {{m|Vine Whip}}. James sends out {{TP|James|Weezing}} for a {{m|Smog}} attack. Pidgeotto blows the gas back at Team Rocket with {{m|Gust}} as Ritchie sends out [[Zippo]]. After Bulbasaur frees Pikachu and Sparky with a {{m|Razor Leaf}}, Zippo ignites Weezing\'s gas with a {{m|Flamethrower}}. As Team Rocket run around in pain, Ash has Pikachu and Sparky recharge the cage; he then sends out {{AP|Squirtle}}, who extinguishes Team Rocket with {{m|Water Gun}}. Team Rocket is sent blasting off again after Pikachu and Sparky toss the electrically-charged cage at the trio.\n\nLater that night, the closing ceremonies begin and the [[Indigo League]] competitors march with their main Pokémon into the stadium, waving to the eager crowd. [[Charles Goodshow|Mr. Goodshow]] gives each and every one of them a special [[Badge|Pokémon League Badge]] for competing in the league. The top three Trainers, two males and one female, wave from the stage amid the cheers of the crowd. The commentator then asks the audience to focus on the night skies. As the stadium lights dim, the closing ceremony fireworks display begins. Meanwhile, Team Rocket is digging a tunnel from outside the Indigo Stadium with the hope of stealing the competitors\' Pokémon. {{MTR}} listens to the ground above and tells [[Jessie]] and James to dig up. Unfortunately for them, a huge bomb falls through. It goes off and Team Rocket is blasted off again.\n\nThe next morning, Ash reminds him of their promise, before Ritchie sets off. After Ash remembers the highlights of the League games, he sees his friends, mother, and Professor Oak. Smiling, he asks Pikachu if he is ready to go back to [[Pallet Town]]. After Pikachu affirms it, he runs over to them.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

While the rest of the Pokémon are standing with their {{pkmn|Trainer}}s, {{AP|Pikachu}} and [[Sparky]] are reversed.\n* The {{p|Tentacool}} seen during [[Ritchie]] and [[Assunta]]\'s match used {{m|Bubble}}, even though Tentacool was [[Anime move errors|unable to learn Bubble]] until [[Generation V]].\n* When Ritchie turns to Ash at the lake, the stripes on Sparky\'s back are missing.\n* When Team Rocket captures the two {{p|Pikachu}}, the bars on the cage are the same color as the Pikachu\'s bodies.\n\n<gallery>\nEP080 Error.png|Sparky\'s missing back stripes\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[Pikachu\'s Jukebox]]: [[Together Forever]]\n* In the original version, Ritchie apologizes for losing despite how much his friends were cheering him on. In the dub, he points out that he and Ash have one more thing in common by both losing.\n* Ritchie blames his loss on his own inexperience in the original while in the dub he places the blame on how tough his competition was.\n* The commemorative plates given out to participants is referred to as a "Pokémon League Badge" in the dub. Ash also references them earlier in the dub while in the original he says that he\'s starving for dinner.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=AAFFAA|bordercolor=FFAAAA\n|zh_cmn={{tt|神奇寶貝聯盟最後的戰鬥|Final Battle of the Pokémon League}}\n|cs={{tt|Přátelé navěky|Friends forever}}\n|da={{tt|Venner For Altid|Friends For Ever}}\n|nl={{tt|Vrienden voor het Leven|Friends for Life}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Amis malgré tout|Friends despite everything}}\n|de={{tt|Das Versprechen!|The promise!}}\n|he=חברים עד הסוף {{tt|\'\'Khaverim ad ha\'sof\'\'|Friends to the end}}\n|hi=ये दोस्ती हम नही तोदेंगे! {{tt|\'\'Ye dosti hum nahi todenge!\'\'|We wiil not break this Friendship!}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n|hu={{tt|A barát bajban is barát|A Friend in Need is a Friend Indeed}}\n|it={{tt|Amici per sempre|Friends forever}}\n|ko={{tt|포켓몬 리그 최후의 승자|Pokémon League Final winner}}\n|no={{tt|Venner for alltid|Friends forever}}\n|pl={{tt|Przyjaciele na zawsze|Friends forever}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Amigos até o Fim|Friends to the End}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Amigos até ao Fim|Friends to the End}}\n|ro={{tt|Prieteni Până La Sfârșit|Friends To The End}}\n|ru={{tt|Дружба на всю жизнь|Friendship for all life}}\n|sr={{tt|Пријатељи заувек|Friends Forever}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Amigos hasta el fin!|Friends to the end!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Amigos hasta el final|Friends to the end!}}\n|sv={{tt|Vänner för livet|Friends for life}}\n}}\n{{-}}\n\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP079 |\nprevtitle=Friend and Foe Alike |\nnextcode=EP081 |\nnexttitle=Pallet Party Panic |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Kanto| }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0080}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|080]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Shinzō Fujita]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Shigeru Ōmachi]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Yūsaku Takeda]]\n[[Category:Pokémon League episodes]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Ash]]\n\n[[de:Das Versprechen]]\n[[es:EP082]]\n[[fr:EP080]]\n[[it:EP080]]\n[[ja:無印編第80話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第81集]]'}
