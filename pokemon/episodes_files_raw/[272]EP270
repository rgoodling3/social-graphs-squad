It first aired in Japan on October 17, 2002 and in the United States on September 27, 2003. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/06_08-cant-beat-the-heat/-->\n<i>Our hero is in the middle of the first match of the championship tournament at the Johto League Silver Conference. His opponent is his long time rival—Gary Oak. Each trainer is down one Pokémon, with five to go. Gary\'s Blastoise is very strong and knocks out Ash\'s Heracross. Ash isn\'t surprised—that Blastoise was the Squirtle that Gary got when he first started out as a trainer! Gary recalls Blastoise and the battle continues. Finally, each trainer is down to their last Pokémon. Gary has saved Blastoise till the end—and Ash calls out Charizard! Blastoise has the advantage because it\'s a Water Type, but Ash is very clever. He uses Charizard\'s Flame Thrower attack to scorch the battle field, trapping Blastoise. Blastoise uses Hydro Pump to cool off the field, but it backfires. The field becomes all steamy and no one can see. Charizard finishes off the battle with a Seismic Toss. Ash is thrilled to have finally defeated his rival—but does he have what it takes to continue? His next opponent will be Harrison from Hoenn.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{Gary}} continue their six-on-six match on the rock field. [[Gary\'s Blastoise]] uses {{m|Hydro Pump}} to counter {{AP|Heracross}}\' {{m|Fury Attack}}. However, despite a last-minute evasion tactic behind a rock, Hydro Pump manages to blast through the boulder and knocks Heracross out, forcing Ash to send out {{AP|Muk}}. Blastoise uses {{m|Skull Bash}}, but Muk isn\'t fazed by the attack. Muk uses {{m|Sludge Bomb}}, but Blastoise counters with {{m|Rapid Spin}} to deflect the shot. Continuing to spin, it tries to hit Muk, but Muk easily catches and smothers its opponent. Blastoise escapes by using Hydro Pump, and Ash recalls Muk in favor of {{AP|Bayleef}}, hoping that a {{type|Grass}} will provide a good advantage over Blastoise. Bayleef evades the first Hydro Pump with a {{m|Vine Whip}}-powered jump, but her airborne {{m|Razor Leaf}} is deflected by Rapid Spin. Then, Bayleef tries to use {{m|Body Slam}}, but Blastoise uses {{m|Bite}} on her. She gets tossed by her leaf and is knocked out.\n\nSince Ash has lost three Pokémon, the referee calls for a five-minute intermission. During the break, {{AP|Pikachu}} wants to battle Blastoise, but Ash explains he can only use the six entrants that he arranged before the match. In the stands, {{Delia}} and {{an|Professor Oak}} reminisce about the match bringing back memories from the boys\' childhood growing up together.\n\nWhen the break ends, Ash sends out {{AP|Snorlax}}, while Gary sends out {{TP|Gary|Arcanine}}; {{an|Brock}} believes that he will save Blastoise for last. Arcanine uses {{m|Take Down}} to charge straight at Snorlax, who responds with {{m|Body Slam}}. Arcanine evades the attack and traps Snorlax with {{m|Fire Spin}}. However, Snorlax frees itself and lands a direct hit with {{m|Hyper Beam}}. Arcanine struggles to get up, but it faints, and Gary sends {{p|Nidoqueen}} back out. Ash warns Snorlax to be careful since Nidoqueen also knows Hyper Beam. Using its tail to jump, a tactic copied from Bayleef, Nidoqueen manages to land on Snorlax and strike it with {{m|Double Kick}}. Nidoqueen then blasts a Hyper Beam, but Snorlax ducks and retaliates with {{m|Ice Punch}}, defeating Nidoqueen and tying the match.\n\nGary sends a {{p|Scizor}} out, and after a series of {{m|Quick Attack}}s, Scizor defeats Snorlax with {{m|Metal Claw}}. Noticing Scizor\'s speed, Brock notes that Ash had selected his entries based on power, and his two remaining Pokémon will subsequently have trouble against Scizor. Sending Muk back out, Muk easily absorbs Scizor\'s Quick Attack, allowing it to attack with Sludge Bomb, which Scizor evades. Scizor uses Metal Claw again, and while Muk absorbs the attack, it allows Scizor to lift and throw Muk into the air, then use {{m|Swift}} to defeat it.\n\nNow down to one Pokémon against Gary\'s three, Ash sends out {{AP|Charizard}}, something Gary reveals he anticipated. Scizor lunges towards Charizard with {{m|Steel Wing}}, but Charizard dodges and attacks with {{m|Flamethrower}}. Scizor jumps to avoid the attack, but Charizard flies up and knocks it out by a super-effective Flamethrower to the face. Gary, undaunted, sends out {{p|Golem}} next. Brock and {{an|Misty}} note that Charizard will have a hard time against Golem because of its double weakness to {{type|Rock}}s. Golem first uses {{m|Magnitude}}, which momentarily stuns Charizard. Charizard attempts to use {{m|Seismic Toss}}, but Golem proves to be too heavy for it. Golem lands back on its feet and uses {{m|Rollout}}. However, Ash orders Charizard to use {{m|Dragon Rage}}, which hits Golem and knocks it out.\n\nWith both Ash and Gary down to one Pokémon, Gary sends out Blastoise. Charizard uses Flamethrower, but it is deflected by Rapid Spin. Blastoise uses Hydro Pump next and hits Charizard\'s face. Charizard flies into the air, but its airborne attack is repelled by Skull Bash. As Charizard continues flying through the air and dodging Hydro Pumps, Brock notes that {{t|Fire}} attacks sometimes work against {{type|Water}}s, but Charizard will need to use a close-range attack for that to happen.\n\nAsh desperately looks for some way to take advantage, and he suddenly notices that - although Charizard\'s attacks have missed Blastoise - the fire that has hit the rocks have been left red hot and somewhat melted. He commands Charizard to burn the field instead of attacking Blastoise. Although he knows that Ash\'s specialty is thinking outside-the-box, Gary is still nevertheless puzzled by Ash\'s tactic. Blastoise is immobilized by the red-hot field, something that not even a type advantage could cover. Resorting to cool the field using Hydro Pump, Blastoise only succeeds in covering the field in steam. When the steam clears, Blastoise and Charizard are locked in close-range combat - too close for Blastoise to aim its Hydro Pumps. Though Blastoise manages to duck from a Dragon Rage, it allows Charizard to attempt a Seismic Toss. Blastoise tries to escape by biting Charizard\'s arm, but to no avail. The attack continues and once Charizard and Blastoise land on the ground, everyone begins to wonder who won. When the dust clears, Blastoise is able to get up, as both Pokémon have a stare off. Blastoise soon succumbs to the damage it took and faints. Ash, realizing that he just beat his long-time rival Gary, stands in awe, then jumps for joy and thanks Charizard for a spectacular battle.\n\nMeanwhile, {{TRT}} has ended yet another day with a big profit. However, [[Jessie]] is preventing {{OBP|Delibird|Team Rocket}} from making off with their hard-earned gains. However, {{MTR}} also notes that with the profits, they have nearly wiped out all their outstanding Team Rocket debts. Jessie is first to plan on franchising their souvenir stand, which [[James]] and Meowth support.\n\nLater that night, Ash meets Gary privately by the lake. Gary gives Ash his half of the {{i|Poké Ball}}. Reflecting on the battle, Gary isn\'t ashamed that he had lost the battle. He declares that when he tied in the fishing contest, he had felt like a failure, hence taking it as a "loss", but he declares that Ash won fair and square today. The two shake hands, and Gary promises to cheer for Ash is his next match.\n\nThe next morning, Ash begins his second [[Full Battle]] on a grass field against his new friend Harrison, with Ash having the first move. Leading off with Pikachu, Harrison responds with a new Pokémon, {{p|Kecleon}}. The two opponents pause for a moment as another intense six-on-six match is about to start.\n\n==Major events==\n* [[Ash\'s Muk]] is revealed to know {{m|Sludge Bomb}}.\n* {{Gary}} is revealed to have obtained a {{p|Scizor}} and a {{p|Golem}}.\n* Ash defeats Gary, marking his first victory over his [[rival]] and advancing him to the quarterfinals.\n* Ash and Gary end their rivalry and become friends again, just as they were when they were little. \n* {{TRT}} plans to pay off their debts towards {{OBP|Delibird|Team Rocket}}.\n* Ash begins his [[Full Battle]] against {{jo|Harrison}} in the quarterfinals.\n* Harrison is revealed to own a {{p|Kecleon}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n[[File:PMTV EP270.png|thumb|200px|right|{{tt|Pocket Monster TV|Who\'s That Pokémon}}]]\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{Gary}}\n* {{an|Professor Oak}}\n* {{Delia}}\n* {{jo|Harrison}}\n* [[Vincent|Jackson]]\n* [[Macy]]\n* [[Charles Goodshow]]\n* [[Gary\'s cheerleaders]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP EP270.png|thumb|200px|right|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Bayleef}} \'\'(U.S. and international)\'\', {{p|Blastoise}} \'\'(Japan)\'\'\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Togepi}} ({{OP|Misty|Togepi}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Charizard}} ({{OP|Ash|Charizard}})\n* {{p|Muk}} ({{OP|Ash|Muk}})\n* {{p|Snorlax}} ({{OP|Ash|Snorlax}})\n* {{p|Heracross}} ({{OP|Ash|Heracross}})\n* {{p|Bayleef}} ({{OP|Ash|Bayleef}})\n* {{p|Psyduck}} ({{OP|Misty|Psyduck}})\n* {{p|Politoed}} ({{OP|Misty|Politoed}})\n* {{p|Blastoise}} ({{OP|Gary|Blastoise}})\n* {{p|Arcanine}} ({{OP|Gary|Arcanine}})\n* {{p|Nidoqueen}} ({{Gary}}\'s)\n* {{p|Scizor}} ({{Gary}}\'s)\n* {{p|Golem}} ({{Gary}}\'s)\n* {{p|Kecleon}} ({{jo|Harrison}}\'s)\n* {{p|Delibird}} ({{OBP|Delibird|Team Rocket|Team Rocket}})\n\n==Trivia==\n* An instrumental version of [[OK!]] is used in the background during the final {{pkmn|battle}}, even in the dub.\n* When {{AP|Charizard}} uses {{m|Seismic Toss}} on {{TP|Gary|Blastoise}}, the globe appears as usual, but, whereas normally specific shapes on the globe cannot be made out, {{wp|Asia}} and {{wp|Australia}} are [[Pokémon world in relation to the real world|prominently seen]].\n* This episode is featured on \'\'Volume 5: Blastoise\'\' from [[Viz Media]]\'s {{OBP|Pokémon All-Stars|Region 1}} series.\n* This is the only time that the move {{m|Magnitude}} is used in the {{pkmn|anime}}. Due to {{wp|2004 Chūetsu earthquake|an incident}} with [[AG101 (unaired)|a banned \'\'Advanced Generation\'\' series episode]] featuring the move {{m|Earthquake}}, Magnitude would never be used again in the anime due to its extreme similarity to Earthquake.\n* Parts of this episode were reanimated and used for flashback material for \'\'[[BW116|The Fires of a Red-Hot Reunion!]]\'\'.\n* When Charizard and Blastoise fight in hand-to-hand combat, Gary says Charizard is too close for Blastoise to aim "with its hydro cannons", referring to the cannons on its back with which it shoots its Hydro Pump attack. Coincidentally, [[Generation III]] would later introduce the attack {{m|Hydro Cannon}}.\n* Gary has Scizor dodge Muk\'s {{m|Sludge Bomb}}, even though a {{type|Poison}} move would have no effect on Scizor, a {{type|Steel}} Pokémon.\n* Team Rocket doesn\'t recite the motto or blast off in this episode.\n* Although [[Who\'s That Pokémon]] was random by this point in the dub, the Pokémon featured was {{p|Bayleef}} which did play a significant role in this episode.\n* This marks the only known instance of Ash not using {{AP|Pikachu}} in a [[Full Battle]].\n\n===Errors===\n* After Gary sends out Arcanine, Snorlax\'s feet are the same color as its body.\n* After Gary sends out Nidoqueen, part of Snorlax\'s blue color goes into is chest area.\n* When Nidoqueen uses her tail to jump, her lower jaw is colored with the same blue as her skin. The same coloring error is made just before she launches her {{m|Hyper Beam}}.\n* {{an|Professor Oak}} says that {{p|Golem}} is the second heaviest Pokémon, and only Snorlax is heavier. This was true in [[Generation I]]; however, {{p|Steelix}}, introduced in [[Generation II]], is also heavier than Golem.\n* When Golem used Magnitude, it should not have affected Charizard as {{p|Charizard}} is a {{type|Flying}} Pokémon and Magnitude is a {{type|Ground}} move. However, this may have been due to the fact that Charizard was standing on the ground at the time.\n* During the climactic battle between [[Ash\'s Charizard]] and [[Gary\'s Blastoise]], Blastoise\'s lower jaw is incorrectly colored blue instead of cream.\n** This also happens in the intro from the previous episode.\n* In the dub the announcer announces Harrison as being from {{jo|Silver Town}}, when he was introduced as being from [[Littleroot Town]] in \'\'[[EP265|Pop Goes The Sneasel]]\'\'.\n* When Gary\'s Blastoise uses [[Rapid Spin (move)|Rapid Spin]] to counter [[Sludge Bomb (move)|Sludge Bomb]] by Ash\'s Muk, the commentator says "Blastoise uses Rapid Spin to send Sludge Bomb back where it came from", although Blastoise sends it to some other direction rather than at Muk.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:EP270 error 3.png|Blastoise\'s miscolored jaw\nFile:EP270 error.png|Snorlax\'s blue portion going into the chest area\nFile:EP270 error 2.png|Nidoqueen\'s blue jaw\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|zh_cmn={{tt|勁敵對決！！水箭龜對抗噴火龍！！|Rival Showdown!!
