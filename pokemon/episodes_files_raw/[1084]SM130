It first aired in Japan on July 14, 2019 and in the United States on November 16, 2019.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/22_38-battling-besties/-->\n<i>Now that the Alola Pokémon League’s qualifying round is over, it’s time for the real matches to begin! Ash faces off against the scheming Faba, and crowd favorite Ilima takes on Team Skull’s Boss, the foul-tempered Guzma. But perhaps the most exciting match of the day occurs when Lana and Primarina battle against Mallow and Tsareena. The two may be best friends outside the arena, but that won’t stop them from giving their all during this battle!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAs the first round of the [[Manalo Conference]] is about to begin, {{Ash}} and {{an|Faba}} are the first pair of {{pkmn|Trainer}}s to face each other. [[Caster]] mentions how Ash has cleared all four [[island challenge|grand trials]], while Faba is one of [[Aether Paradise]]\'s elite and a {{type|Psychic}} [[type expert|user]]. [[Hala]], [[battle judge|refereeing]] the match, asks both Trainers to send out their Pokémon, and Faba sends out his {{p|Hypno}}, while Ash chooses {{AP|Pikachu}}. However, before Pikachu can leap down from Ash\'s shoulder, Faba secretly has Hypno use {{m|Psychic}} to pick one of the {{i|Poké Ball}}s on Ash\'s belt and drop it on the field, causing {{AP|Meltan}} to come out, much to Ash\'s surprise. However, upon seeing that Meltan likes the crowd\'s attention and wants to battle, he decides to use it instead of Pikachu.\n[[File:SM130 Ash VS Faba.png|thumb|left|250px|Ash facing Faba]]\nAs Caster informs the crowd that Meltan is a newly discovered {{OBP|Pokémon|species|species}} of Pokémon, Faba remembers the previous night, when he secretly spied upon Ash\'s [[party|team]] to determine which Pokémon was the weakest. Settling on Meltan, he resolved to bring it out, wanting to make sure he would get to battle {{an|Professor Kukui|the Masked Royal}}. {{ashcl|Ash\'s classmates}}, thinking Ash chose Meltan on purpose, are wondering if he has a plan for it. Caster explains that the first round consists of one-on-one {{pkmn|battle|Single Battles}} before Hala officially starts the match. Meltan attacks with {{m|Flash Cannon}}, but Hypno avoids it. Meltan tries again with {{m|Headbutt}}, which is blocked by Hypno\'s {{m|Reflect}}. Unaware of Meltan noticing Hypno\'s pendulum, Faba has Hypno use {{m|Hypnosis}}. Ash tells Meltan not to look, but instead, it leaps forward and happily latches onto Hypno\'s pendulum. Hypno stops attacking and furiously tries to shake Meltan off, but by the time that happens, Meltan has already melted a part of the pendulum away, much to the shock of both Faba and Ash. Recovering from his own shock, Ash then has Meltan attack with Flash Cannon, which hits the dismayed Hypno head-on, defeating it and giving Ash the victory. Faba tries to protest, but Hala says Meltan simply made use of its natural abilities, making the move perfectly legal. Upon exiting the battlefield, Ash encounters [[Ilima]], who congratulates him on his victory before heading out for his own battle.\n\nThe second pair of Trainers, Ilima and [[Guzma]], enter the battlefield, with Ilima\'s fan-girls cheering for him. Caster points out that Ilima has competed in the [[Kalos League]], making him a favorite to win the tournament. He also introduces Guzma, who, while unknown compared to Ilima, managed to clear the preliminary round without taking a single hit. In the crowd, [[Tupp]] is annoyed at Ilima and leads his fellow {{tc|Team Skull Grunt}}s into a cheer for Guzma.\n[[File:SM130 Ilima VS Guzma.png|thumb|250px|Ilima facing Guzma]]\nIlima sends out a {{p|Kangaskhan}}, while Guzma sends out his {{p|Scizor}}. Hala tells both Trainers to battle fairly before starting the match. Kangaskhan begins the face-off with a {{m|Power-Up Punch}}, avoiding Scizor\'s {{m|Bullet Punch}} to deal the first hit. An orange glow surrounds Kangaskhan to signify her {{stat|Attack}} power rising, and {{Rotom}} points out that Power-Up Punch gets stronger with each hit. Kangaskhan uses Power-Up Punch again, but Guzma has Scizor avoid the attack with {{m|Agility}}. Ilima compliments Guzma\'s skills, but then reveals a [[Key Stone]], [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolving]] Kangaskhan into Mega Kangaskhan. With the child Kangaskhan now temporarily grown up thanks to Mega Evolution, the mother and child attack Scizor {{a|Parental Bond|together}} with Power-Up Punch, before following up with {{m|Rock Slide}}. Although Scizor dodges the mother\'s rocks with Agility and smacks the child\'s rocks aside, it is then struck by a simultaneous {{m|Low Kick}} from both of them.\n\nAs Ilima seems to have Guzma backed into a corner, he orders another Power-Up Punch, but Guzma orders Scizor to dodge backwards, avoiding the child\'s punch. As the mother prepares to attack, she suddenly hesitates, and Guzma takes the opportunity to have Scizor use {{m|X-Scissor}} on her. As the Kangaskhan pair attacks again, Scizor once again dodges to a specific direction, avoiding the child\'s attack and causing the mother to hesitate, leaving her open for another X-Scissor. {{an|Sophocles}} wonders why Scizor\'s attacks suddenly started hitting, and {{an|Kiawe}} explains that Scizor is now constantly seeking a position where it has both of its opponents in a straight line. With the child in the way, the mother will hesitate to attack in fear of hurting her offspring, giving Scizor a chance to attack her. With the tide of the battle turned, Kangaskhan is starting to get worn out, and Guzma orders one more X-Scissor to finish the job. Ilima tells Kangaskhan to dodge, but she\'s unable to out of exhaustion, and is struck down. As the child Kangaskhan reverts to its regular form and climbs back into its pouch, Hala declares Guzma the winner. In the stands, the Team Skull Grunts celebrate and Ilima\'s fan girls cry in disappointment, while Caster exclaims his surprise at the front runner getting defeated on the first round.\n\nThe third battle is between [[Hau]]\'s {{alo|Raichu}} and [[Samson Oak]]\'s Alolan {{p|Exeggutor}}. With its superior {{stat|Speed}}, Raichu is easily able to keep ahead of its opponent. Hau orders a {{m|Thunderbolt}}, but Exeggutor easily endures the attack. Samson has Exeggutor counterattack with {{m|Dragon Hammer}}, but Raichu dodges it with {{m|Quick Attack}}, before using {{m|Focus Blast}}, causing the tall Pokémon to topple down in defeat. In the stands, Hala looks proudly at his grandson as [[Olivia]] declares Hau the winner.\n[[File:SM130 Lana VS Mallow.png|thumb|left|250px|Lana facing Mallow]]\nAs {{an|Lana}} and {{an|Mallow}} walk towards the battlefield, Mallow expresses her nervousness, but Lana encourages her, telling her to treat it as any other match. Arriving at the battlefield, they take their positions and send out their Pokémon: {{TP|Lana|Primarina}} and {{TP|Mallow|Tsareena}}. From the stands, Ash and the rest of his classmates wish both of them luck. Olivia starts the battle, and Mallow makes the first move by ordering a {{m|Magical Leaf}}. Lana counters with {{m|Sparkling Aria}}, which not only stops Mallow\'s attack, but also attacks Tsareena at the same time. Unable to dodge the attack completely, Tsareena is hit, taking the first blow of the battle. {{an|Lillie}} says that Tsareena, who mostly specializes in close-range combat, isn\'t easily going to get close enough, but Rotom says that if she \'\'does\'\' get close enough, she will win.\n\nTsareena is forced to stay on the defensive as Lana continues her relentless assault. As another Sparkling Aria is fired, Mallow has Tsareena block it with {{m|Trop Kick}}, before charging in for a {{m|Stomp}}. However, Lana then surprises Mallow by having Primarina use {{m|Icy Wind}}, stopping Tsareena on her tracks. In the crowd, Mallow\'s classmates are also surprised to see that Lana has taught Primarina an {{t|Ice}} [[move]] in preparation of fighting against {{t|Grass}} types. Another Icy Wind blows Tsareena back, and she falls on her knees. Surprisingly, Mallow suddenly adones a peaceful look and compliments Lana, before taking out Tsareena\'s Poké Ball. However, when she tries to [[recall]] Tsareena, it doesn\'t work, and Tsareena forces herself back to her feet. Lana tells Mallow how she\'s always liked how considerate she is of others, but right now, Tsareena wants to keep fighting by her side. This makes Mallow remember the times she\'s shared with Tsareena, ever since she was a {{p|Bounsweet}} and a {{p|Steenee}}.\n\nHer resolve renewed, Mallow puts Tsareena\'s Poké Ball away and declares that she will keep fighting to win by her side. As the two Pokémon start exchanging attacks again, Mallow understands that Tsareena can\'t take another blow, which means they must finish the battle with their next attack to have any hopes of winning. She insecurely looks at her [[Z-Ring]], but looking at Tsareena, she is reassured. Tsareena walks up to her Trainer and the two embrace each other. Suddenly, Mallow\'s [[Grassium Z]] starts to glow, and Mallow feels the Z-Power flowing through her. She and Tsareena perform the {{m|Bloom Doom}} pose together, covering the whole battlefield in flowers. Lana is impressed, but refuses to lose, executing her own Z-Move, {{m|Oceanic Operetta}}, which she uses to block Mallow\'s Z-Move. For a few intense moments, the two Z-Moves clash, eventually cancelling each other out, causing the water from Lana\'s Z-Move to rain all over the battlefield. Lana orders an {{m|Aqua Jet}}, which Tsareena tries to counter with Trop Kick, but her exhaustion catches up to her, and she stumbles, resulting in the Aqua Jet hitting her dead on and causing her to [[fainting|faint]]. Moved to tears by the emotional battle, Olivia declares Lana the victor.\n\nWith the battle over, Lana walks up to Mallow, and the two compliment each other, sharing a grateful handshake. Waving for the cheering audience, Mallow expresses her happiness of having gone all out, as well as the frustration of losing. The rest of the group swears not to lose either, as the episode closes with the image of Mallow and Lana happily holding hands together.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
