It first aired in Japan on April 5, 2007 as part of a one-hour special with [[DP026]], and in the United States on September 8, 2007.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/10_27-settling-a-not-so-old-score/-->\n<i>The Floaroma Town Contest has just started, and Dawn\'s already in trouble! Pachirisu gets spooked before Dawn can even start their appeal, and only Dawn\'s quick thinking and a Poffin treat can calm it down so they can complete their performance. Even with that good recovery, it\'s no help for Dawn\'s nerves that the first round goes perfectly for Jessie, AKA Jessilina, and Dawn\'s old friend Kenny. Still, Dawn advances with them to the next round, much to her relief! She\'s eager to take on Kenny, but her first opponent turns out to be Jessie.\n\nJessie and Dustox battle Dawn and Piplup, and Jessie\'s not actually half-bad. She shows off a few good moves and manages to put Dawn on the defensive. But Dawn manages to come back and win the battle, which means she\'ll face Kenny and his Prinplup in the next round. Piplup\'s Peck isn\'t going to win the round this time, because Kenny\'s Prinplup easily counters that attack with Metal Claw. And with a Water-type battling a Water-type, it\'s going to take something special to win this one!\n\nDawn has Piplup use Whirlpool, and Prinplup boldly dives into the vortex to battle Piplup. It\'s a close battle, but in the end, victory goes to Dawn and Piplup, earning them the Floaroma Ribbon! Of course Kenny is disappointed, but he promises to battle Dawn again at another Contest. And with that, it\'s time to head for Eterna City and Ash\'s next Gym battle!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{an|Dawn}}\'s {{TP|Dawn|Pachirisu}} continues to suffer {{wp|stage fright}}, running wildly around the stage. Dawn pulls a [[Poffin]] out and tosses it into the air, the scent getting Pachirisu\'s attention. The {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} jumps with an electrified {{m|Spark}} and catches it, saving her performance. After eating the Poffin, Pachirisu uses {{m|Discharge}} to create sparks around [[Contest Hall|the stadium]] before using {{m|Sweet Kiss}} and creating a shower of small hearts. The crowd applauds at her comeback.\n\nOther {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s perform before [[Jessie]] takes the stage disguised as Jessilina, calling upon her {{TP|Jessie|Seviper}}. Meanwhile, Dawn relaxes nervously backstage as {{si|Kenny}} complements her performance, but she doesn\'t believe he is sincere as they watch Jessie\'s performance. Dawn asks Kenny about when he started taking an interest in {{pkmn|Contest}}s, but Kenny told her she never noticed. On stage, Seviper literally {{m|wrap}}s Jessie for a good [[appeal]].\n\nKenny performs last with his {{p|Alakazam}}. It uses {{m|Light Screen}} to box itself in before using {{m|Shadow Ball}} to shatter the box and quickly using {{m|Teleport}} to escape. It follows with {{m|Hidden Power}} to envelop it in a ring while {{a|Levitate|levitating up}}, ending with a fireworks appeal. While the [[Contest Judge]]s decide, {{Ash}} and {{an|Brock}} go backstage to calm a nervous Dawn. The judges announce the final eight, with Kenny, Jessie and Dawn making it in. The computer randomly pairs up the Coordinators for the [[Contest Battle]]s, pitting Dawn against Jessie in the first round. Ash and Brock leave, wishing both Dawn and Kenny luck, as Dawn and Kenny anticipate that they will face each other in the final round. Kenny mentions that he watched her {{ci|Jubilife}} [[DP011|performance]] and wanted to duel her, being the reason he entered the {{to|Floaroma}} Contest.\n\nThe battle between Jessie and Dawn begins as {{TP|Jessie|Dustox}} goes against {{TP|Dawn|Piplup}}. Dustox uses {{m|Whirlwind}} as Piplup jumps into the wind and spins in place, building up power for a {{m|Peck}} attack. The move appeal robs Jessie of some points before Dustox uses {{m|Poison Sting}} to force Piplup to stop attacking, dropping Dawn\'s points. Dustox unleashes multiple {{m|Psybeam}} attacks, Piplup dodging continually before Dustox uses Poison Sting, the forced defense depleting Dawn\'s points. Piplup uses {{m|Bide}} to take the Poison Sting bombardment before unleashing the energy, slashing Jessie\'s points to half, but Dustox survives the attack. Dustox retaliates with Poison Sting, but Piplup dodges and hits with Peck, [[fainting|knocking Dustox out]] and giving Dawn the win.\n\nThe Contest jumps ahead to the final round, where Kenny and Dawn face off after besting their prior opponents, revitalizing a childhood [[rival]]ry as Dawn\'s Piplup faces off against [[Kenny\'s Prinplup]]. Piplup and Prinplup both use {{m|Bubble Beam}}, canceling each other out and creating sparkles. Both Kenny and Dawn lose points, but Dawn takes a bigger hit due to Prinplup\'s more powerful attack. Piplup charges with Peck as Prinplup uses {{m|Metal Claw}} to catch and toss Piplup, dropping Dawn\'s points. Prinplup stands in place, executing a {{m|Drill Peck}} as Piplup uses Bide, landing on Prinplup and spinning with Drill Peck, Dawn\'s points continuing to drop. Prinplup tosses Piplup into the air as Piplup unleashes energy, hitting Prinplup and dropping Kenny\'s points.\n\nPrinplup recovers and attacks with Metal Claw, but Piplup flip dodges and uses {{m|Whirlpool}}, consuming Prinplup and dropping Kenny\'s points to half. However, Prinplup uses Bubble Beam to destroy the Whirlpool, creating sparkles and setting Dawn\'s points even to Kenny\'s. Prinplup uses {{m|Mist}} to cloak the battlefield, dropping Dawn\'s points more. Prinplup comes down with Drill Peck, but Piplup uses Whirlpool and jumps into the whirlpool to dodge, droppings Kenny\'s points. Piplup prepares Peck as Prinplup jumps into the whirlpool as well. Prinplup\'s Metal Claw and Piplup\'s Peck connect, tossing both Pokémon out of the pool and dropping both points. Both use Bubble Beam again, resulting in a cancellation. Time runs out, and Dawn wins the Contest by just a small point difference.\n\nDawn accepts her first [[Ribbon]] from [[Raoul Contesta|Mr. Contesta]] as she holds it high. Afterwards, Dawn calls [[Johanna|her mom]] and shows her Ribbon, boasting about her first win. Dawn and Ash high-five as Kenny wishes both of them well before walking out, calling Dawn Dee-Dee once again. Ash tries to ask what it means, but Dawn pushes him off the subject.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:Dawn Floaroma Ribbon.png|thumb|220px|Dawn holding the Floaroma Ribbon]]\n* {{si|Kenny}} is revealed to own an {{p|Alakazam}}.\n* {{an|Dawn}}, Kenny, and [[Jessie|Jessilina]] advance to the [[Contest Battle|Battle Stage]] of the [[Floaroma Town]] [[Pokémon Contest]].\n* Dawn defeats Kenny in the final round and wins the Floaroma Contest.\n* Dawn earns her first Contest [[Ribbon]], the [[a:File:Floaroma Ribbon.png|Floaroma Ribbon]].\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* {{si|Kenny}}\n* [[Johanna]]\n* [[Marian]]\n* [[Raoul Contesta]]\n* [[Mr. Sukizo]]\n* {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s\n* Audience\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Piplup}} ({{OP|Dawn|Piplup}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Mime Jr.}} ({{OP|James|Mime Jr.}})\n* {{p|Buneary}} ({{OP|Dawn|Buneary}})\n* {{p|Pachirisu}} ({{OP|Dawn|Pachirisu}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Dustox}} ({{OP|Jessie|Dustox}})\n* {{p|Prinplup}} ({{OP|Kenny|Prinplup}})\n* {{p|Alakazam}} ({{si|Kenny}}\'s)\n* {{p|Koffing}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Kricketune}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Nidoking}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Magneton}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Magmar}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Sneasel}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Sealeo}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Solrock}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Bagon}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Buizel}} (Coordinator\'s)\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[Professor Oak\'s Big Pokémon Encyclopedia]]: [[James\'s Carnivine]]\n** Pokémon senryū: マスキッパ\u3000きょうもはらぺこ\u3000すきっぱら \'\'Masukippa, kyō mo hara peko, sukippara\'\' "{{tt|Muskippa|Carnivine}} is also starving today: empty stomach."\n* Music from \'\'[[M08|Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]\'\' and a reduced cut of [[Ready Go!]] are used as background music.\n* [[Marian]] mentions that {{si|Kenny}}\'s {{p|Alakazam}}\'s appeal is like watching a magic show, a reference to the origin of Alakazam\'s name.\n* {{TRT}} doesn\'t blast off or recite their {{motto}} in this episode.
