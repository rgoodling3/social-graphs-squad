VS Regice!!\'\') is the 190th episode of the {{series|Advanced Generation}}, and the 464th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on August 31, 2006 and in the United States on February 17, 2007.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/09_45-pace-the-final-frontier/-->\n<i>With Charizard out of the battle for his rematch against Pyramid King Brandon, Ash calls out Bulbasaur. Dusclops performs Mean Look again, while Bulbasaur wraps the Ghost-type with Leech Seed. The two Pokémon are evenly matched, but Bulbasaur takes a beating from the Fire-type move Will-O-Wisp and is affected by Confuse Ray, which causes it to use Vine Whip on itself. Because Leech Seed is taking energy from Dusclops and giving it to Bulbasaur, the Grass-type manages to stay in the fight, using SolarBeam to knock Dusclops out.\n\nBrandon sends out Ninjask next, while Ash sends out Squirtle. The two move quickly, and are perfectly matched until Ninjask blinds Squirtle with Sand-Attack. Squirtle listens for its opponent, and eventually recovers by clearing out its eyes with Hydro Pump. Squirtle strikes with Skull Bash, knocking out Ninjask. Brandon then calls out Solrock. Squirtle stays in the battle, but eventually Solrock takes it down with SolarBeam, a Grass-type move.\n\nMeanwhile, Team Rocket is sneaking into the Battle Pyramid, but they are caught and blasted away by Regirock and Registeel. In battle, Ash sends Bulbasaur back out, who does a good job of dodging. Eventually Solrock and Bulbasaur face off with their SolarBeam attacks, resulting in a double KO. Ash and Brandon send out their final Pokémon, Pikachu and Brandon\'s new Regice. Regice\'s attacks quickly ice up the field, making it hard for Pikachu to keep steady. Pikachu still makes an impact with Thunderbolt and Iron Tail, but Regice traps Pikachu and then uses Rest to heal up. Regice hits Pikachu with Ice Beam, freezing it in a block of ice, and the Electric-type is almost defeated, but Pikachu breaks out with Thunderbolt and strikes back with Iron Tail. Regice attempts to trap Pikachu and use Rest again, but Pikachu breaks down and charges with Volt Tackle, knocking out Regice.\n\nAsh is awarded the Brave Symbol, making him a Master of the Battle Frontier and entering him into the Hall of Fame. Scott offers Ash a Frontier Brain position, but he turns it down in favor of more traveling. Squirtle, Charizard, and Bulbasaur all return to their homes.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode begins where the previous one left off, just after the start of {{Ash}}\'s rematch against [[Pyramid King Brandon]]. [[Ash\'s Charizard]] has already lost a close battle to Brandon\'s {{p|Dusclops}}, and now Ash sends out {{AP|Bulbasaur}}. Dusclops fires {{m|Shadow Punch}}, and Bulbasaur takes it. Bulbasaur\'s {{m|Razor Leaf}} hits home, and Dusclops uses {{m|Mean Look}}. Bulbasaur\'s {{m|Vine Whip}} misses and it takes another Shadow Punch, sending Bulbasaur flying. Bulbasaur uses {{m|Leech Seed}}, which wraps Dusclops and saps energy. Dusclops uses {{m|Will-O-Wisp}}, but Razor Leaf negates it. Ash orders {{m|Solar Beam}}, but Dusclops fires a {{m|Confuse Ray}}, disorienting Bulbasaur and causing Solar Beam to fire towards the roof, catching {{TRT}} and sending them blasting off.\n\nBulbasaur takes another Will-O-Wisp, and tries to use Vine Whip, but the vines are out of its control and begin whipping Bulbasaur itself. Another Will-O-Wisp sends Bulbasaur flying, and Ash catches it. The vines attacks itself and Ash. Ash yells out to Bulbasaur, and Bulbasaur snaps out of its confusion. With Bulbasaur no longer confused, Ash orders Bulbasaur to try Solar Beam again. While Bulbasaur is charging the attack, Dusclops tries to defeat it by firing Will-O-Wisp, but this time Bulbasaur dodges and fires Solar Beam, knocking out Dusclops.\n\nBrandon summons {{p|Ninjask}}, and Ash swaps for {{AP|Squirtle}}. Ninjask uses {{m|Aerial Ace}}, but Squirtle\'s {{m|Rapid Spin}} repels the attack. Ninjask uses {{m|Sandstorm}} to send Squirtle flying before using {{m|Double Team}} to surround it. Squirtle fires {{m|Water Gun}} at all of them, revealing Ninjask. Ninjask dodges Water Gun and strikes with Aerial Ace. Ninjask uses Sandstorm, but Squirtle\'s {{m|Hydro Pump}} neutralises it. Ninjask then uses {{m|Sand-Attack}} to blind Squirtle. Ninjask uses another Aerial Ace, but Squirtle can\'t see in order to evade. Ash tells Squirtle to listen for it. Squirtle dodges and uses Hydro Pump, but the attack goes high. Ninjask executes another Aerial Ace, but the Hydro Pump attack comes down and clears Squirtle\'s eyes, allowing it to counter with {{m|Skull Bash}} and knock out Ninjask.\n\nBrandon sends out {{p|Solrock}}. Squirtle uses Hydro Pump, but Solrock\'s {{m|Psywave}} pushes it back. {{m|Confusion}} stops Skull Bash and sends Squirtle back. Solrock fires {{m|Shadow Ball}} but Squirtle uses Hydro Pump against the wall to dodge. Squirtle attempts a Rapid Spin, but Solrock dodges. Squirtle crashes into the wall and takes Solrock\'s Solar Beam, an attack which takes out Squirtle.\n\nAsh sends Bulbasaur back out. Solrock uses Psywave, but Bulbasaur dodges and fires Razor Leaf. Solrock uses Confusion to stop the attack, and sends the leaves back at Bulbasaur. Bulbasaur charges with Vine Whip, but Solrock uses Confusion again to sends Bulbasaur flying, but it bounces off the wall. Solrock fires Shadow Ball, but Bulbasaur dodges. It fires Leech Seed, hitting Solrock and begins sapping away its energy. Solrock fires another Psywave, hitting Bulbasaur. Bulbasaur fires Solar Beam, which Solrock matches with its own. Both attacks collide, and the force causes a double knockout.\n\nUnderneath, Team Rocket digs into the chamber where {{DL|Brandon\'s Legendary titans|Regirock}} and {{DL|Brandon\'s Legendary titans|Registeel}} are kept. They use {{m|Lock-On}} to target Team Rocket, before firing dual {{m|Hyper Beam}} attacks that send Team Rocket flying.\n\nAsh sends {{AP|Pikachu}} out, and Brandon calls upon {{DL|Brandon\'s Legendary titans|Regice}}. Scott realizes that this must be the Pokémon that Brandon had discovered earlier. Pikachu fires {{m|Thunderbolt}}, which Regice endures easily. Regice uses {{m|Blizzard}}, which Pikachu takes. Pikachu attacks with {{m|Iron Tail}}, with Regice countering with {{m|Ice Beam}}. Pikachu dodges, but the attack freezes one half of the field and negates the attack. Pikachu uses {{m|Quick Attack}}, but Regice negates it with another Ice Beam, which freezes the other half of the field. With the field covered in ice, Regice can move quicker, but Pikachu ends up slipping. Regice attempts to use {{m|Focus Punch}}, but Pikachu uses Thunderbolt to {{status|Paralysis|paralyze}} Regice, and then strikes the Iceberg Pokémon with Iron Tail. Regice uses Ice Beam to freeze the stadium more, creating a tomb of ice pillars that trap Pikachu.\n\nWith Pikachu immobilized, Regice uses {{m|Rest}}. Pikachu uses Iron Tail to free himself. Pikachu races towards Regice, but it wakes up and fires Ice Beam, this time making a direct hit and freezing Pikachu in an ice pillar. Ash orders Thunderbolt, but Pikachu seems unable to. The referee begins to declare Pikachu [[fainting|unable to battle]], but Pikachu uses Thunderbolt to shatter the ice and paralyze Regice again. Regice fires another Focus Punch to send Pikachu bouncing across the ice field. Ash manages to get Pikachu to use two Iron Tails in a row due to the ice. Regice uses Ice Beam to trap Pikachu in another icy tomb before using Rest again. Pikachu frees himself with Iron Tail and starts charging forward with {{m|Volt Tackle}}. Regice wakes up and uses Ice Beam to try to freeze him again, but Pikachu dodges and hits Regice before it can launch another attack, knocking it out. Ash wins the match.\n\nBrandon gives Ash the [[Symbol|Brave Symbol]], completing Ash\'s {{Gdis|Battle Frontier|III}} quest. [[Scott]] hands Ash a plaque with all seven Symbols on it, acknowledging his position in the [[Hall of Fame]], and offers Ash a [[Frontier Brain]] position. Ash declines, stating that he wants to travel more, but Scott tells him that should he change his mind, the offer will always be open to him. Brandon and the [[Battle Pyramid]] take off. Bulbasaur heads back to [[Professor Oak\'s Laboratory]], Squirtle returns to the [[Squirtle Squad]], and Charizard returns to the [[Charicific Valley]].\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:Ash Brave Symbol.png|thumb|220px|Ash holding the Brave Symbol]]\n* {{Ash}} continues his [[rematch]] against {{FB|Pyramid King|Brandon}} and wins, earning the [[Symbol|Brave Symbol]] and entering the {{Gdis|Battle Frontier|III}} [[Hall of Fame]].\n* [[Scott]] offers Ash a position as a [[Frontier Brain]], but Ash turns it down.\n* [[Ash\'s Bulbasaur]], {{AP|Charizard}}, and {{AP|Squirtle}} return to [[Professor Oak\'s Laboratory]], the [[Charicific Valley]], and the [[Squirtle Squad]], respectively.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n=====TV episode debuts =====\n* {{p|Regice}} ({{DL|Brandon\'s Legendary titans|Regice|Brandon\'s}})\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{an|Professor Oak}}\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* [[Officer Jenny]]\n* {{FB|Pyramid King|Brandon}}\n* [[Scott]]\n* [[Samuel]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Bulbasaur}} ({{OP|Ash|Bulbasaur}})\n* {{p|Charizard}} ({{OP|Ash|Charizard}})\n* {{p|Squirtle}} ({{OP|Ash|Squirtle}})\n* {{p|Regirock}} ({{DL|Brandon\'s Legendary titans|Regirock|Brandon\'s}})\n* {{p|Registeel}} ({{DL|Brandon\'s Legendary titans|Registeel|Brandon\'s}})\n* {{p|Dusclops}} ({{FB|Pyramid King|Brandon}}\'s)\n* {{p|Ninjask}} ({{FB|Pyramid King|Brandon}}\'s)\n* {{p|Solrock}} ({{FB|Pyramid King|Brandon}}\'s)\n* {{p|Regice}} ({{DL|Brandon\'s Legendary titans|Regice|Brandon\'s}})\n* {{p|Chansey}} ({{OP|Nurse Joy|Chansey}})\n* {{p|Meganium}} ([[Vincent\'s Meganium|Jackson\'s]]; flashback)\n* {{p|Arbok}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Exeggutor}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Zangoose}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Seviper}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Metagross}} (flashback)\n\n==Trivia==\n* Background music from \'\'[[M06|Jirachi: Wish Maker]]\'\' and \'\'[[M08|Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]\'\', as well as the TV cut of {{so|Battle Frontier}}, are used as background music.\n* {{Ash}} and {{an|May}} narrate the preview for [[AG191|the next episode]].\n* The dub episode title is a pun on the famous phrase "Space, The Final Frontier" from the sci-fi series \'\'{{wp|Star Trek}}\'\'.\n* This episode marks the second time one of Ash\'s Pokémon defeats a Legendary Pokémon.
