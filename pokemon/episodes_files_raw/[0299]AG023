It was first broadcast in Japan on May 1, 2003 and in the United States on February 21, 2004. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/06_35-gone-corphishin/-->\n<i>The episode opens with Team Rocket lounging on the beach when suddenly a mysterious creature zooms along the beach and launches Team Rocket out of sight. Later on, Ash and his friends are relaxing and doing their laundry on the same beach. Ash is busy teaching his Pokémon how to meditate. The unnamed creature from before begins to carry off the gang\'s tent. Wurmple uses String Shot to try to stop it, but is unsuccessful and the creature escapes.\n\nEveryone is speculating what kind of Pokémon the creature could be and Ash decides he wants to catch it. Later on, Team Rocket sees the creature speeding down the beach again and try to go after it, but have a run-in with a Loudred. Ash and the gang set out Pokémon food to attract the elusive Pokémon and end up being chased by it instead. They get split up, but the attacker is thwarted by Pikachu\'s Thundershock. The next morning, Brock asks his Forretress to make a large hole so that they can catch the creature. The only thing they end up catching is Team Rocket. The mysterious Pokémon then emerges and sends Team Rocket blasting off again. Pikachu takes the opportunity to use Quick Attack on it and they discover that the troublesome Pokémon is a Corphish. Brock advises Ash to catch the Corphish to use against Brawly, but the Corphish is too strong for Pikachu. Treecko eventually saves the day and Ash gets to add Corphish to his team. </i>\n\n==Plot==\n[[James]] and {{MTR}} proclaim that it is a great day to steal {{AP|Pikachu}}. [[Jessie]], however, just wants to relax as she lies on a lounge chair in the shade of a beach umbrella. They begin to complain, but she continues to relax, taking a sip of her tropical beverage. Tensions escalate as {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} stretches out on another chair. While they fight, a strange creature speeds towards the beach from the ocean. Jessie notices it and screams. The mysterious creature rams them from under the sand, sending the trio flying. It then burrows into the ground and away from the scene.\n\nAs the morning sun radiates over [[Dewford Island]], {{Ash}} declares it is a perfect day for a lot of {{pkmn|training}} in preparation for his [[rematch]] against [[Brawly]]. As {{TP|Brock|Lotad}} waddles up with some water, he and {{AP|Pikachu}} begin to wash their faces. {{an|May}} and [[Max]] sit at a nearby table brushing their teeth while {{an|Brock}} and {{TP|May|Torchic}} start a fire to prepare a stew. Ash releases his {{AP|Taillow}} and {{AP|Treecko}}, and they--along with Pikachu--begin to meditate on the shoreline. Ash starts to explain to {{cat|Ash\'s Pokémon|his Pokémon}} the importance of meditating, and for them to think about winning their upcoming rematch. Max sits at the edge of a pool of water washing clothes, and {{TP|Brock|Forretress}} collects and dries the clothes with its {{m|Rapid Spin}} attack. Max thanks it before bringing the washing over to May to hang on the line. May is curious about Ash\'s meditation, and Brock informs her that meditating is actually a form of training, as it improves the patience of Ash and his Pokémon for their battles.\n\nA large wave approaches the shore. Taillow begins to freak out, but Ash tells it to keep meditating, because if it can learn how to sense the waves, they may be able to beat Brawly and his surfing techniques. Taillow shuts its eyes and continues to meditate as Ash listens intently. As wave grows larger and nearer, Ash orders them all to get out of the way. However, the wave proves too quick, leaving Ash and his Pokémon soaked. May and Max complain about Ash\'s training and that they\'re stuck doing all the laundry. Brock replies that training isn\'t always about Pokémon. Ash and his Pokémon return to their practice. This time they all get up in time, except for Treecko who doesn\'t open its eyes in time. Ash cannot understand why Treecko didn\'t move, but he swipes back at May\'s comment and suggests she try practicing for her [[Pokémon Contest]]s. Max turns to his sister and asks if she is ready. As Brock brings the group some tea, May leaps up and says she has been practicing her entrance. She then spins around and sends out Torchic and {{TP|May|Wurmple}}. The two begin to play around, but May comments that they have to learn to be more graceful, and she recites her dance routine. Max points out that {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s can\'t let out two {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} at the same time in Pokémon Contests, and Brock adds it will not be a good idea for May to dance around like that, since in Pokémon Contests the focus is always placed on the Pokémon. May admits that she wasn\'t aware of the rules and was focused on her choreography, which she based on {{Steven}}\'s smooth battle style.\n\nSuddenly, they all notice that the tent is walking away. The group gives chase and Ash orders Pikachu to shock it, but Brock stops him and explains that an {{t|Electric}} attack might set the tent ablaze. The menace soon crashes into a tree and it begins to flee underground. May tells Wurmple to stop it with {{m|String Shot}}, but as it tries to reel it in, Wumple is pulled along. Treecko grabs on to help, but it is also dragged forward. Ash and the others all grab the thread and start to heave, but the creature drags them along the beach. It soon retreats to the water, causing everyone to fall in. Once everyone\'s clothes are hung up to dry, Ash stands on the beach covered in sand. They inspect the damaged tent and the ruined rice balls that litter the beach, wondering what could have done such a thing. The group considers that {{p|Diglett}} or an {{p|Aron}} might be the culprit. Brock begins to sew the tent up while exclaiming that a Pokémon that could pull all of them like that must be really strong, but May just thinks it was scary. Ash declares that he wants to catch it. Brock and Max agree to help, but May just sighs.\n\nMeanwhile, up on a cliff, Team Rocket is recovering from their earlier blastoff. Jessie remarks that the menace hasn\'t seen the last of Team Rocket. Wobbuffet pops out at the edge of the cliff and Jessie turns to recall it in exasperation. She then notices the mysterious creature speeding up the beach under the sand, and she points it out to her teammates. Jessie sets off on foot to get her revenge, but accidentally steps on a sleeping {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Loudred}}. Jessie steps back and freaks out as the Pokémon angrily wakes up. It lets out a cry which sends Team Rocket sky high. \n\nThat night, Ash and friends sit by some bushes and wait for the mysterious creature to take their bait. May complains that she is tired and wants to go to bed, but Ash refuses to sleep. Max angers May with a smart-mouthed comment and she begins to hug him tightly because she is scared. Pikachu then hears something and Ash asks if the creature is close. As they wait, Ash suddenly hears something behind him, but it is too late. The creature smashes into them, sending them all flying onto the beach. It continues its pursuit, prompting the group to split up. It sets its sights on May as she runs screaming in fear. Ash turns around and tells Pikachu to {{m|Thunderbolt}} it. The attack hits, but the menace quickly disappears underground and without a trace.\nThe following morning, the group is slumped against the tent in exhaustion. May cries out that they should not waste their time catching it and demands they move to another camping spot. However the others disagree, keen to find out what the mysterious creature is. Ash adds that he saw a red "horn" protrude from the sand after it was hit by Pikachu\'s earlier attack. He quotes one of {{an|Professor Oak}}\'s poems, admitting that the culprit is likely to return once again. The group then heads back to the beach and Brock has Forretress make several huge holes in the sand with Rapid Spin. Ash explains that they are going to use create pitfall traps, and the tactic instantly reminds May and Max of Team Rocket’s classic trick. Everyone proceeds to cover over the holes with leaves and sand. \n\nThat night, the group waits in the bushes again while watching the [[Pokémon food]]. Ash alerts everyone as four large bunches of seaweed emerge from the water. They walk up and begin to eat the Pokémon food. Brock says the plan is working and he sets some more food on a nearby rock. One of the seaweed bunches spies this and they head towards the new food, only to fall into a hole. The group approaches, only to discover that they have snagged Team Rocket. As Jessie and James begin their {{motto}}, May and Max interrupt, asking why they were covered and seaweed and eating Pokémon food. Team Rocket cowers in the hole, saying they had to make do. Suddenly, the creature emerges from the hole and smashes into Team Rocket, sending them blasting off again. The creature slides up the side of the pitfall and heads towards the bait, but Pikachu uses {{m|Quick Attack}}, sending it flying out of the sand. It lands with a thud and is revealed to be a {{AP|Corphish}}.\n\nAsh scans it with the [[Pokédex]], and Brock adds its territorial behavior is a classic trait of Corphish. Ash reiterates his desire to catch Corphish, fully aware of its incredible speed and power. He sends in Pikachu as Corphish gets up. Max thinks the battle will be easy for Ash, as Corphish is at a disadvantage due to being a Water type. Pikachu starts with Thunderbolt, but Corphish dodges and uses {{m|Bubble Beam}}. It then burrows into the sand, leaving Pikachu confused. Corphish soon emerges, sending Pikachu flying into the air. As he descends, Pikachu tries to use {{m|Iron Tail}}, but Corphish catches him with its pincers and chucks him at Ash. Brock remarks that this Corphish is stronger than anticipated, and that Ash has a challenge on his hands. Ash agrees and calls on Treecko for assistance. Ash tells Treecko to meditate, and it closes its eyes and stands there. Max and May are astounded by the tactic, but Brock reassures them that Ash has a plan. The sun begins to rise and Corphish becomes impatient. It uses Bubble Beam, but Ash tells Treecko to hit them away. It uses {{m|Pound}} to break through the attack. Corphish begins to steam and rushes in for a {{m|Crabhammer}}, but Treecko lashes it with a Quick Attack, sending the Corphish flying. Treecko follows up with Pound and Corphish lands on the ground. Ash instantly throws a {{i|Poké Ball}}, officially catching Corphish. Brock commends Ash on his strategy of using Corphish\'s own impatience against it, while Max adds that at least Ash has learned from his [[AG020|earlier]] [[Dewford Gym]] loss. Ash calls Corphish out and kneels down to introduce himself. Corphish smiles and shakes his hand, but ends up tossing Ash in the process. Everyone laughs at Corphish\'s overwhelming strength before going over to check if Ash is okay.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:Ash catching Corphish.png|thumb|220px|Ash after catching Corphish]]\n* {{Ash}} catches a {{AP|Corphish}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* [[Ash\'s Corphish]]\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP AG023.png|thumb|200px|right|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Shroomish}}\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Taillow}} ({{OP|Ash|Taillow}})\n* {{p|Treecko}} ({{OP|Ash|Treecko}})\n* {{p|Corphish}} ({{OP|Ash|Corphish}}; new)\n* {{p|Torchic}} ({{OP|May|Torchic}})\n* {{p|Wurmple}} ({{OP|May|Wurmple}})\n* {{p|Forretress}} ({{OP|Brock|Forretress}})\n* {{p|Lotad}} ({{OP|Brock|Lotad}})\n* {{p|Loudred}} ({{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Loudred|anime}})\n* {{p|Sandslash}}\n* {{p|Diglett}} (fantasy)\n* {{p|Krabby}} (fantasy)\n* {{p|Aron}} (fantasy)\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[Advance Adventure]] is used as background music.\n* The English title is a pun on the phrase "\'\'gone fishing\'\'".\n* {{TRT}} [[Breaking the fourth wall|breaks the fourth wall]] at the beginning of the episode when they shout, "We\'re blasting off too soon!"\n* While digging the pitfalls, {{an|Brock}} explains in the [[dub]] that the holes should work after all the "years" he and {{Ash}} had been falling into Team Rocket\'s traps.
