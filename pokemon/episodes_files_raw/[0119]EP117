The Town Where Winds Telling of a Beginning Blow!\'\') is the 117th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on October 14, 1999 and in the United States on October 14, 2000. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/03_12-dont-touch-that-dile/-->\n<i>Ash begins his journey in Johto, a largely unexplored region said to be thickly populated with Pokémon entirely new to him and his friends.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nWalking through a foggy forest, {{Ash}}, {{an|Misty}}, and {{an|Brock}} are heading to [[New Bark Town]] to register for the [[Johto League]]. Ash notices a familiar tree branch and declares that they must be lost. Misty scolds Ash, and the two of them get into an argument, which Brock is forced to break up. {{TP|Misty|Togepi}} senses something and promptly hops out of Misty\'s arms, prompting the others to follow. The group is startled after seeing a mysterious blue {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}, later revealed to be {{p|Suicune}}, on a formation in the middle of the lake. When Suicune notices them, it runs away. Ash tries to follow it but falls off a steep edge, and {{AP|Pikachu}} and Togepi soon follow. Becoming alarmed by his disappearance, Misty and Brock go after Ash, but they also trip and fall. {{an|Jigglypuff}} walks by and seems to find it fun before sliding down the hill as well.\n\nMeanwhile, {{TRT}} is also lost in the same fog-filled forest. They become hungry and decide to run, and soon find themselves out of the forest and staring at a large building. The trio is started by a [[horde]] of {{p|Fearow}} and rush inside what is actually a Pokémon Lab. A voice suddenly speaks up, and the group soon finds the source, [[Professor Elm]]. He is too busy looking through his microscope to realize the visitors are Team Rocket; thinking it is [[Nurse Joy]], he tells them to check up on his {{p|Totodile}}. They encounter Totodile shortly after, and it bites onto {{MTR}}\'s tail and sprays a {{m|Water Gun}} at [[James]]\'s face. Posing as Nurse Joy, [[Jessie]] says she will bring Totodile back to the [[Pokémon Center]] before picking Totodile up and running out of the lab, followed by James and Meowth.\n\nUpon reaching New Bark Town, Ash and {{ashfr}} head for the Pokémon Center, but when they reach it, they are met by [[Nurse Joy\'s Chansey]]. She presses a button after Brock speculates on Chansey not being Nurse Joy, and a screen appears. A recording of Nurse Joy plays on the screen, saying that she is with Professor Elm and will be back by 2:00. Noting the time on the clock, Misty realizes that it is 3:30. Ash and Misty decide to sit down as they wait, though Brock is furious and demands that they go find her. However, when the three of them reach Elm\'s laboratory, they see police officers led by [[Officer Jenny]] surrounding the premises. Brock tries to offer Jenny a bouquet of flowers, but Misty pulls him away by his collar.\n\nAsh, Brock, and Misty rush inside the lab and see Nurse Joy scolding Elm for being careless. Brock tries to flirt with Nurse Joy as well but is pulled away by Misty again. Ash and his friends then learn about the stolen Totodile, who was supposed to be picked up a female {{pkmn|Trainer}}. They also learn about [[Johto]]\'s [[starter Pokémon]]. Ash mentions that he is from [[Pallet Town]] and is questioned about having met {{an|Professor Oak}}. Then, Elm rants to Brock about his time as one of Oak\'s top students while Misty and Ash play with the {{p|Cyndaquil}} that Nurse Joy took from Elm. After this, one of the police officers brings a plaster mold of Team Rocket\'s [[footprint]]s. [[Officer Jenny\'s Growlithe]] sniffs the mold and begins to tracks down Team Rocket and Totodile.\n\nMeanwhile, Team Rocket decides to take a break at a local park, and Jessie is furious when Totodile chomps down on her hair. Meowth goes to make a phone call to {{an|Giovanni|the Boss}}, though Jessie smacks him away with the phone booth door and claims that he would take all of the credit. While the two of them argue, James walks past them and makes the phone call. At that moment, Ash, his friends, and Officer Jenny arrive on the scene. Team Rocket recites their {{motto}} and comment that they can\'t return Totodile because it won\'t let go of Jessie\'s hair. Ash scolds the three for stealing a new Trainer\'s Pokémon, but Team Rocket is unfazed and attempts to run away. Ash then sends out {{AP|Bulbasaur}} and has it use {{m|Vine Whip}} to trip Team Rocket. James has {{TP|James|Weezing}} use {{m|Smokescreen}}, but [[Ash\'s Charizard]] blows the smog away.\n\nBulbasaur manages to pull Totodile off Jessie\'s hair, and the Pokémon lands in Ash\'s arms. As {{TP|Officer Jenny|Growlithe}} goes in to apprehend the trio, Weezing\'s {{m|Sludge}} leaves it blinded. James uses the opportunity to call on {{TP|James|Victreebel}}, who latches onto his head. Jessie resorts to using {{TP|Jessie|Lickitung}}. Ash sends out {{AP|Squirtle}}, and its Water Gun hits Lickitung. Desperate to flee, Jessie calls out {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}}, and together with Team Rocket\'s other Pokémon, they attempt a group attack. Ash replies with his own group effort: Pikachu\'s {{m|Thunderbolt}}, Charizard\'s {{m|Flamethrower}}, Bulbasaur\'s {{m|Razor Leaf}} and Squirtle\'s Water Gun combine and send Team Rocket\'s Pokémon flying. To finish things off, Totodile sends Jessie, James, and Meowth on their way with a Water Gun. Officer Jenny is disappointed not to have made any arrests, but is grateful that Totodile is safe and sound.\n\nBack at Elm\'s lab, Ash makes a call through to Oak. Ash speaks briefly before letting Elm talk to his former mentor. As the two Professors get deep into conversation, Nurse Joy arrives and escorts Ash and his friends to the Pokémon Center. There, she officially registers Ash for the Johto League. Ash and his friends then leave New Bark Town, unaware of Jigglypuff, who is still following after them.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

Instead, the music debuts in \'\'[[EP123|Spinarak Attack]]\'\', the first episode to air after the release of Gold and Silver in Japan.\n* This episode is featured on \'\'Volume 16: Totodile\'\' from [[Viz Media]]\'s {{OBP|Pokémon All-Stars|Region 1}} series.\n* This episode is featured on \'\'Pokémon All-Stars: Totodile\'\' from {{wp|Magna Pacific}}\'s {{OBP|Pokémon All-Stars|Region 4}} series.\n* The book [[Go West, Young Ash]] is based on this episode.\n* When [[Professor Elm]] talks to {{an|Professor Oak}}, he mentions an article in a magazine called {{DL|Magazines in the Pokémon world|National Pokégraphic}}, which is a reference to the real-life magazine \'\'{{wp|National Geographic}}\'\'.\n* This episode marks a rare instance in which Team Rocket\'s Pokémon blast off before Team Rocket themselves. It is also the first time where they are marked as individual twinkling stars as opposed to a single one after blasting off.\n* In the {{pmin|Finland|Finnish}} dub, the first eight episodes of the third season had rather poor sound mixing, as some of the lines were too loud and the others were fairly quiet, and the English dub soundtrack may be silently audible in the background.\n* Music from \'\'[[PK01|Pikachu\'s Vacation]]\'\' and \'\'[[M01|Mewtwo Strikes Back]]\'\' can be heard in this episode.\n* On DVD releases of [[S03|Pokémon: The Johto Journeys]], this episode is considered the season premiere. However, on televised airings, that title falls to \'\'[[EP106|The Pokémon Water War]]\'\'.\n\n===Errors===\n* In one scene, when [[James]] was going to make a phone call, he did not have any gloves for a second. In the next scene, he had gloves as usual.\n* Towards the end, when Ash\'s Pokémon all attack at once, {{AP|Bulbasaur}} uses {{m|Razor Leaf}}, but the sound for {{m|Vine Whip}} can be heard.\n* When the plaster cast is made of Team Rocket\'s footprints, the prints are indents in the plaster, when really they should be protruding from the cast.\n* In the scene where all of Ash\'s Pokémon defeat Team Rocket, {{AP|Charizard}}\'s wings are completely orange. In the next scene, they are back to normal.\n* In the European Portuguese dub, when Ash is naming the Kanto starters, he says Charizard instead of Charmander.\n* In the {{pmin|the Netherlands|Dutch}} dub, [[Jessie]] calls her {{TP|Jessie|Lickitung}} "Lickingtung".\n\n<gallery>\nEP117 Error.png|James\'s missing glove\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[Pokémon Karaokémon]]: [[You & Me & Pokémon]]\n* Misty\'s claim that they may find another Pokémon like {{p|Suicune|the one they saw}} in the woods was originally her wondering what the Pokémon was.\n* Ash asking about an entrance fee for the [[Johto League]] was in the dub only.\n* Professor Oak\'s "They always call in the middle of my soap operas" line was originally just him saying, "Hello, this is the Oak Laboratory."\n* The dub omitted Professor Elm\'s mention that the [[Starter Pokémon|starter trio]] Ash had with him are given out in Pallet Town.\n* Ash mentioning [[Gary Oak]] was dub-added.\n* The dub implies that the {{pkmn|Trainer}} that {{p|Totodile}} will receive is female, whereas the Japanese version doesn\'t state the gender of the Trainer picking up Totodile. Interestingly, later in the anime, a female Trainer named {{jo|Marina}} is seen with a Totodile that she received from Professor Elm.\n* Originally, Professor Elm doesn\'t specify when Totodile\'s Trainer would show up.\n* In the dub, {{an|Misty}} reveals that {{Ash}} slept in until 4:00 PM in the [[EP001|first episode]], while Misty doesn\'t specify any time in the original version.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|bg={{tt|Не пипай този Тотодайл!|Do not touch this Totodile!}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|若葉鎮，吹起開啟之風的城鎮|Ruòyè (New Bark) Town, Where Winds of a New Beginning Blow}}\n|cs={{tt|Nesahej na toho krokodýla|Don\'t touch that crocodile}}\n|nl={{tt|Kom Niet Aan Die Totodile|Don\'t touch that Totodile}}\n|de={{tt|Finger weg von Karnimani|Hands off Totodile}}\n|fi={{tt|Näpit irti Totosta!|Keep your hands off Toto(dile)!}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Le crime ne paie pas|Crime does not pay}}\n|he=גניבת הטוטודייל {{tt|\'\'Gnivat ha\'Totodile\'\'|The Totodile theft}}\n|hu={{tt|Nebánts virág|Touch-me-not}}\n|it={{tt|Un\'iscrizione difficile|A difficult registration}}{{tt|*|Original 2000 dub}} <br> {{tt|Il Totodile rubato|The stolen Totodile}}{{tt|*|2014 K2 TV dub}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Com o Totodile não se Brinca|With the Totodile not Play}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Não Toques no \'dile|Don\'t touch that \'dile}}\n|es_la={{tt|El robo de Totodile!|Totodile\'s theft}}\n|es_eu={{tt|No toqueis a ese \'dile|Don\'t touch that \'dile}}\n|sv={{tt|Framtidsvindarna|The winds of future}}\n|pl={{tt|Nie dotykaj tego!|Don\'t touch this!}}\n|ro={{tt|Nu Atinge Acel \'Dile|Don\'t Touch That \'Dile}}\n|hi=Totodile को हाथ मत लगाना {{tt|\'\'Totodile ko haath mat lagana\'\'|Don\'t touch Totodile}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}} \n}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP116 |\nprevtitle=The Rivalry Revival |\nnextcode=EP118 |\nnexttitle=The Double Trouble Header |\nseries=Original series |\nepisodelist=List of original series episodes |\ncolorscheme=Johto}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0117}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|117]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Atsuhiro Tomioka]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded and directed by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Masaaki Iwane]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a Legendary Pokémon appears]]\n\n[[de:Finger weg von Karnimani!]]\n[[es:EP119]]\n[[fr:EP117]]\n[[it:EP117]]\n[[ja:無印編第117話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第118集]]'}
