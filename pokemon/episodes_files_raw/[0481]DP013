It first aired in Japan, as part of a one-hour special along with [[DP014]], on December 21, 2006, and in the United States on June 25, 2007.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/10_13-a-staravia-is-born/-->\n<i>Ash is traveling through the forest on his way to Oreburgh City, where he hopes to earn his first Gym Badge in Sinnoh. But first he\'s helping Starly practice using Aerial Ace, a process that doesn\'t go entirely smoothly. Our heroes also catch the attention of Rosebay, a woman who monitors the Pokémon that live in the forest. Lots of Pokémon have been disappearing lately and she\'s not sure why, but it doesn\'t take long for Ash and his friends to decide they should help her out!\n\nMeanwhile, Team Rocket have set up a trap in the Valley Path, an area which Flying-type Pokémon often pass through. All it takes some netting and soon Team Rocket is happily snagging lots of avian Pokémon for their Boss. When Ash sends Starly out to look for clues, Starly is swept up by Team Rocket\'s criminal plans as well—but Starly isn\'t about to sit back and wait to be rescued! Jessie and James leave Meowth to guard their ill-gotten Pokémon, and Starly is ready to stage a jailbreak together with help from a captured Hoothoot.\n\nHoothoot hypnotizes Meowth into letting the Pokémon go, but when Meowth snaps out of its trance, it calls for backup from Team Rocket\'s other Pokémon. However, Ash and his friends came across a Pidgeot trapped in Team Rocket\'s net and realized what was going on, and they show up looking for Starly! Jessie and James return and try to stop our heroes, only to discover that Brock\'s Bonsly can use Mimic to send their Pokémon\'s moves right back at them. Then Starly evolves into Staravia and pulls off a terrific Aerial Ace—which is also the term that describes Team Rocket as they go blasting off again. The trapped Pokémon are freed, Rosebay is happy, and now it\'s onward to Oreburgh City!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} is in the midst of some special {{pkmn|training}} with {{AP|Starly}}. He orders an {{m|Aerial Ace}}, and Starly does so, flying along the ground towards a target on a tree trunk. Ash tells him to pull up, and he flies up the trunk of the tree, before looping around for another go. However, this time Aerial Ace fails, and Starly crash-lands, injuring his leg. The group rushes over to Starly, and {{an|Brock}} says that it is just a minor injury, proceeding to treat him with a spritz of [[Potion]] and a bandage. Ash comments that they still need to do some more practice on Aerial Ace.\n\nA nearby bush rustles and [[Rosebay]] steps out of it. Brock is immediately infatuated, but {{TP|Brock|Croagunk}} uses {{m|Poison Jab}}s to stop him flirting. Rosebay reveals that she is observing the {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} in the forest, and invites the group to join her. Rosebay then shows them a {{p|Swablu}} nest, but the nest is oddly empty. So Rosebay leads the group to higher ground, before commenting that the Swablu should have returned to the nest by that time. She also mentions that the bird Pokémon population has recently been shrinking, so the group offers to help her solve the mystery. Their search reveals that a local {{p|Hoothoot}} colony is strangely absent. Meanwhile in a nearby pass, {{TRT}}’s gigantic net trap captures a flock of migrating {{p|Taillow}} and {{p|Swellow}}. {{MTR}} and his teammates marvel at their success, and plan on handing some of the bird Pokémon over to {{an|Giovanni}}. While aiding the search effort, Ash’s Starly soon joins the caged Pokémon. Ash begins to worry about Starly, as he has been gone a long time. Rosebay realizes that all the bird Pokémon use the valley path, so that must be where they are. The group decides to hurry there as Starly might be in trouble.\n\nInside Team Rocket\'s secret base, Meowth reports back to [[Jessie]] and [[James]], who ask him to sort out their gift for the boss. Meowth insists on a \'vote,\' so the group plays Rock Paper Scissors. Meowth loses, and gloomily asks what the others will be doing, but is disappointed to see his teammates relaxing in the sun. Up on the edge of the valley, the group spots Team Rocket, and Rosebay notices a {{p|Pidgeot}} in Team Rocket\'s net. Ash tells {{AP|Pikachu}} to help it. Pikachu runs off and frees it from the net just as it is closing. Ash then orders Pikachu and Pidgeot to gather as many bird Pokémon as they can find, in order to tear down the net. The rest of the group runs off to free the Pokémon Team Rocket has already captured.\n\nWhile {{TP|James|Carnivine}}, {{TP|James|Cacnea}} and {{TP|Jessie|Seviper}} guard the door to the cage room, Meowth walks in and puts a ring around a Swablu, immobilizing it. Starly and Hoothoot signal each other, and Hoothoot uses {{m|Hypnosis}} on Meowth; he releases Swablu. Now under control, Meowth promptly frees the Swablu and unlocks the cages. He reveals that they will need to dig a hole upwards to escape, so he lends his claws to aid their effort. Jessie and James are too relaxed to notice Rosebay and the group sneak into their base of operations. However, the crows of dozens of bird Pokémon approaching disturbs their sunbathing. Pikachu orders his winged recruits to destroy the net trap. The group, still underground, watches on the security camera screens. Jessie and James rush to some controls, wondering where Meowth is. In the cage room Meowth and Starly are watching as all the other Pokémon leave through the escape tunnel, with Hoothoot leaving last. As Meowth snaps out of the Hypnosis, he calls in Seviper, Cacnea and Carnivine. They surround Starly, as the group runs into the room.\n\nThe ground starts to shake as Team Rocket\'s mecha rises from the ground. A ladder drops down, and Team Rocket\'s Pokémon climb the ladder into the mecha. Meowth apologizes, admitting to Jessie and James that he was Hypnotized when he freed the Pokémon. Jessie pushes a button, and nets pop out of the mecha\'s arms. The Pokémon flee out of the escape tunnel, with the group following behind. Ash yells for Pikachu to use {{m|Thunderbolt}}, but it doesn\'t affect the mecha, which is made of wood. Team Rocket then tries to stomp on the group with their mecha, but the force causes the ground underneath to collapse, destroying the mecha.\n\nAfter they climb out of the remains of their mecha, Team Rocket recites their {{motto}}. Ash\'s Starly uses {{m|Wing Attack}}, but Jessie calls out {{TP|Jessie|Dustox}}, who blows Starly away with {{m|Gust}}. James tells Cacnea to fire {{m|Pin Missile}}s at Pikachu, but he dodges using {{m|Quick Attack}}. Brock sends out {{TP|Brock|Bonsly}}. Jessie commands a Gust from Dustox. The first pushes Bonsly back, but the second time balls on Bonsly\'s head begin to glow, and Bonsly uses Gust, blocking the attack. Brock realizes that Bonsly has just learned {{m|Mimic}}. Dustox follows up with {{m|Psybeam}}, but Brock tells Bonsly to dodge it and use Mimic. The resulting Psybeam knocks out Dustox. The group charge forward, when Starly flies ahead. As it swoops upwards, Starly starts to glow and it [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{AP|Staravia}}. Staravia then uses Aerial Ace to make Team Rocket blast off. Staravia lands, and Dawn checks him on her [[Pokédex]]. Rosebay thanks Staravia for its assistance as the other bird Pokémon fly off, with Hoothoot waving goodbye to Staravia. The group leaves Rosebay and continues on their journey, with Staravia flying overhead.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}}\'s {{p|Starly}} is revealed to have started learning {{m|Aerial Ace}}.\n* [[Brock\'s Bonsly]] learns {{m|Mimic}}.\n* [[Jessie\'s Dustox]] is revealed to know {{m|Gust}}.\n* Ash\'s Starly [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{AP|Staravia}} and masters Aerial Ace.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* [[Ash\'s Staravia]]\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{an|Giovanni}} ([[Boss fantasy|fantasy]])\n* [[Rosebay]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Starly}} ({{OP|Ash|Starly}}; evolves)\n* {{p|Staravia}} ({{OP|Ash|Staravia}}; newly evolved)\n* {{p|Bonsly}} ({{OP|Brock|Bonsly}})\n* {{p|Croagunk}} ({{OP|Brock|Croagunk}})\n* {{p|Dustox}} ({{OP|Jessie|Dustox}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Cacnea}} ({{OP|James|Cacnea}})\n* {{p|Carnivine}} ({{OP|James|Carnivine}})\n* {{p|Hoothoot}}\n* {{p|Pidgeot}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Spearow}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Fearow}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Natu}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Taillow}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Swellow}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Swablu}} (multiple)\n\n==Trivia==\n* {{Ash}} trying to teach {{AP|Starly|Staraptor}} how to use {{m|Aerial Ace}} is similar to how he tried to teach {{AP|Swellow}} how to use it in \'\'[[AG091|Lessons in Lilycove]]\'\' and \'\'[[AG092|Judgment Day!]]\'\'.\n* [[Professor Oak\'s Big Pokémon Encyclopedia]]: [[Ash\'s Pikachu]]\n** Pokémon senryū: パートナー\u3000サトシとピカチュウ\u3000いいかんじ \'\'Pātonā, Satoshi to Pikachū, ii kanji\'\' "Partners Satoshi and Pikachu: a pleasant feeling."\n* The episode title is a pun of the 1937 romance drama film \'\'{{wp|A Star Is Born}}\'\'.\n* This is one of the few episodes of the {{series|Diamond & Pearl}} where [[Dawn\'s Piplup]] does not appear.\n* This is one of the few episodes in which more than two main character\'s Pokémon learns new moves.\n* The scene of Pikachu flying on {{p|Pidgeot}} in the flock of {{type|Flying}} Pokémon is very similar to one in [[EP019|another episode]], which also appeared in the [[Pokémon Theme|original opening]].\n* Staravia remains outside his {{i|Poké Ball}} for the entire episode.\n* This is the only time Ash\'s Flying-type Pokémon evolves before challenging the first [[Gym]]. <!-- Pidgeotto is not counted, since it was already in its evolved state when it was caught. -->\n\n===Errors===\n*\xa0When Ash is searching for Starly, Pikachu\'s right cheek is gone.\n*\xa0When {{MTR}} is holding a {{p|Swablu}}, a {{p|Taillow}} in the background has its belly the same color as its body.\n* In one of the scenes where Starly is learning Aerial Ace, his plume is the same color as his body.\n* In one scene, the dark-green section on {{TP|James|Cacnea}}\'s head is colored yellow.\n* After Pikachu saves Pidgeot, Pidgeot is discolored for a moment.\n* In the [[dub]], the group accidentally calls Pidgeotto its evolved form, Pidgeot, when it was in the cage.\n** This is fixed in the {{pmin|Poland|Polish}} dub.\n* In the {{pmin|Norway|Norwegian}} dub, when [[Rosebay]] asks Ash and {{ashfr}} to watch the Flying-type Pokémon, the word "bird" is treated as a proper Pokémon-noun (e.g. names and attacks) and thus not translated to Norwegian.\n* At the beginning of the Polish dub, Aerial Ace is called "\'\'Powietrzny Cios\'\'" instead of "\'\'Powietrzny As\'\'".\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FCC|bordercolor=99F\n|zh_cmn={{tt|姆克兒加油！|Starly, Do Your Best!}}\n|cs={{tt|Zrodila se Staravia|A Staravia is Born}}\n|nl={{tt|Er is een Staravia geboren!|A Staravia is Born!}}\n|fi={{tt|Staravia syntyy!|A Staravia borns!}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Un Etourvol est né !|A Staravia is born!}}\n|de={{tt|Aus der Luft ins Netz!|From the air into the net!}}\n|he={{tt|סטארביה נולד|A Staravia is Born}}\n|it={{tt|La nascita di uno Staravia|A Staravia is born}} & {{tt|La foresta è salva|The forest is safe}}\n|no={{tt|Stjernen Staravia er født!|The star Staravia is born!}}\n|pl={{tt|Narodziny Staravii|The birth of Staravia}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Nasce um Staravia!|A Staravia is Born!}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|O Nascimento de um Staravia!|The Birth of a Staravia!}}\n|ru={{tt|Старевия рождён!|A Staravia has Born!}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Ha nacido un Staravia!|A Staravia has been born!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|¡Ha nacido un Staravia!|A Staravia has been born!}}\n|sv={{tt|En Staravia föds|A Staravia is born}}\n|ro={{tt|Nașterea unui Pokémon Staravia|The Birth of a Staravia Pokémon}}\n|th={{tt|มุคคุรุพยายามเข้า|Mukkuru Does its Best}}\n|ko={{tt|찌르꼬, 친구들을 구하라|Starly, Save Your Friends}}\n}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=DP012 |\nprevtitle=Arrival of a Rival!
