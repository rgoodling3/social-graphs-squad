It first aired in Japan on April 9, 2015 and in the United States on June 13, 2015.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!-- http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/18_19-the-moment-of-lumiose-truth/ -->\n<i>After a false start, the Lumiose Gym battle between Ash and Clemont is getting under way! To begin, Clemont’s Bunnelby and Ash’s Pikachu trade the same moves they used when they first met, on Ash’s first day in the Kalos region. Bunnelby has learned some new tricks since then, but it can’t stand up against Pikachu’s Iron Tail.\n\nNext up, Clemont sends out Heliolisk, and Ash switches to Goodra. But Heliolisk moves with impressive speed, dashing around the battlefield more quickly than Goodra can follow. Ash calls Goodra back and sends out the speedy Hawlucha, but Heliolisk still seems unstoppable...until Ash notices that it pauses to spread its frills before every attack. Hawlucha times its attack just right and knocks Heliolisk out!\n\nClemont’s final Pokémon is Luxray, who uses Electric Terrain to charge up the battlefield and quickly takes down both Hawlucha and Pikachu. Ash sends Goodra back into battle and uses Rain Dance to short out the electric battlefield. Then, a clever use of Bide allows Goodra to unleash an overwhelming show of force, giving Ash the win and the Voltage Badge!\n\nSerena suggests Laverre City as the next destination, and our heroes get ready to head out—with Clemont once again by their side!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{an|Clemont}} prepare to have their long-awaited Gym battle at the [[Lumiose Gym]]. As {{an|Serena}} and {{an|Bonnie}} watch from the stands, they have {{TP|Serena|Braixen}}, {{TP|Serena|Pancham}}, and {{TP|Clemont|Dedenne}} come out so that they can all watch the battle as well. {{TP|Clemont|Chespin}} joins them a moment later, disappointed because it will not be participating in the Gym battle. In addition, [[Meyer]] comes to watch the Gym battle as well, much to everyone\'s surprise.\n[[File:XY067 Ash VS Clemont.png|thumb|left|250px|Ash facing Clemont]]\n[[Clembot]], acting as the referee, starts the match, and Clemont brings out {{TP|Clemont|Bunnelby}} as his first Pokémon. Ash, though momentarily surprised at Clemont\'s choice, decides to start the battle with {{AP|Pikachu}}. While Bunnelby and Pikachu are battling, Bonnie realizes that the battle is proceeding in the exact same way - the same attacks, the same responses, and the same successful hits - as [[XY001|the very first battle between Ash and Clemont]]. As Ash orders Pikachu to use {{m|Iron Tail}} and Clemont responds by having Bunnelby grab Pikachu with its ears, which is the same response he made last time, Clemont shows off Bunnelby\'s new move, {{m|Wild Charge}}, to great effect. After two {{m|Dig}} attacks, with the first one successful and the second one stopped by Iron Tail, Pikachu lands a final blow on Bunnelby and eliminates it from the match.\n\nFor his second Pokémon, Clemont chooses {{TP|Clemont|Heliolisk}}, and Ash recalls Pikachu in favor of {{AP|Goodra}}. Despite Goodra\'s powerful {{m|Dragon Pulse}} nearly hitting its mark, Heliolisk proves to be extremely agile and takes advantage of that. Goodra is helpless against Heliolisk\'s barrage of attacks, culminating in its paralysis with {{m|Thunder Wave}}. Realizing that Goodra cannot defeat Heliolisk, Ash substitutes {{AP|Hawlucha}} for it. Although Heliolisk begins to overpower Hawlucha as well with its combinations of {{m|Flash}} and {{m|Parabolic Charge}}, Ash notices that Heliolisk is momentarily vulnerable during the second it takes to open its frills. Using this to his advantage, Ash orders Hawlucha to execute a point-blank {{m|High Jump Kick}}, knocking Heliolisk out.\n\nWith Ash having all three of his Pokémon left and Clemont just one, the match is very decidedly leaning in Ash\'s favor. However, Clemont calls on {{TP|Clemont|Luxray}}, his most powerful Pokémon. After using {{m|Electric Terrain}}, Luxray easily knocks out Hawlucha with a single Wild Charge and has little trouble in taking Pikachu out of the battle as well. With only Ash\'s paralyzed Goodra left, the battle has suddenly shifted to favor Clemont instead. Immediately after calling Goodra out, Ash has it use {{m|Rain Dance}}. The Rain Dance both wipes out the Electric Terrain and, due to Goodra having the [[Ability]] {{a|Hydration}}, cures its paralysis. The two Pokémon, now on even footing, exchange attack after attack. Finally, however, Luxray falls to Goodra\'s {{m|Bide}} attack. \n\nAfter the match, Ash and Clemont thank each other for the amazing battle and Clemont rewards Ash with the {{badge|Voltage}}. Following Serena\'s suggestion, Ash sets his sights on [[Laverre City]] as the location of his sixth Gym battle. Clemont assures the group that he will continue traveling with them from this point on, and they all renew the promise they made [[XY003|at the beginning of their journey]], this time with Serena and Dedenne as well.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:Ash Voltage Badge.png|thumb|220px|Ash holding the Voltage Badge]]\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
