But while our heroes muse about various Pokémon and places, they disappear one by one—first appearing at the scenes of their musings, then reappearing back at school! They soon realize Nebby had used Teleport to take them to the places and Pokémon they were thinking about.\n\nMeanwhile, Team Rocket is determined to catch Nebby. They succeed, but thanks to Teleport, Bewear carries the trio off...and Nebby makes its way back to Ash—all by itself! After Ash and Pikachu visit the places the rest of the class saw earlier, one thing becomes obvious: Nebby is growing up!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{an|Lillie}} writes in her diary the events of the [[SM044|previous episode]]. At {{an|Professor Kukui}}\'s house, {{Ash}} provides his Pokémon with breakfast before checking on {{DL|Light trio (anime)|Solgaleo|Nebby}}. Ash and Professor Kukui head to the [[Pokémon School]] with {{AP|Rowlet}} and Nebby in Ash\'s backpack. {{TRT}} have set up their truck outside the school in an attempt to gain more customers, as [[Jessie]] finishes a call with [[Matori]]. Students pass them by but Ash runs up to the truck to buy the [[malasada]] when Team Rocket spot Nebby. Ash heads into school as [[James]] suspects Nebby is a pre-evolved form of {{p|Koffing}} which he names proto-Koffing and make plans to catch it. In the classroom, Ash and {{ashcl}} are working with clay to sculpt their partners. Their attempts start with mixed results as Nebby starts to {{m|Teleport}} them to various locations and back to the school. They soon work out what Nebby is doing as Nebby approaches Lillie only for Nebby to fall asleep. \n\nOver lunch, the class discuss what happened and realize that they were sent to somewhere they were thinking of. Ash picks Nebby up which then starts crying and they attempt to make faces to calm it down but only Lillie succeeds. Nebby suddenly teleports Ash away to a {{an|Jigglypuff}} who starts {{m|sing}}ing, putting them to sleep. Back at the school, the others head out to search for Ash when he doesn\'t return. Jigglypuff stops singing and sees Ash asleep and in turn scribbles on their faces before leaving. Waking up, Nebby starts teleporting Ash to various places before remembering Team Rocket. Down on the beach, Jessie lets out her annoyance towards Matori before discussing plans to capture Nebby. Nebby teleports Ash to their location and they announce their plans to take Nebby as Jessie brings out {{TP|Jessie|Mimikyu}}. James comes up with a plan and they agree to fight fair as James and {{MTR}} walk off with {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}}.\n\nAsh and Jessie square off against each other and a battle begins. After a few attacks, they start walking around in a circle where Ash finds himself blinded by the sun, allowing Team Rocket to capture Nebby. Team Rocket prepare themselves for the arrival of {{an|Bewear}} only for Nebby to teleport them to Bewear when Bewear doesn\'t appear. Bewear takes Team Rocket into its den. Nebby returns to Ash when it senses Ash calling to it. Nebby subsequently falls asleep as Ash is reunited with his classmates. Nebby soon wakes up and teleports everyone to the top of the school.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
