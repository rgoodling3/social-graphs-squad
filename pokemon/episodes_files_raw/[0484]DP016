It first aired in Japan on January 18, 2007, and in the United States on June 28, 2007.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/tv-episodes/season-10/episode-16-10_16-a-gruff-act-to-follow/-->\n<i>Paul has just won his badge at the Oreburgh Gym, but he\'s reluctantly persuaded to stick around and watch Ash\'s battle the next day. Ash is in the middle of strategizing for the match when he finds out that Paul gave away his Azumarill because it wasn\'t tough enough, which only makes Ash dislike Paul\'s style even more! Meanwhile, Team Rocket are touring the Oreburgh Mining Museum to get a closer look at its Fossil Restorer machine, the key to their latest criminal plot.\n\nWhen Ash\'s battle finally begins, Roark sends out Cranidos first and Ash uses Aipom to counter with speed and agility. However, Cranidos can be pretty nimble too, and it wins its round. Pikachu is up next, but Cranidos is still going strong and Pikachu just isn\'t having much of an effect. Paul gets up to leave in disgust, which gets Ash and Pikachu fired up. Roark responds by having Cranidos use its powerful Head Smash, and Ash has to bring in Turtwig to finally knock out Cranidos.\n\nRoark\'s Onix comes in and defeats Turtwig in one hit, so now it\'s all up to Pikachu. Pikachu uses Thunderbolt to break up the field so Onix can\'t maneuver as quickly, a clever strategy until Onix brings the battle to a Screech-ing halt! Not only is Ash\'s match over, but he\'s been defeated in front of his rival Paul. Now he\'s going to have to figure out a way to get back on track!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing [[Paul]]’s [[Oreburgh Gym]] victory, now {{Ash}} asks Paul to stay and watch \'\'his\'\' {{pkmn|battle}}. Paul laughs, saying it\'s funny that Ash wants him to watch Ash lose. Before a fight breaks out, both {{an|Dawn}} and {{AP|Pikachu}} break it up. Dawn tells Paul that there\'s no harm in staying and watching. Though she becomes agitated when Paul cannot remember her causing {{an|Brock}} to rush in and stop her. [[Roark]] tells Paul he\'s free to stay and watch and Paul, now mildly amused, agrees. Ash is ready to battle straight away, but Roark suggests they postpone the match till tomorrow so his Pokémon can recover, to which Ash agrees.\n\nMeanwhile, {{TRT}} are at the [[Oreburgh Mining Museum]], plotting to steal some \'cool stuff\'. Disguised as scientists, {MTR}} suggests that they figure out interesting facts about Pokémon first. As they gazed in awe at a colossal structure of coal, [[Dr. Kenzo]], who is a Pokémon {{pkmn|Professor|Researcher}}, approaches them. He is thrilled to see their enthusiasm and offers to take them on a tour of the museum. Team Rocket have their sights set on the [[Fossil]] restorer, so Dr. Kenzo escorts them to the museum’s research division. The trio are impressed by all the technology and the Fossil Pokémon housed within a special ecodome environment.\n\nMeanwhile, Paul picks up his Pokémon from the [[Pokémon Center]] where he sees Ash deciding which Pokémon he is going to use against Roark. Brock informs Ash that {{AP|Turtwig}} is the only Pokémon who has an advantage against {{t|Rock}} types. Ash agrees, so Turtwig is up. Ash also knows that {{AP|Aipom}}\'s {{m|Focus Punch}} and {{AP|Pikachu}}\'s {{m|Iron Tail}} are [[super effective]] against Rock Pokémon, so it\'s decided that Pikachu, Aipom and Turtwig will be the ones to battle. While those three are happy, {{AP|Staravia}} is extremely upset that he\'s being left out, and Ash apologises and promises he\'ll get to go up next time. {{an|Brock}} mentions to Ash that Paul\'s victory over Roark was mostly due to the speed of his Pokémon. Ash agrees, and wonders what he\'ll do during his match. Paul steps in and suggests that Ash just imitate his battel strategy. Ash outright refuses to treat his Pokémon the way Paul does. Just then, a young boy runs up to Paul, thanking him for the {{p|Azumarill}} Paul gave him. Ash realizes this is the same Azumarill that quickly lost to Roark\'s {{p|Geodude}}, and calls Paul out for discarding his Pokémon. Paul remarks that Azumarill was never going to improve. He reminds Ash that they both want to win, but Ash replies that he is prepared to train his team to perform. With that, Paul leaves and Ash vows never to lose to him again.\n\nThe following day arrives, and Ash heads straight for the Oreburgh Gym to take on Roark. After the rules are stated, Ash is sure that he will show Paul some \'real battling\'. Roark first sends out his {{TP|Roark|Cranidos}}, surprising Ash who expected to face Cranidos last. Ash decides to start things off with Aipom, hoping to win using her speed. {{si|Ian}} calls for the match to begin, and Ash commands Aipom to use {{m|Focus Punch}}. However, Cranidos leaps high into the air and knocks Aipom to the ground with a {{m|Headbutt}}. After Aipom hits the ground, Roark has Cranidos use {{m|Flamethrower}}. Ash is able to keep Aipom out of harm\'s way with {{m|Double Team}}. However Cranidos easily gets rid of all the Aipom illusions, so Ash decides to go on the attack with {{m|Swift}} sending Cranidos reeling back. Ash now has Aipom try another Focus Punch, so Roark has Cranidos counter with {{m|Zen Headbutt}}. Both attacks collide, causing a massive explosion. However Aipom comes out of it the worst, as she flies into Ash\'s arms [[fainting|unable to battle]]. Ash [[recall]]s Aipom for some rest and decides to use Pikachu next. \n\nRight off the bat, Ash has Pikachu to use {{m|Thunderbolt}} and Roark commands Cranidos to dodge and use Zen Headbutt. Although Cranidos successfully avoids the Thunderbolt, Pikachu strikes back with Iron Tail, sending Cranidos backwards and demolishing one of the rocks on the Gym floor. Ash believes that should finish Cranidos off, however it surprises him by quickly getting back to its feet and using Headbutt. Pikachu tries to dodge and use Thunderbolt by jumping into the air but Cranidos jumps as well, hitting Pikachu and canceling out the attack. Pikachu tries to use Thunderbolt again but is thwarted by Cranidos\' Zen Headbutt. Again, Cranidos uses Headbutt on Pikachu, knocking him to the ground. \n\nUnimpressed, Paul gets up to leave believing Ash has already lost. However, Pikachu suddenly shows his fighting spirit by letting off a powerful electric attack in the air, making Paul regain interest. Ash tells Pikachu to use {{m|Quick Attack}} while Cranidos is told to counter with Flamethrower. However, Pikachu dodges it and successfully lands Iron Tail on Cranidos\' head. Amazingly, despite all of the damage, Cranidos manages to recover. Roark orders a {{m|Head Smash}}, so Ash takes his chance with {{m|Volt Tackle}} despite the risk of [[recoil]]. The two scream towards each other full of power and collide, causing a massive explosion and injuring both Pokémon.\n\nAsh decides that Pikachu needs to be recalled for now and sends out Turtwig. Ash begins with {{m|Razor Leaf}}, though Cranidos’s Flamethrower scorches through the leaves. Turtwig however is quick enough to dodge the Flamethrower and uses {{m|Bite}} on Cranidos\' arm. Cranidos then uses Zen Headbutt, and scores a direct hit sending Turtwig flying. Cranidos scores another direct hit on Turtwig with Flamethrower, causing major damage. Turtwig makes a quick recover and sends out a Razor Leaf, scoring a knock out on Cranidos. Ash is thrilled with Turtwig’s efforts, but doesn\'t allow himself to celebrate knowing that he went through far too much to knock out only one Pokémon.\n\nRoark sends out {{p|Onix}} as his second Pokémon, while Ash keeps Turtwig in. Turtwig attacks with Razor Leaf, but Onix is speedy enough to dodge. Onix follows up with {{m|Double-Edge}} which scores a direct hit on Turtwig and knocks it out, having suffered massive damage already from Cranidos\'s Flamethrower. \n\nAsh sends out Pikachu again, but Pikachu is already exhausted and damaged from the round against Cranidos. Onix uses {{m|Slam}}, countering Pikachu\'s Iron Tail, and the resulting exchange damages both sides. Ash is struggling, knowing that the only move that\'s any good against Onix is Iron Tail then suddenly gets a flash of inspiration and tells Pikachu to use Thunderbolt on the field. Onix attempts a Double-Edge, however the debris from Pikachu\'s attack keeps it at bay. Ash calls for a Quick Attack, but a {{m|Screech}} from Onix halts his advance. The decibels knock Pikachu into one of the field’s jagged stones, knocking him out. Ian declares Pikachu as unable to battle, therefore the match is over with Roark the winner, meaning no [[Badge]] for Ash. As Ash picks up his exhausted partner, Paul leaves but not before making it known that his opinion of Ash is as low as ever.\n\n==Major events==\n* [[Paul]] gives his {{p|Azumarill}} to a young boy.\n* {{Ash}} battles [[Roark]] in his first [[Sinnoh]] [[Gym]] match and loses.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* [[Dr. Kenzo]]\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{an|Giovanni}} ([[Boss fantasy|fantasy]])\n* [[Paul]]\n* [[Roark]]\n* {{si|Ian}} \n* [[Dr. Kenzo]] \n* Boy \n* Researcher\n* Tourist\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Aipom}} ({{OP|Ash|Aipom}})\n* {{p|Staravia}} ({{OP|Ash|Staravia}})\n* {{p|Turtwig}} ({{OP|Ash|Turtwig}})\n* {{p|Chansey}} ({{OP|Nurse Joy|Chansey}})\n* {{p|Onix}} ([[Roark]]\'s)\n* {{p|Cranidos}} ({{OP|Roark|Cranidos}})\n* {{p|Omanyte}}\n* {{p|Armaldo}}\n* {{p|Aerodactyl}} (fantasy)\n* {{p|Kabutops}} (fantasy)\n* {{p|Cradily}} (fantasy)\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[Professor Oak\'s Big Pokémon Encyclopedia]]: [[Ash\'s Turtwig]]\n* Pokémon senryū: ナエトルは\u3000あたまにはっぱ\u3000はえとるぞ \'\'Naetoru wa, atama ni happa, haetoru zo\'\' "{{tt|Naetle|Turtwig}}, the leaf on its head is growing."\n* Music from \'\'[[M06|Jirachi: Wish Maker]]\'\', \'\'[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]\'\', and \'\'[[M08|Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]\'\' are used as background music.\n* [[Jessie]], [[James]], {{MTR}}, and {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} narrate the preview for [[DP017|the next episode]].\n* {{TRT}} doesn\'t blast off in this episode.\n* This is the first time {{Ash}} has lost to the first [[Gym Leader]] of a [[region]] since he faced {{an|Brock}} in \'\'[[EP005|Showdown in Pewter City]]\'\'.\n** This is also the first time that Ash has lost to a Gym Leader that doesn\'t use all of their Pokémon since facing Brock.
