It was first broadcast in Japan on November 4, 2004 and in the United States on November 12, 2005.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/08_09-vanity-affair/-->\n<i>Ash is battling with another Trainer by the waterfront, not realizing he is being watched by a mysterious sailor. After he wins, Ash is confident and boastful. The kids decide to grab something to eat.\n\nTeam Rocket is currently working in a small restaurant, when the old sailor walks in and demands some hot milk. While he is there, Ash and friends sit down outside and talk about battling. The man approaches them, and Max recognizes him as Drake of the Elite Four!\n\nDrake invites all of them (including the disguised Team Rocket) to his boat, where he challenges Ash to a battle. Drake sends out his Shelgon, and though it is slower, it waits for Pikachu to get just close enough to take it down with Dragonbreath and Dragon Claw.\n\nAsh calls out Grovyle against Drake\'s Altaria, and though Grovyle has a better time leaping on the masts of the ship, it gets knocked out by some powerful moves from Altaria, including Aerial Ace and Solar Beam.\n\nTeam Rocket takes advantage of a weakened Pikachu to steal it, but Drake calls out his Salamence. It uses Dragon Claw and Flamethrower to send the thieves blasting off. With Team Rocket thwarted and a few lessons learned, Ash and friends have dinner with Drake and his crew on the boat.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} takes on another {{pkmn|Trainer}} and his {{p|Scizor}} while [[Drake]] watches on from afar. Scizor goes for a {{m|Fury Cutter}}, but {{AP|Torkoal}} uses {{m|Flamethrower}}, forcing Scizor to dodge it and stop its attack. Scizor responds with a {{m|Hyper Beam}}, but Torkoal {{m|Iron Defense|tucks itself into its shell}}, negating the effects of the attack. As Torkoal emerges from its shell unharmed, Scizor\'s charges in with {{m|Metal Claw}}. Torkoal responds with {{m|Overheat}} to win the match. Afterwards, Ash and {{ashfr}} decide to relax at a local restarant, unaware that {{TRT}} are working there to make money to fund their schemes. [[James]] approaches to get the customer\'s orders, though is startled to see the [[twerp]]s. He rushes back into the kitchen to alert his teammates to the twerps\' arrival, so they consider kidnapping {{AP|Pikachu}}. However, they decide to bide theit time for now after imagining the rather intimidating Drake, who is also a customer, blasting them off with a massive punch. While enjoying his hot cup of peppermint milk, Drake also notices the group through a window and approaches them. As {{an|May}} discusses strategy for her next {{pkmn|Contest}}, Drake advises the young {{pkmn|Coordinator}} that her choice of {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} is very important. May is startled by the man and [[Max]] suddenly recognizes Drake as a member of the [[Elite Four]], surprising the group and impressing Team Rocket. Drake compliments Ash on his earlier battle. He promptly invites the group aboard his boat, as well as the waiters, Jessie and James, for the great glass of peppermint milk. \n\nDrake escorts everyone to the docks as his grand ship sails into view. Once aboard, everyone marvels over the ship\'s grandeur. Max then asks Drake to show them his Pokémon, and Ash eagerly joins in. Drake instead suggests a battle with Ash, and the young Trainer agrees almost immediately. {{an|Brock}} cautions Ash given his earlier over-confidence, but Ash is certain that he\'ll win. Meanwhile, Team Rocket realize that this may be their chance to nab Pikachu. The first round of the three-on-three match begins with Drake choosing {{p|Shelgon}} while Ash selects Pikachu. Ash seems confident, thinking that Pikachu\'s {{stat|Speed}} will give it the advantage. Pikachu starts off by using {{m|Thunderbolt}}, and it hits Shelgon directly. However, Drake seems calm. Pikachu repeats the attack, but this time Shelgon dodges it, although barely, with {{m|Double-Edge}}. Shelgon keeps charging at Pikachu, but he is easily able to avoid it with a {{m|Quick Attack}}. Believing that he has Shelgon all tired out, Ash tells Pikachu to use {{m|Iron Tail}}. Drake doesn\'t seem to react until Pikachu is in range before having Shelgon counter with {{m|Dragon Breath}} and follow up with {{m|Dragon Claw}}. The two attacks prove to be too much for Pikachu, and the little Pokémon faints. Ash retrieves Pikachu from the field as Brock comments favorably on Drake\'s strength in battle. Drake’s first mate, [[Fitzwilliam]], admits that Shelgon\'s incredible endurance was key to Drake\'s strategy.\n\nDrake brings out {{p|Altaria}}, and Ash responds with {{AP|Grovyle}}. Max is worried because a {{type|Grass}} is weak against a {{type|Flying}}, but Ash seems to have a plan. As Fitzwilliam predicted, Ash has Grovyle jump from mast to mast, allowing it to reach the Flying Pokémon. It then uses {{m|Bullet Seed}}, but Altaria flies behind one of the masts to evade the onslaught. Grovyle prepares to lash its opponent with a {{m|Leaf Blade}}, but Altaria is nowhere to be seen. Suddenly, it appears from behind with a {{m|Take Down}} attack. With its opponent starting to wear out, Altaria then uses Dragon Breath, knocking Grovyle to the ground. Drake advises Ash that he needs to fully focus on the battle if he hopes to win. Altaria then charges downward with a {{m|Sky Attack}}, but Grovyle is able to dodge it with Quick Attack, before throwing out a Leaf Blade at its opponent. However, Altaria dodges the attack with {{m|Aerial Ace}} and fires a {{m|Solar Beam}}, which sends Grovyle crashing through two barrels before slamming into a wall and knocking itself out. Drake gently picks up Grovyle, and after a quick inspection admits that some rest at the [[Pokémon Center]] will help it recover. Ash agrees and [[recall]]s Grovyle. Drake commends Ash on his improved abilities, admitting that maintaining a clear mind will help him go far.\n\nDrake invites everyone to have dinner on his ship after Ash\'s Pokémon have been treated at the Pokémon Center, and everyone happily accepts. Off to the side, Team Rocket put their latest Pikachu-nabbing scheme into motion. They distract May, who is holding the now-conscious Pikachu, with a drink. As May tries to take it, Jessie quickly snatches Pikachu from her hands, and Team Rocket jumps into their waiting [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|balloon]]. The trio recites their {{motto}} as they remove their [[List of Team Rocket\'s disguises|waiter uniforms]]. Drake wastes no time in calling out his {{p|Salamence}}, which uses a Dragon Claw on the balloon\'s basket, causing the balloon to shake violently. This, in turn, causes Jessie to drop Pikachu and Salamence swoops in to save the little Pokémon. With Pikachu riding on its back, Salamence unleashes a Flamethrower attack on the balloon, sending Team Rocket blasting off. May checks her [[Pokédex]] for information about Salamence, while Ash, watching Drake\'s Pokémon in action, comments that this must be the true power of the Elite Four. \n\nThat night, the group join Drake and crew for a hearty dinner. Drake tells Ash that he shouldn\'t focus so much on winning, but should always seek stronger and stronger opponents, having suffered from overly large self-confidence in the past as well. Ash nods at this advice, having learned a lesson in humility, and is now ready for his next adventure.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} meet [[Drake]], a member of the [[Hoenn]] [[Elite Four]].\n* Ash has a {{pkmn|battle}} with Drake and loses.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* [[Drake]]\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Drake]]\n* Drake\'s crew members\n** [[Fitzwilliam]]\n* {{pkmn|Trainer}}\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:PTC AG101.png|thumb|200px|Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]\n[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]: {{p|Wingull}}\n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Chimecho}} ({{OP|James|Chimecho}})\n* {{p|Grovyle}} ({{OP|Ash|Grovyle}})\n* {{p|Torkoal}} ({{OP|Ash|Torkoal}})\n* {{p|Shelgon}} ([[Drake]]\'s)\n* {{p|Altaria}} ([[Drake]]\'s)\n* {{p|Salamence}} ([[Drake]]\'s)\n* {{p|Scizor}} ({{pkmn|Trainer}}\'s)\n* {{p|Wingull}} (multiple)\n\n==Trivia==\n* This episode was initially intended to be the 102nd episode of the {{series|Advanced Generation}}, and the 376th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]] overall, but it was moved up in the schedule due to {{wp|2004 Chūetsu earthquake|strong earthquakes}} occurring in Niigata Prefecture nearly a week before the airing of [[AG100]].\n* The title is a pun on the fashion magazine "\'\'{{wp|Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair}}\'\'".\n* This episode marks the only time a member of the [[Hoenn]] [[Elite Four]] appears in the anime.\n* This is the first episode that makes a running change in an English dub opening. From this point, [[Unbeatable]] replaces the {{p|Mew}} and {{p|Lucario}} scene with [[AG100|Pikachu using Iron Tail]], and edits out {{p|Mime Jr.}} and {{p|Weavile}} from the Team Rocket scene. This is due to the fact that Lucario, Mime Jr., and Weavile had not yet been revealed to American audiences.\n* {{p|Altaria}} is shown using five moves during its battle against {{AP|Grovyle}}, instead of only four. \n* This episode shares several notable similarities with \'\'[[EP099|The Mandarin Island Miss Match]]\'\': {{Ash}} gets overconfident after winning multiple straight {{pkmn|battle}}s, {{ashfr|the group}} meets an Elite Four member whom Ash battles and loses to, and said Elite Four member teaches Ash a lesson in humility.\n** Both of these episodes were storyboarded by Yoshitaka Fujimoto.\n\n===Errors===\n* After {{p|Scizor}} has dodged {{AP|Torkoal}}\'s {{m|Flamethrower}}, it lands for a second and jumps for more speed. However, when it leaves the screen, its foot gets stuck on the corner of the screen, even though {{an|Brock}}, [[Max]], and {{an|May}}\'s faces can be seen moving after this, clearly following Scizor.\n\n===Dub edits===\n====[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]====\n* Question: Trainers, which Pokémon is Pikachu most effective against?\n* Choices: {{p|Torkoal}}, {{p|Wingull}}, {{p|Manectric}}\n* Answer: Okay, Trainers!
