It first aired in Japan on May 21, 2015 and in the United States on July 25, 2015.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/18_25-a-fashionable-battle/-->\n<i>When our heroes arrive in Laverre City, Serena tells Ash that Gym Leader Valerie is also a renowned fashion designer. Unfortunately for Ash and another would-be challenger named Sawyer, this means the Gym is closed for a fashion show and there are no battles to be found! Ash and Sawyer decide to have a battle of their own. Meanwhile, Serena and Bonnie admire Valerie\'s lovely designs...and then get recruited to join the fashion show as substitute models!\n\nOur heroes soon learn that at the end of every fashion show, Valerie chooses a challenger from the audience so she can show off how her creations look in battle. This time, it’s Sawyer’s turn! His Bagon has no chance against Valerie\'s Spritzee, but he appreciates the experience and takes lots of notes for next time.\n\nAsh is so excited for his Gym battle the next day that he can barely wait to finish dinner before launching right into some special training with Sawyer’s help. Ash isn’t the only eager one—Serena, Clemont, and Bonnie rush through their own meals to cheer them on!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} finally arrive in [[Laverre City]], and Ash is barely able to contain his excitement about his Gym match. {{an|Serena}} is excited as well, albeit for a slightly different reason—she wants to meet [[Valerie]], a famous fashion designer who happens to be the Laverre [[Gym Leader]] as well. The group heads over to the Laverre Gym, but when they enter, they see a large number of girls wearing Valerie\'s costumes running around and getting ready for something. Suddenly, Ash sees a young boy talking to a lady behind a desk and begging for a Gym match, but his request is refused due to an event scheduled for later that day. Ash bursts into the conversation as well, which confirms his fears of not being able to have his Gym match just yet.\n\nAfter {{an|Bonnie}} asks the woman to marry {{an|Clemont}}, and Clemont pulls her away with much embarrassment, the boy next to Ash, whose name is [[Sawyer]], suddenly notices Clemont and recognizes him as the [[Lumiose City|Lumiose]] Gym Leader from [[XY064|his previous Gym challenge]]. Sawyer introduces himself to the group and explains how he knows Clemont. After being asked why he is away from the [[Lumiose Gym]], Clemont tells Sawyer how he is traveling with Ash and the others to gain some more experience, just like Sawyer is doing with his Gym challenges. Upon hearing that Ash has five [[Badge]]s already, including the Voltage Badge, Sawyer is amazed and decides to work even harder to catch up. Serena then suggests that they go to the store, to which Ash agrees.\n\nWhile Serena, Bonnie, {{TP|Clemont|Dedenne}}, and {{TP|Serena|Braixen}} are busy admiring the many different fashion designs, Ash asks Sawyer for a battle. Sawyer requests a [[Double Battle]], and Ash agrees, and Clemont follows them to act as the referee. Ash sends out {{AP|Hawlucha}} and {{AP|Frogadier}}, while Sawyer chooses his {{TP|Sawyer|Treecko}} and {{p|Bagon}}. Sawyer uses Bagon\'s hard head to great effect, but Hawlucha counters with repeated {{m|Karate Chop}}s to wear down Bagon\'s endurance. Although a combination of {{m|Leech Seed}} and {{m|Fire Fang}} nearly makes contact with Hawlucha, Frogadier intervenes at the last minute with {{m|Water Pulse}}, allowing Hawlucha to escape. Sawyer then compliments Ash on the teamwork with his Pokémon. Frogadier then successfully dodges two {{m|Bullet Seed}} attacks and counters the third with {{m|Cut}}, taking Treecko out of the match. Meanwhile, Serena and Bonnie are approached by two girls, who ask for their help with something, and as Ash and Sawyer are about to continue their battle, it is interrupted by their noticing the start of a fashion show.\n\nThe two girls take Serena and Bonnie to meet Valerie, who looks them over and agrees that they will do nicely, but without explaining anything. Serena is overcome with joy at finally meeting Valerie, but Bonnie quickly asks her to take care of Clemont as well, but Serena chides her for it. Valerie then explains that she needs a favor from the two of them. Outside, Ash, Clemont, and Sawyer are next to the large runway that has been set up, still trying to figure out what is going on. As the fashion show starts, several dresses designed after Pokémon are modeled, including designs of an {{p|Azumarill}}, [[gender|female]] {{p|Meowstic}}, {{p|Gothorita}}, and {{p|Chimecho}}. Suddenly, Serena and Bonnie appear with Braixen and Dedenne, modeling dresses designed after {{p|Florges}} and {{p|Chingling}}. Once Clemont and Ash get over their shock of seeing the two girls on the stage, Serena explains that the real models could not come and so Valerie needed two substitutes and chose them.\n\nSuddenly, Valerie herself appears, explaining to the crowd how she used Pokémon as the basis for all of her designs. Following the advice of the girl who denied Sawyer and Ash Gym challenges earlier that day, Valerie calls Sawyer onto the stage and challenges him to a battle—with the usual Gym rules in place. With the battle being a one-on-one match, Sawyer calls on his Bagon and Valerie her {{p|Spritzee}}. Bagon starts off with a {{m|Dragon Breath}} attack, but it fails due to Spritzee being a {{type|Fairy}} Pokémon. Sawyer then attempts to use back-to-back {{m|Headbutt}} attacks, just like Hawlucha did earlier, but his efforts again fail due to Spritzee\'s ability to move freely in the air. The battle is soon over with a single {{m|Dazzling Gleam}} attack from Spritzee, and Sawyer does not earn the Fairy Badge.\n\nLater that evening, the group has a meal at the [[Pokémon Center]], with Ash excitedly anticipating his upcoming Gym battle against Valerie. He and Sawyer head outside to train, followed by the other three once they finish eating.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:XY073 Ash VS Sawyer.png|thumb|220px|Ash facing Sawyer]]\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
