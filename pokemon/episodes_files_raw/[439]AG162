It was first broadcast in Japan on February 2, 2006 and in the United States on November 4, 2006.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/09_17-spontaneous-combusken/-->\n<i>May is about to enter her next Contest on Chrysanthemum Island. Drew is there too, but not only is he not competing, he didn\'t send her the mysterious note she received in Wisteria Town. During a practice battle between Munchlax and Combusken, May meets Brianna, the real sender of the note. Though she rooted for May in Wisteria Town, she\'s really a huge Drew fan. May introduces her to Drew, which only makes Brianna determined to beat May and earn Drew\'s respect.\n\nThe Contest begins! Jessie teams up with James\' Mime Jr. to perform a hula dance, May and Munchlax take the stage with a risky use of Metronome, and Brianna and her Surskit puts on an amazing ice show. All three will move on, but before the second round starts, Brianna wants to know if May likes Drew! Well, May\'s not so sure about that. Jessie battles May in the second round, and James is horrified to watch Combusken defeat Mime Jr. with a mighty Sky Uppercut.\n\nNow it\'s Brianna and May in the final round, and Brianna\'s brought her Vibrava. Vibrava comes on strong, using Sand Tomb to trap Combusken. All looks lost but Combusken learns Mega Kick, just in time to free itself and then knock Vibrava out! Afterward, as Brianna congratulates May, Drew compliments Brianna and sends her into a swoon. May is sure to see Drew and his smooth moves again, but first, it\'s on to the Battle Palace!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} have arrived on the getaway destination [[Chrysanthemum Island]] for {{an|May}}’s next [[Pokémon Contest]]. Outside the [[Contest Hall]], the registered {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s are preparing their prized {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} while Ash tries to hone {{AP|Sceptile}}\'s skills following its [[AG161|heartbreak]]. Sceptile tries to use {{m|Bullet Seed}}, but it only manages to create a small plume of smoke. Ash calls for Sceptile to try again, when [[Drew]] confronts him, adding that he is only making Sceptile more stressed. May asks her rival about the letter she received back in [[Wisteria Town]], though Drew replies that he didn’t send the letter. He explains that he isn’t even going to be competing in this Contest, and he instead travelled to Chrysanthemum Island to rest up. The admission leaves May curious as to who actually wrote her the latter.\n\nMeanwhile, {{TRT}} is by the beach with [[Jessie]] dressed in her Contest attire as she plans to use {{TP|James|Mime Jr.}} in the upcoming Contest. In the distance, May begins to work on {{TP|May|Munchlax}} and {{TP|May|Combusken}}\'s skills. Munchlax quickly lunges towards Combusken with a {{m|Focus Punch}}, but misses and continues on to nearly hit a bystander and crash into the soft sand. As everyone tries to remove Munchlax from the sand, May goes to apologize for its actions. [[Brianna]] is pleasantly surprised to see her idol May in-person, adding that she was the one who sent her the letter. She then tries to hand May a solitary rose, Munchlax jumps forward and snatches it from her hand, devouring it in one bite. After learning that Brianna is a fan of Drew’s as well, she takes her to a nearby hotel pool to meet him. After a few quick words, the two shake hands and Drew wishes Brianna luck in the Contest. When Drew is finally out of sight, Brianna displays her affection for Drew. Her attitude turns from lovestruck meekness to fiery determination as she tells May that she wants Drew\'s respect and the quickest way she\'ll get it is by beating May in this Contest.\n\nThe spotlight shines on [[Lilian Meridian|Lilian]] as she begins [[Contest announcer|announcing]] the Contest. The [[Appeal|Appeals Round]] begins and the first contestant is Jessie with her magnificent Mime Jr. dressed in {{wp|Hawaii}}an attire. When Mime Jr. is sent out from its {{i|Poké Ball}}, it rotates on its upper head while Jessie performs a small hula dance. The crowd roars for Jessie\'s performance. Next, May and her Munchlax take to the stage. May quickly directs Munchlax to unleash its {{m|Solar Beam}}, filling the stadium with a magnificent blend of lights and colors. Munchlax\'s next move is {{m|Metronome}}, so it begins moving its hands in synchronization. However, the move backfires and Munchlax is put to sleep, having used the move {{m|Rest}}. After a few moments of hesitation, May throws a [[Pokéblock]] into the air. Munchlax instantly awakens and devours the Pokéblock in mid-air while rotating. On its descent, Munchlax comes down with a {{m|Focus Punch}}, gracefully landing on the stadium platform. The third contestant is Brianna, with her {{p|Surskit}}. Surskit uses {{m|Ice Beam}} on the stage, allowing it to gracefully pirouette like an ice skater across the now frozen performance stage. It finishes the performance with a high-velocity spin. The crowd cheers for Surskit\'s performance as the [[Contest Judge]]s give approval of Brianna\'s performance.\n\nThe other contestants include {{p|Hoothoot}}, {{p|Hypno}}, {{p|Blastoise}}, and {{p|Castform}}. With the first round of competition ending, the results are revealed and among the contestants are May, Brianna, and Jessie. The match-ups are then announced, with May to face Jessie in the first round of the tournament.\n\nThe stage is set with May and her Combusken facing off against Jessie and her Mime Jr. Combusken begins the battle with a {{m|Fire Spin}}, but Mime Jr. easily dodges and uses {{m|Mimic}}, sending an identical Fire Spin to Combusken. The tricky move deducts more points than usual from May\'s score. Combusken recomposes itself and rushes toward Mime Jr with {{m|Quick Attack}}, and they both clash. Mime Jr. maneuvers itself in mid-air to begin "{{m|Tickle|tickling}}" Combusken, reducing a substantial amount of points from May. Mime Jr. follows up with another Mimicked Fire Spin, but as the flames engulf Combusken, it recovers and gains power. Combusken leaps through the ongoing Fire Spin and knocks Mime Jr. with a {{m|Sky Uppercut}} to win the round.\n\nAfter clearing through their other battles, May and Brianna find themselves against one another in the finals. The crowd cheers as the final battle is started. May calls upon her Combusken while Brianna releases her {{p|Vibrava}}. As Combusken moves in for the attack, Vibrava uses its {{m|Screech}} attack, causing Combusken to cover its ears. As Vibrava continues with its Screech attack, Combusken launches a Fire spin for a direct hit. Vibrava retaliates with its {{m|Dragon Breath}} attack, nullifying the Fire Spin. Vibrava then uses its {{m|Sand Tomb}} attack to entrap Combusken\'s legs in a mound of sand. Combusken struggles, but is unable to remove itself from the tomb. Suddenly, Combusken\'s feathers begin to glow a faint blue. After a moment, Combusken bursts from the Sand Tomb using its new move, {{m|Mega Kick}}. Vibrava doesn\'t let up, unleashing another Dragon Breath attack and hitting Combusken for great damage, reducing May\'s points further. Combusken ascends into the air for a {{m|Sky Uppercut}}, but misses its target as Vibrava goes for another Sand Tomb attack. Combusken disperses the sand once more and descends down with a hard {{m|Mega Kick}} on Vibrava. The two Pokémon crash into the ground, and Vibrava is declared unable to battle. With this victory over Brianna, the Chrysanthemum Contest draws to a close and [[Raoul Contesta|Mr. Contesta]] presents May with the Chrysanthemum [[Ribbon]]; her third overall.\n\nAs the sun is setting, May and Brianna reflect upon their Contest performances. May\'s friends join them on the beach, including Drew, who causes Brianna to blush and hide behind May. Drew acknowledges both of their good efforts and wishes Brianna luck, causing her to suddenly faint from swooning. Drew reminds May that she only has two Ribbons left until the [[Grand Festival]]. As he walks off into the distance, May watches him and begins to blush.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:May Chrysanthemum Ribbon.png|thumb|220px|May holding the Chrysanthemum Ribbon]]\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrive in [[Chrysanthemum Island]] and meet up with [[Drew]] again.\n* It is revealed that May\'s [[AG160|invitation]] was sent by [[Brianna]] rather than Drew.\n* [[James\'s Mime Jr.]] is revealed to know {{m|Mimic}} and {{m|Tickle}}.\n* [[May\'s Combusken]] learns {{m|Mega Kick}}.\n* May enters the Chrysanthemum {{pkmn|Contest}} and wins, earning her third [[Kanto]] [[Ribbon]].\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* [[Brianna]]\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* [[Drew]]\n* [[Lilian Meridian]]\n* [[Raoul Contesta]]\n* [[Mr. Sukizo]]\n* [[Brianna]] \n* {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s\n* {{pkmn|Trainer}}s\n* Audience\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Mime Jr.}} ({{OP|James|Mime Jr.}})\n* {{p|Sceptile}} ({{OP|Ash|Sceptile}})\n* {{p|Combusken}} ({{OP|May|Combusken}})\n* {{p|Munchlax}} ({{OP|May|Munchlax}})\n* {{p|Roselia}} ({{OP|Drew|Roselia}})\n* {{p|Vibrava}} ([[Brianna]]\'s) \n* {{p|Surskit}} ([[Brianna]]\'s)\n* {{p|Castform}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Hoothoot}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Gardevoir}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Skarmory}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Nidorina}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Blastoise}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Hypno}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Makuhita}} (Trainer\'s)\n* {{p|Breloom}} (Trainer\'s)\n* {{p|Psyduck}} (Trainer\'s)\n* {{p|Machop}}\n* {{p|Meditite}}\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:Frontier Ash Lineup 3.png|thumb|205px|Ash\'s Sceptile in the opening]]\n* [[Ash\'s Sceptile]] was added to the {{so|Battle Frontier|opening}} credits.\n* The English and Spanish titles refer to {{wp|spontaneous combustion}}, which is a sudden ignition or explosion.\n* In the Japanese version of this episode, [[Drew\'s Roselia]]\'s voice was supplied by a different, uncredited voice actor due to the absence of its regular actress, [[Ikue Ohtani]], because it didn\'t have as much stock audio as [[Ash\'s Pikachu]].\n* [[Sarah Natochenny]] becomes the English voice actress for [[Drew\'s Roselia]] as of this episode, as it is its first appearance since the voice acting switch.\n* {{TRT}} neither blasts off nor recites their {{motto}} in this episode.\n\n===Errors===\n* {{TP|May|Combusken}} was misspelled as \'\'Combuskin\'\' on the dub\'s title card. This was later corrected, though the error remained on the DVD version, foreign language dubs and when it re-aired several other times.\n* After {{an|May}} beats [[Jessie]] in the battle round, [[Lilian Meridian|Lilian]] says, "...and May moves on to the final round!" May actually had to defeat one more opponent before moving on to the final round against [[Brianna]].\n* After Combusken uses {{m|Fire Spin}} on {{p|Vibrava}}, {{an|Brock}} mentions that {{type|Fire}} moves wouldn\'t be strong against {{type|Ground}} Pokémon. This is a mistake because Vibrava resists Fire due to its other type, {{t|Dragon}}. The Ground type itself does not resist Fire-type moves.\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=77FF77|bordercolor=55DD55\n|zh_cmn={{tt|神奇寶貝華麗大賽！讓葉大會！|Pokémon Contest!
