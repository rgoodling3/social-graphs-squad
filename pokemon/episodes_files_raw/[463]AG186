(Japanese: '''バトルピラミッド再び！VSレジスチル！！''' ''Battle Pyramid Again! VS Registeel!!'') is the 186th episode of the {{series|Advanced Generation}}, and the 460th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on August 3, 2006 and in the United States on January 20, 2007.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/09_41-overjoyed/-->\n<i>Ash has reached Fennel Valley at last, where he plans to challenge Brandon to an official battle—but Brandon won't be back until tomorrow! Instead, our hero is welcomed by an enthusiastic Nurse Joy. This Nurse Joy loves Pokémon battles and Contests, and she even offers to help Ash train. Her Chansey may look sweet, but once its nurse's hat comes off, so do the gloves! Chansey quickly outpowers Ash's Corphish, teaching Ash a lesson about battle strategy that doesn't make him too happy.\n\nLater, Ash goes out to visit Brandon, who is still busy searching for a very rare Pokémon. Brandon tells Ash that he intends to use Registeel in their official battle, so Ash decides to call in some help from back home. When the battle starts the next day, Ash unveils his secret weapon: his old friend Torkoal!\n\nAsh intends to counter Brandon's Registeel with Torkoal's Fire-type advantage and its latest move, Heat Wave! However, it takes more than just a new move to stop Brandon's Registeel. Even though Ash uses his usual creative strategies, Brandon's Registeel wins the day with its devastating Zap Cannon attacks and the Lock-On move that makes sure it doesn't miss! Refusing to give up, Ash promises to battle Brandon again. But after two losses to the Pyramid King, can he figure out a winning strategy and complete this final Battle Frontier challenge?</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} have finally arrived at [[Fennel Valley]], the new location of the [[Battle Pyramid]]. Ash is psyched up for his battle against {{FB|Pyramid King|Brandon}} and determined to be crowned the {{pkmn|Champion}} of the {{Gdis|Battle Frontier|III}}.\n\nAs they approach the Battle Pyramid, they find [[Scott]] waiting for them with [[Nurse Joy]]. Joy is excited to see Ash and runs up to him like a crazed fan, asking him to sign the photo album she has containing pictures from all his major battles. Scott explains that this Nurse Joy is a huge fan of [[Pokémon battle]]s and [[Pokémon Contest]]s, as she gets out another album dedicated to {{an|May}} which she asks her to sign. {{an|Brock}} is slightly annoyed at this and tries to get Nurse Joy's attention but is pulled away by [[Max]].\n\nScott explains to Ash that {{FB|Pyramid King|Brandon}} is currently busy at the ruins and can't battle yet, leaving Ash disappointed. Nurse Joy says that her [[Pokémon Center]] is nearby and they can all go there to rest before Brandon gets back. When they get there, Nurse Joy shows the gang around all the facilities that the Pokémon Center has, including an exercise room, a Contest Hall, hot springs, as well as a battle field.\n\nIn preparation for his official battle with Brandon, Ash asks May to battle him as a warm up. However, May is desperate to try out the hot springs so Nurse Joy offers to battle him instead. Nurse Joy removes her Nurse's hat which causes her to have a change in persona. Meanwhile, {{TRT}}, who are exhausted from following Ash and his friends, are now arguing about which way they should have gone. {{MTR}} hears something and they crouch behind a bush to see Ash and Joy squaring off for their battle. As Brock says that he'll act as the referee, {{TP|Nurse Joy|Chansey}} removes her nurse's hat, causing her to have a similar change in persona to Joy.\n\nMay remarks at how differently the two of them are acting as Ash sends out {{AP|Corphish}}. Ash tells Corphish to use {{m|Crabhammer}} and the attack hits Chansey on the head, but Max notices that is doesn't seem to have had much effect. Joy then has Chansey use {{m|Double Slap}}, the attack hits and causes much more damage than Corphish's attack did. As Joy is enjoying the thrill of battle, Ash tells Corphish to use {{m|Vice Grip}}, but Joy counters by having Chansey use {{m|Dynamic Punch}}. The attack knocks Corphish back and Ash tells it to use {{m|Bubble Beam}}, but Chansey stands her ground. Joy then has Chansey use {{m|Double-Edge}} and it slams into Corphish, knocking it to the ground. Corphish hangs in there and Ash has it use Crabhammer again, and Joy has Chansey charge up a {{m|Solar Beam}}. Corphish manages to lands multiple Crabhammers but Chansey fires the attack, which send Corphish flying and [[fainting|knocking it out]].\n\nJoy makes a sort of victory speech before she and Chansey return each other's Nurse hats, removing their battle personas, and rushing off with Corphish on a stretcher. As the gang comment on how different this Nurse Joy is from all the others, {{TRT}} decide to steal Chansey with Meowth having another one of his [[Boss fantasy|wild fantasies]] of how they will impress {{an|Giovanni}}.\n\nBack at the Pokémon Center, May and Max are wondering what Ash will do in his battle with Brandon after mentioning how he lost to him last time. May says that his battle with Chansey proves that you can't match power with power. As Brock says he needs to try to turn this defeat into something positive, Nurse Joy comes out and says Corphish will be fine by tomorrow.\n\nJust then, Chansey spots what looks like a {{p|Blissey}}, but is actually {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} in [[List of Team Rocket's disguises|disguise]]. Chansey goes to investigate and is attacked by Team Rocket who tie her up and run off. As they make their getaway, they wonder why Chansey doesn't fight back. As they continue to run, the wind knocks her Nurses' hat off which lands on Jessie's head, reviving Chansey's battle persona and she breaks free. Nurse Joy and the gang arrive and Joy tells Chansey to use Solar Beam, and the attack sends Team Rocket blasting off. Jessie notices the Nurse's hat and throws it away, and it lands on Chansey's head, calming her.\n\nBack at the Pokémon Center, Brock is grooming Chansey whilst Nurse Joy watches. In the background May comments that Ash and Brock are working really hard to achieve their dreams but she doesn't know what to do next. Inside the Fennel Valley ruins, Brandon is staring at an ancient tablet and is trying to figure out how to unlock its secret. Just as he realizes what to do Ash runs up to him. Ash is curious as to how his search is going and Brandon shows him by rearranging the symbols on the tablet to unlock a riddle that will guide him to the sealed chamber, and the location of a special {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. Brandon says he will leave after he and Ash have had their battle, but reminds him not to get carried away as this is what allowed the [[King of Pokélantis]] to possess him in their [[AG178|last battle]]. Brandon asks Ash if he wants to know what Pokémon he will be using in their battle, and Ash says he does want to know. Brandon says he will be using his {{DL|Brandon's Legendary titans|Registeel}}.\n\nAt the video-phone in the Pokémon Center, Ash is talking to {{an|Professor Oak}} about his upcoming battle and what Pokémon he should use. As Registeel is a {{type|Steel}} Brock says that any {{t|Fire}}, {{t|Ground}} or {{type|Fighting}} Pokémon would be a good choice. Ash makes his choice and he transfers {{AP|Aipom}} to [[Professor Oak's Laboratory]]. Professor Oak tells him that the Pokémon he has chosen has learned a new [[move]] recently so it will be good to try out that move in battle. As Ash prepares for his battle, Aipom is confused when she is released from her {{i|Poké Ball}} and promptly attacks the Professor.\n\nJust before the battle, Ash is revealed to have been doing some last-minute training with his chosen Pokémon in order to try out its new move. Now inside the Battle Pyramid, the two Trainers face off. The referee says that it will be a one-on-one battle. Brandon sends out his Registeel and Ash sends out his {{AP|Torkoal}}. Max remarks how Ash has the type advantage and Scott says how Ash is playing it by the book. \n\nThe referee starts the match with Ash telling Torkoal to start with {{m|Flamethrower}}. The attack hits its mark and Brandon has his Registeel counter with {{m|Metal Claw}}. Ash tells Torkoal to dodge and use {{m|Body Slam}} which it does, knocking Registeel over. Ash compliments Torkoal and Scott remarks how well Ash is doing. Brandon tells Registeel to use {{m|Zap Cannon}} and Ash counters with Flamethrower. The two attacks collide creating an explosion. Brandon has Registeel use {{m|Lock-On}} and then Zap Cannon and Ash tells Torkoal to use {{m|Iron Defense}}. The attack hits and manages to {{status|paralysis|paralyze}} Torkoal but the damage is reduced due to Iron Defense. Ash has Torkoal use Body Slam and Registeel tries to counter with Metal Claw. However, before it can attack the paralyzing sparks on Torkoal spread to Registeel and immobilize Registeel and the attack fails. Brandon compliments Ash on his strategy but says he is overconfident, and then orders Registeel to throw Torkoal. It does so, but Ash counters by having Torkoal use the wall to redirect another Body Slam.\n\nBrandon says he is impressed but now wants Ash to throw everything at him. Ash tells Torkoal to use {{m|Heat Wave}}, the new attack that it learned at Professor Oak's Lab. Brandon has Registeel break free from the attack and Ash has Torkoal send another Flamethrower at it. Brandon tells Registeel to use {{m|Sandstorm}} which blocks the attack and traps Torkoal in the vortex. Brandon has Registeel use another Sandstorm but Ash orders Torkoal to counter with Heat Wave. Pushing the Sandstorm back, Torkoal manages to trap Registeel. Registeel uses another Zap Cannon but Torkoal dodges it and, under Ash's command, uses the power of the Sandstorm to strengthen its Body Slam. The attack hits but Registeel holds on and uses Lock-On followed by another Zap Cannon. The vortex charges up the attack and the resulting explosion destroys the blazing Sandstorm. The smoke clears and both Torkoal and Registeel are still standing. But Torkoal falls down and Ash loses again.\n\nBrandon says that he fought well and he will be ready once Ash and his Pokémon learn to fight as one. Outside, Brandon is about to set off to find the sealed chamber and the special Pokémon that he has been searching for. He says Ash can challenge him again when he returns.\n\nThe episode ends with Brandon leaving as Ash prepares to train for [[AG189|his rematch]] with Brandon.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrive in [[Fennel Valley]] and meet {{FB|Pyramid King|Brandon}} again.\n* Ash sends his {{AP|Aipom}} to {{an|Professor Oak}}'s {{TP|Professor Oak|Laboratory}} in exchange for his {{AP|Torkoal}}, which is revealed to have learned {{m|Heat Wave}}.\n* Ash's Torkoal battles {{DL|Brandon's Legendary titans|Registeel|Brandon's Registeel}} in an official {{pkmn|battle}}, but is defeated.\n* Brandon leaves the [[Battle Pyramid]] to {{pkmn2|caught|catch}} a Pokémon, presumably {{DL|Brandon's Legendary titans|Regice}}, on his own.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n=====TV episode debuts=====\n* {{p|Registeel}} ({{DL|Brandon's Legendary titans|Registeel|Brandon's}})\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{an|Professor Oak}}\n* {{an|Giovanni}} ([[Boss fantasy|fantasy]])\n* {{FB|Pyramid King|Brandon}}\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* [[Scott]]\n* [[Samuel]]\n* {{FB|Raoul|Contesta}} (photo)\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Mime Jr.}} ({{OP|James|Mime Jr.}})\n* {{p|Corphish}} ({{OP|Ash|Corphish}})\n* {{p|Torkoal}} ({{OP|Ash|Torkoal}})\n* {{p|Aipom}} ({{OP|Ash|Aipom}})\n* {{p|Glalie}} ({{OP|Ash|Glalie}}; photo)\n* {{p|Combusken}} ({{OP|May|Combusken}}; photo)\n* {{p|Munchlax}} ({{OP|May|Munchlax}}; photo)\n* {{p|Registeel}} ({{DL|Brandon's Legendary titans|Registeel|Brandon's}})\n* {{p|Chansey}} ({{OP|Nurse Joy|Chansey}})\n\n==Trivia==\n* {{so|Battle Frontier}} is used as background music.\n* This is the only episode in which a {{p|Chansey}} uses non-{{type|Normal}} moves, these being the {{type|Fighting}} {{m|Dynamic Punch}} and {{type|Grass}} {{m|Solar Beam}}.\n* {{TRT}}'s fantasy of Chansey sparring with {{an|Giovanni}} in boxing may be a reference to the [[Lucky Punch]], an item that resembles a boxing glove and only works with Chansey.\n* The puzzle {{FB|Pyramid King|Brandon}} solves in the ruins resembles those found in the [[Ruins of Alph]].\n* This is one of the few times that one of {{Ash}}'s Pokémon learns a new move while not in his care.\n* This episode's [[Nurse Joy]] is one of the few to appear in consecutive episodes, being in the next four.\n* This is the first episode in which {{an|Professor Oak}} is voiced by [[Billy Beach]].\n* When Nurse Joy brings {{AP|Corphish}} out on a stretcher, the pictures on a poster behind her (which are almost incomprehensible) seem to look like a {{p|Glaceon}} (which was not revealed until [[Generation IV]]) at the top and a {{p|Vaporeon}} at the bottom. The bottom left picture cannot be entirely made out.\n* Team Rocket doesn't recite their {{motto}} in this episode.\n\n===Errors===\n* When Corphish hits Chansey with its {{m|Crabhammer}}, Chansey's tail is a darker pink than usual.\n* Chansey's egg pouch appears to be barely attached to her body while Team Rocket carries her. Normally, the egg pouch looks like a pocket.\n* Before Ash sends her to {{an|Professor Oak}}, {{TP|Dawn|Aipom|Ambipom}}'s head is bigger than usual.\n* Although Professor Oak already knew that Ash had six Pokémon on his team at the time, he is still surprised to see Aipom for the first time.\n* After Ash and Brandon's battle starts, [[Max]] speaks but has Ash's voice. <!-- In which language version? -->\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=77FF77|bordercolor=55DD55\n|zh_cmn={{tt|再度挑戰對戰金字塔！對抗雷吉斯奇魯！！|Challenging Battle Pyramid Again!
