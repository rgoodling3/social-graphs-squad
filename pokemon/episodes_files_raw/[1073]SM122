It first aired in Japan on May 19, 2019, in Australia on September 11, 2019, and in the United States on September 21, 2019.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/22_30-spying-for-the-big-guy/-->\n<i>When Team Rocket receives a call from Headquarters, they come to regret their previous claim to have caught Bewear, as Matori tells them to send the Pokémon to Giovanni right away. But, of course, they haven’t actually caught Bewear—if anything, Bewear has caught them. Panic ensues when Matori arrives in Alola, but Jessie, James, and Meowth convince her that they need Bewear’s help to catch an even more impressive Pokémon. Eventually, Matori changes plans and tries to steal Stufful instead, but a disguised Meowth thwarts her plan by taking the little Pokémon’s place. Then, just in the nick of time, Bewear swoops in to take Meowth back home!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{TRT}} prepares to head off for another day of selling [[malasada]]s, but a sudden alert from the {{an|Team Rocket HQ}} stops the trio in their tracks. [[Matori]] appears on the monitor and, after noticing the trio is behaving strangely, delivers them a message directly from {{an|Giovanni}} – to send through all of the Pokémon they have caught in [[Alola]] to the HQ. As the trio panics, {{MTR}} reveals that they promised Bewear to Matori and Giovanni sometime earlier. [[Matori\'s Meowth]] appears onscreen and orders the trio to stop crying and get on with the job, which only infuriates Meowth. Matori adds that Giovanni has given the order for Bewear to be brought in by any means, including by force, before signing off with "See you in Alola".\n\nAt the [[Pokémon School]], {{an|Professor Kukui}} expresses his pride to see all of his students possessing [[Z-Ring]]s. {{an|Sophocles}} says that he has been studying how to operate the device, {{an|Lillie}} hopes to perfect her {{m|Subzero Slammer}} technique, and {{an|Mallow}} is still getting used to wearing a Z-Ring. Kukui declares that the three students should use their school time to practice their [[Z-Move]] poses. When {{Ash}}, {{an|Lana}}, and {{an|Kiawe}} declare their excitement for the upcoming [[Alola League]], Kukui suggests the three should practice using the Z-Moves within their {{pkmn|battle}} strategies. He adds that they have to consider which [[Z-Crystal]], [[move]] combination, Pokémon selection, and the timing if they wish to amplify the effectiveness of the powerful Z-Moves. With everyone on board, Kukui calls for everyone to join him in the schoolyard for some training.\n\nMeanwhile, the Team Rocket trio watches as Bewear returns to [[Bewear\'s den|her den]] with some {{Berries}}. Jessie and [[James]] prepare to call out their Pokémon, but then, they express some doubts on whether catching Bewear is the right thing to do. Jessie admits that they have been with Bewear for some time and suggests that she might be okay with being caught by them. With this conclusion in mind, she throws a {{i|Poké Ball}}, but Bewear suddenly grabs it and crushes it into tiny pieces between her paws. As Bewear leaves the den once again, Jessie and James declare that neither Bewear, nor Stufful and their own Pokémon, would want to be transferred to the Team Rocket HQ.\n\nMatori and her Meowth suddenly arrive on the scene. She is instantly perplexed as [[Jessie\'s Mimikyu]] roams around freely and Stufful sits on the ground like a stuffed toy. However, Matori is startled by James\'s ghastly appearance after being suffocated by his own {{TP|James|Mareanie}}. She hears a high-pitched scream in the distance and grins to her Meowth. Matori and the others rush over to watch Bewear as she re-plants an uprooted tree into the ground. She is instantly impressed by Bewear\'s physical prowess and orders the Rocket trio to hand her over immediately. Jessie, James and Meowth reply that they simply can\'t, but the vague excuse doesn\'t impress Matori who presses for answers. Jessie admits that she is planning on catching some other strong Pokémon for the boss with the help of Bewear\'s strength, and her teammates back up her story. Matori accepts their excuse before adding that she will keep an eye on the trio while they complete the task. Matori reiterates that if they fail, she will take Bewear to HQ. The fake story failed to bide the Rocket trio any time, but Jessie boasts that she is up to the challenge and exchanges a sharp stare with Matori.\n\nThe Rocket trio take Matori to the Pokémon School, where they explain that [[Ash\'s Meltan]] is a tiny, but powerful Pokémon that doesn\'t even appear in the [[Pokédex]]. They also declare that {{AP|Lycanroc}} and {{AP|Pikachu}} are also incredibly tough. Jessie and her teammates are left gobsmacked when they see that all of the children are currently practicing Z-Move poses. The thought of being blasted off is now a far easier thing to accomplish, which terrifies the trio. Matori and her Meowth call for calm, admitting that its looks to be only practice. Through her binoculars, Matori points out that Lillie and the others don\'t even have Z-Crystals in their Z-Rings. Matori declares that while the trio are simply {{tc|Team Rocket Grunt}}s, they need to remain level-headed and sharp at all times. Jessie apologizes, admitting that she and her teammates are neither cool or collected. However their worst fears are soon confirmed when Ash has his Pikachu perform {{m|Corkscrew Crash}} on their hiding place, sending Matori and the Rocket trio blasting off.\n\nWhile one plan is thwarted, Team Rocket remain determined to prove themselves and set their sights on another incredibly strong Pokémon, [[Grandpa Forest]]. James throws out handful of [[Haban Berry|Haban Berries]] in a bid to attract Grandpa Forest out hiding. Soon enough, Grandpa Forest moves into sight and begins feasting on the bait. Matori and her Meowth watch on in curiousity, but they still have their doubts. Jessie calls out her Mimikyu, but it is disappointed not to be facing up against Pikachu and simply walks away. James calls on Mareanie, and she promptly leaps onto James\'s head to poison him. Jessie throws the Z-Ring to James, and he places the [[Darkinium Z]] onto it. Meowth and Jessie assist James in performing a group Z-pose. Mareanie soon charges with power and begins to unleash a {{m|Black Hole Eclipse}}. However, the arrival of Stufful stops Team Rocket, and soon Bewear swings in and collects everyone in her arms.\n\nBack at her den, Bewear stares at Matori and her Meowth. The pair become terrified as Bewear looks to punch them out, but instead she delivers them a fist of honey each. The sweetness of the honey and gesture surprises Matori, and Meowth explains that Bewear simply wants to be a good host to her guests. Overnight, Bewear is out floating in a lake and staring at the moon while the Rocket trio and Stufful sleep soundly. However, Matori is still determined to fulfil her mission and goes onto snatch Stufful up. The slight disturbance wakes Meowth and {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} up, and they go onto inform Jessie and James of the quick grab. The Rocket trio are left conflicted as they wish to follow Giovanni\'s orders, but they truly value their friendship with Bewear. Jessie goes onto follow after Matori, and she strikes up a conversation as a delay tactic. Matori places Stufful down next to her Meowth as she attempts to dissuade any suspicions. Meanwhile James and Wobbuffet crawl their way over to rescue Stufful and make a quick swap with a decoy. Jessie waves off Matori, who grabs the decoy and rushes into her waiting aircraft bound for the [[Kanto]] [[region]]. Inside her ride, Matori peers at her catch, but she instead finds Meowth [[List of Team Rocket\'s disguises|disguised as a Stufful]]. She grabs him and demands answers immediately. Matori\'s Meowth instantly goes on the attack, but the commotion alerts Bewear to the scene. Bewear lands on the helicopter\'s windscreen and crashes her way through to save Meowth from Matori. As Bewear leaps with Meowth to safety a large explosion occurs in the helicopter\'s tail.\n\nThe following day, the Rocket trio are enjoying the peace of their Alolan lifestyle, and lay outside the den with Bewear and Stufful. Meowth queries what happened to Matori and her crew, but the others genuinely don\'t know and neither care about giving it any thought. Suddenly a small Rocket robot rolls in to give them an update. Matori, with a bandaged arm and head, and her Meowth appear on the screen. However, the pair are instantly frightened when Bewear stares back at them. Bewear ends the transmission abruptly by crushing the robot with her paws.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
