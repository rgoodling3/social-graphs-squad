It first aired in Japan on May 26, 2019 and in the United States on September 28, 2019.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/22_31-a-fiery-training-camp-trick/-->\n<i>Excitement is building for the upcoming Alola Pokémon League, and the Pokémon School class is ready to train! Ash, Kiawe, and Sophocles decide to camp out at Kiawe’s family farm, but Sophocles is having a hard time working up the confidence to pull off a Z-Move. To help Sophocles train, Kiawe secretly enlists the help of a wild Crawdaunt who previously clashed with Turtonator. Crawdaunt launches a surprise attack on Sophocles, but Sophocles manages to overcome his fear and launch a powerful Z-Move with Vikavolt! The circumstances of the battle may have been unusual, but Sophocles is feeling more confident with a Z-Move at his command!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the [[Pokémon School]] grounds, {{an|Lana}} shows {{an|Lillie}} and {{an|Mallow}} her perfected [[Z-Move]] pose as she performs {{m|Oceanic Operetta}} with {{TP|Lana|Primarina}}. Just then, {{an|Professor Kukui}} walks over and asks the trio if they are participating in the upcoming {{al|Pokémon League}}. Lana affirms it, and with her encouragement, Lillie and Mallow decide to compete as well. Meanwhile, as the boys are also in the middle of practicing their own Z-Moves. After {{an|Sophocles}} and {{TP|Sophocles|Vikavolt}} fail to execute {{m|Savage Spin-Out}}, {{Ash}} explains that Sophocles wasn\'t in sync with Vikavolt at all. Professor Kukui steps in and suggests that some actual practice would be better. {{an|Kiawe}} adds that he will host a Z-Move boot camp at [[Paniola Ranch|his home]]. Ash is thrilled by the idea and Sophocles decides to join them. Lillie invites the other girls over to her place so they can practice as well.\n\nThe boys arrive at Kiawe\'s family farm, though Sophocles is shocked to learn that they will actually be camping in the surrounding forests instead. Kiawe explains that the isolated location will allow them all to concentrate on their training. Kiawe\'s younger sister [[Mimo]] is keen to come along, but [[Sima]] reiterates that the boys aren\'t camping for fun before taking her daughter away by the hand. Kiawe escorts his friends up to an ancient altar where people once worshiped [[Wela Volcano Park|Wela Volcano]]. After setting up their tent, the boys call out all of their Pokémon to enjoy the fresh air.\n\nMeanwhile, Ash and the guys have begun their training. The trio stands directly under a waterfall, which Kiawe explains is meant to build up stamina and mental strength. They go on a quick rock climb, followed by a swinging log obstacle course. However, Sophocles is struggling from all of the strenuous activity and asks if there are any other ways to learn to use Z-Moves, but Kiawe denies this, leaving Sophocles dismayed. Kiawe claims he will definitely be able to learn something under the watch of the Wela Volcano, but Sophocles demands a more scientific solution. He orders Vikavolt and {{TP|Sophocles|Togedemaru}} to leave, but finds that his Pokémon are busy practicing. Inspired by their commitment, Sophocles apologizes to his friends for giving up and his resolve is restored.\n\nThe boys return to their campsite, where Sophocles falls onto his knees, wondering why the training is not working. Ash and Kiawe are equally concerned, though Kiawe notes that this is something that Sophocles will have to figure out on his own. Sophocles\'s stomach suddenly grumbles and his attention turns to food once again. At that moment, Sima and Mimo bring baskets of food for the camp. During lunch, Turtonator offers Togedemaru some of its own dinner, whereas {{TP|Kiawe|Marowak}} swipes {{AP|Pikachu}}\'s bowl for an extra helping. Pikachu quickly realizes and tries to snatch his food back. Luckily Turtonator pulls Marowak up, though Marowak replies with a {{m|Headbutt}}, only to find itself trapped in Turtonator\'s shell opening.\n\nKiawe is unimpressed to see Marowak squabbling with Turtonator again, and he admits Turtonator has always been compassionate ever since they first met. Kiawe reveals that he first encountered Turtonator during one of his milk deliveries. It was in a {{pkmn|battle}} with a {{p|Crawdaunt}} and collapsed after being hit by several {{t|Water}} attacks. Kiawe and his {{TP|Kiawe|Charizard}} tried to help the injured Turtonator, but he refused their assistance and began to walk off. Crawdaunt challenged Turtonator again and scared off the other [[wild Pokémon]]. Kiawe continued to watch each day as Turtonator kept taking on Crawdaunt, who had taken possession of a local pond for itself, and losing. Kiawe again offered his assistance and handed Turtonator a Moomoo Milk drink as a remedy. The kind gesture led Turtonator to develop a trust towards Kiawe, and the pair began practicing together. Turtonator learned {{m|Shell Trap}} during the training sessions and the new [[move]] helped him defeat Crawdaunt. Afterwards, Kiawe tried to leave, but Turtonator stopped him. Kiawe realized Turtonator wanted to join him and {{pkmn2|caught}} it. Kiawe\'s story leads Sophocles to question his own bonds with his Pokémon. After Togedemaru and Vikavolt approach their {{pkmn|Trainer}}, Ash points out that Sophocles also has a strong bond with his Pokémon.\n\nWhile everyone is sound asleep for the night, Kiawe disturbs {{Rotom}} to ask for its assistance. Kiawe also calls on Turtonator for help, and the trio prepare something for the following day. The morning arrives and Kiawe calls Ash away to help him with another task. He orders Sophocles to pick up sticks. Sophocles queries why, and Kiawe replies that he will explain later before he and everyone walk away. Rotom is overly nervous and offers Sophocles advice to hang in there, but the odd statement doesn’t reveal anything. As Sophocles and his Pokémon set about collecting sticks, Kiawe and the others wait in hiding. A Crawdaunt emerges from the nearby lake. Ash is keen to rush into help, but Kiawe reminds him that the practice against a strong opponent like Crawdaunt may help. Sophocles calls out for his friends, though no one responds. Crawdaunt approaches with a {{m|Crabhammer}}, though Vikavolt intercepts it. Crawdaunt tries to strike Vikavolt with its claw, but its target evades. However a follow-up {{m|Aqua Jet}} knocks Vikavolt to the ground. Sophocles call for a {{m|Discharge}} attack, but Crawdaunt leaps out of the way. An attempted {{m|String Shot}} also fails. Crawdaunt uses an uppercut attack to send Vikavolt into the air, and its crashes into the ground below. Ash rushes forward, but Kiawe reiterates that it is Sophocles\'s battle. Sophocles calls for Vikavolt to run, but his Pokémon ignores the command and starts buzzing around Crawdaunt. Vikavolt\'s unrelenting spirit causes Sophocles to regain his composure and swell with confidence. Crawdaunt strikes Vikavolt down with its claws and continues to batter it even while it is down. Sophocles orders a Signal Beam on the ground, and the manoeuvre gives Vikavolt the height to evade another attack. Discharge also hits its mark. Sophocles suddenly notices that his [[Buginium Z]] is glimmering with power and he manages to summon a fully powered Savage Spin-Out attack. Vikavolt traps Crawdaunt in a silky white cocoon, and after a throw around, it slashes through the cocoon. Crawdaunt crashes into the ground, knocked out. Sophocles realizes that he has finally mastered a Z-Move and his Pokémon congratulate him with an overwhelming embrace. Kiawe and the others emerge from hiding and are thrilled by the latest development.\n\nAs everyone is chatting, Crawdaunt perks up and rushes towards them with a raised claw. Sophocles warns Kiawe about the oncoming attack, but it shocked to see Kiawe and Crawdaunt exchange a fist-bump instead. Kiawe explains that after he and Turtonator had defeated it, Crawdaunt had a change of heart and is now a close friend. He reveals that Rotom also helped him to arrange the battle encounter last night. Kiawe rewards Crawdaunt with a [[Sitrus Berry]] for its efforts. The other wild Pokémon, a {{p|Mareep}}, {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Oricorio|Pa\'u Style}} {{p|Oricorio}} and {{p|Bonsly}} also appear to greet Kiawe. Sophocles wishes that Kiawe had simply told him, but Kiawe declares that the practice was invaluable. Ash congratulates Sophocles on finally mastering Z-Moves and adds that they will continue training for the Alola League all day long. However the thought of further training makes Sophocles turn pale and he soon collapses.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
