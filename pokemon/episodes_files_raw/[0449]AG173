Gold Legend!?\'\') is the 173rd episode of the {{series|Advanced Generation}}, and the 447th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on April 20, 2006, and in the United States on November 28, 2006.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/09_28-all-that-glitters-is-not-golden/-->\n<i>Ash and May spot an amazing golden Sudowoodo at the edge of a lake, but it knocks Ash\'s Poké Ball away when he tries to catch it. Brock and the others don\'t believe it, until they reach the next town and find a saloon full of locals looking for the golden Sudowoodo. They also meet Keenan, the golden Sudowoodo\'s Trainer, who can\'t explain why it\'s golden or why it ran away from him. Our heroes happily decide to help Keenan find Sudowoodo, yet Keenan doesn\'t seem to want the help.\n\nTeam Rocket is already on the hunt, and they catch the Sudowoodo at the lake. Ash stops them just in time, but Sudowoodo won\'t even return to its Poké Ball and runs off again. Keenan finally explains why: he experimented on it to help it overcome its dislike of water, and that\'s how it became golden. He can turn it back to normal if he can get it back home—easier said than done after Sudowoodo wanders into town and ends up chased by a gold-hunting mob!\n\nTeam Rocket shows up with the Bonsai Boy robot and tries to grab Sudowoodo for themselves. Keenan throws himself in front of the robot to protect Sudowoodo, who realizes Keenan never meant it any harm. Sudowoodo uses Brick Break to wreck the robot, and Pikachu takes care of Team Rocket. After Keenan turns Sudowoodo back to normal, the treasure hunters don\'t even notice it since it\'s no longer golden. With another good deed done, our heroes continue on their way!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{ashfr|The group}} decide to stop for lunch as they make their way to the [[Battle Pyramid]]. While {{an|May}} and {{Ash}} volunteer to collect water, they encounter a golden {{p|Sudowoodo}}. Ash is intrigued, after {{AP|Pikachu}} strikes Sudowoodo down with {{m|Thunderbolt}}, and attempts to capture it. The {{pkmn2|wild}} golden Sudowoodo, manages to block the oncoming {{i|Poké Ball}}. After a few moments of resistance, it forces the Poké Ball back towards Ash, striking the young Trainer in the face. Sudowoodo promptly sprints off into the distance, leaving Ash nursing his bruise.\n \nThe group wander into a nearby town looking for a restaurant after Ash and May failed to retrieve any water needed for cooking lunch. May and Ash later recount their story to {{an|Brock}} and [[Max]], though they have their doubts. They soon enter a saloon-style restaurant filled with some particularly menacing patrons. May then notices a poster inside advertising the next [[Pokémon Contest]] is going to be hosted in [[Mulberry City]]. As May mentions her sighting of the Sudowoodo, almost every patron inside of the establishment surrounds her demanding to know more about the Sudowoodo sighting. Everyone begins fighting over the incident as a young man motions for the group to evade the feuding patrons. [[Keenan]] rushes Ash and the others inside his home, successfully escaping the mob of people. He draws the curtains closed before revealing a photograph featuring himself alongside the mysterious golden Sudowoodo. Keenan explains that the golden Sudowoodo is his, and its special color gives it water resistance, much to May\'s disappointment. Max is curious as to how Sudowoodo became gold-colored. Keenan replies that he doesn’t know, though Brock suspects that it may have polishes itself against rare metals like other {{t|Rock}} types like {{p|Onix}}. Ash offers to help Keenan locate his missing Sudowoodo, though he doesn’t appear all that thrilled to have the assistance. Meanwhile, having eavesdropped on the conversation, {{TRT}} have also set their sights on the golden Sudowoodo.\n\nTeam Rocket are first to arrive at the lake. [[Jessie]] believes the lake water and a resident goddess may be responsible for Sudowoodo’s golden hue. She volunteers to offer {{TP|James|Mime Jr.}} as tribute, though [[James]] yells at her for that. Instead, they disguise {{MTR}} as a Sudowoodo and prepare to kick him into the lake as an offering. However, the real golden Sudowoodo bursts from the water. Meowth returns the favour, dressing Jessie in a diving suit with an attached rocket booster pack and net in hand. Jessie is unprepared as she is propelled forward, though she manages to net the golden Sudowoodo. The group and Keenan soon arrive, with Pikachu threatening Team Rocket with his sparking cheeks. James and Meowth instantly flee, fearing another blast off. Jessie, however, stands her ground. So Keenan tries to [[recall]] Sudowoodo back to its Poké Ball. The Sudowoodo dodges the red beam, and Jessie is struck instead. She soon flees like her teammates.\n\nAsh notices that Sudowoodo doesn\'t seem happy to see Keenan, though he insists that it is his Pokémon. Brock calls upon {{TP|Brock|Bonsly}} to converse with Sudowoodo. However, Sudowoodo flat out refuses to return and dashes off into the distance. Keenan begins running after Sudowoodo, but the pursuit ends after he trips over. After Keenan recovers from the fall, he manages to let slip how Sudowoodo actually managed to turn "golden". In an attempt to strengthen Sudowoodo, he performed an experiment on it, and this resulted in Sudowoodo\'s unusual golden color. However, Sudowoodo was less than impressed and abandoned Keenan. Ash and his friends offer their assistance, hoping to bring Sudowoodo back to Keenan\'s for a reversal experiment.\n\nMeanwhile, Team Rocket have actively been tracking Sudowoodo down in their balloon. Meowth takes aim before firing several nets at Sudowoodo, driving the golden Pokémon to flee into the nearby town and saloon from earlier. The patrons look surprised doubting what they have seen. Sudowoodo begins moving backwards and rushes outside followed by the group of men. Keenan waves and motions Sudowoodo towards his location but Sudowoodo just ignores Keenan\'s call and heads down another street. Seeing the competition, Team Rocket takes evasive action, activating their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|Potted Bonsai Boy Mark 1]]. Sudowoodo narrowly dodges the mecha\'s grasp, though a water tower is consequently knocked over. Pikachu attempts a Thunderbolt, but the mecha is electric-proof. The mecha rushes forward with another attack, though Keenan intervenes with a shovel in hand. The mecha knocks him aside and preares to snatch Sudowoodo. Keenan, however, remains determined and grasps onto the mecha\'s legs attempting to halt its approach. Sudowoodo becomes inspired by Keenan\'s heroic efforts and strikes forward knocking the mecha backwards. Sudowoodo rotates forward with a final strike of {{m|Brick Break}} destroying the mecha. Pikachu then follows with a Thunderbolt, blasting Team Rocket off. \n\nKeenan apologizes to Sudowoodo, hugging it as he promised to revert its golden state. Keenan and others are confronted by the keen group of men once again, though manage to reach the safety of Keenan\'s home. Sudowoodo is placed inside of the strange machine once more and the effect is reversed returning Sudowoodo to its non-golden color. Afterwards, the group and Keenan along with Sudowoodo stroll past the prospective men with ease. Keenan is relieved that he and Sudowoodo are a team once again. He wishes May all the best with the Mulberry Contest before waving the group off.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} tries to catch a {{p|Sudowoodo}}, but fails due to it already having a {{pkmn|Trainer}}.\n* {{an|May}} learns that a [[Pokémon Contest]] will be held in [[Mulberry City]].\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{an|Giovanni}} ([[Boss fantasy|fantasy]])\n* [[Lilian Meridian]] (poster)\n* [[Keenan]]\n* Cowboys\n* Fountain Goddess (Jessie\'s fantasy)\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Bonsly}} ({{OP|Brock|Bonsly}})\n* {{p|Sudowoodo}} (temporarily {{DL|List of alternately colored Pokémon in the anime|Non-standard alternate coloration|golden}}; [[Keenan]]\'s)\n* {{p|Onix}} (fantasy; evolves)\n* {{p|Steelix}} (fantasy; newly evolved)\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:Spurt Ranger variation.png|thumb|250px|Solana & Jack in the opening]]\n* [[Solana]] and [[Jack Walker]] replace the final scene in the Japanese opening. This is the first time that a movie-exclusive character has appeared in the {{pkmn|anime}}.\n* [[I Won\'t Lose! ~Haruka\'s Theme~]] replaced [[GLORY DAY ~That Shining Day~]] as the [[List of Japanese ending themes|Japanese ending theme]].\n* [[Pokémon Symphonic Medley]] and the ballad version of {{so|Battle Frontier}} are used as background music.\n* This is the last episode to be animated by Team Ota. Team Iguchi animated the episodes from [[AG174]] to [[DP159]].\n* This episode reveals that if a human gets hit by the tractor beam that a [[Poké Ball]] creates when returning a {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} into it, they will get stunned for a short period of time.\n* [[Jessie]]\'s fantasy comes from a Japanese tale about one throwing an object by accident and it turning into gold. There is a similar Western fairytale, where a woodsman loses his axe in a lake. The lake\'s spirit asks if he had lost an axe of pure silver or one of pure gold, but the woodsman says he had lost a cheap axe. He is awarded both the silver and gold axes for his honesty.\n* The name of this episode is a parody on the famous phrase (which is itself a mistranslation of a line in \'\'{{wp|The Merchant of Venice}}\'\') "All that glitters is not gold". This reference is also made in \'\'[[EP184|All That Glitters!]]\'\'.\n* This is one of the few times in the anime that a different colored Pokémon appears, but is not the typical Shiny coloring.\n* Brock\'s explanation of an {{p|Onix}} evolving into {{p|Steelix}} foreshadows the [[evolution]] of {{TP|Brock|his Onix|Steelix}}, which is revealed [[AG177|four episodes later]].\n\n===Errors===\n* When everyone fled into [[Keenan]]\'s house for the first time, the golden {{p|Sudowoodo}} appeared on the screen for a split second.  The golden Sudowoodo wasn\'t with them at this point.\n* In the scene that shows an Onix evolving in the middle of Brock\'s explanation, Steelix is without its teeth.\n* As the golden Sudowoodo is running from [[Brock\'s Bonsly]], it has the colors of a normal Sudowoodo.\n* When Keenan waves goodbye for {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}}, his mouth moves as if he is speaking.\n\n<gallery>\nAG173 error 2.png|Sudowoodo appears\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=77FF77|bordercolor=55DD55\n|zh_cmn={{tt|胡說樹！黃金傳說！？|Sudowoodo!
