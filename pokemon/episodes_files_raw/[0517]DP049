It first aired in Japan on October 4, 2007 as part of a two-hour special alongside [[DP050]], and in the United States on January 26, 2008.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/10_48-dawns-early-night/-->\n<i>As our Heroes make their way through Hearthome City and to the Hearthome City Gym, they run into their friend Nando at the Gym door who tells them that the Gym Leader will be away for quite awhile, much to Ash’s dismay. But telling them about the upcoming Hearthome City Pokemon Tag Battle, Ash and Brock decided to enter that instead – as a team. Meanwhile, the Hearthome City Pokemon Contest is just getting underway, and Dawn finds herself competing along with Nando, Zoey, and Jessilina, who of course is actually Jessie in disguise.  Feeling very confident, Dawn gives a superb performance, but is sadly shocked to learn that she hasn’t even made it past the 1st round. As she struggles to cope with the situation, Jessilina is defeated by Nando, leaving Zoey and Nando battling in the finals, which Nando ultimately wins. Sharing feelings about their losses proves to cement Dawn and Zoey’s friendship even further, and as they both marvel at Nando’s ability to compete in both Pokemon Gym battles and Contests, the future begins to look much brighter for both of them, as the Pokemon Tag Battle is set to take place for Ash and Brock in a matter of days.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} race through [[Hearthome City]] to the [[Hearthome Gym|Gym]], Ash excited at the opportunity to win his third [[Gym]] [[Badge]]. {{AP|Staravia}} darts ahead as Ash\'s group leaves {{an|Dawn}} and {{an|Brock}} behind. At the doors, they run into [[Nando]], informing them that the [[Gym Leader]] isn\'t present. The news upsets Ash as he slams into the door. They notice a {{TP|Nando|Kricketune}}, which belongs to Nando, as Ash checks it with his [[Pokédex]]. Its musical nature imitation serves as the ideal {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} for Nando.\n\nBrock notices a note on the door as Nando recites what it says: the Gym Leader is out and won\'t be back for a while. Nando mentions the [[Hearthome City Tag Battle Competition]], a tournament where skilled {{pkmn|Trainer}}s pair up to compete in several rounds of [[Multi Battle|Tag Battle]]s, and suggests that they enter it instead. Ash is eager to get in, and Brock also agrees. Nando has decided to enter the [[Pokémon Contest]] instead, which reminds Dawn that she needs to register.\n\nAs Nando and Dawn walk to the [[Contest Hall]], Dawn finds out that he still has one [[Ribbon]] and one Badge. Dawn knows that it has been [[DP027|some time]] since the {{to|Floaroma}} Contest, but thanks to [[Zoey]]\'s help, she is confident about [[Double Performance]]s. At the Contest Hall, Zoey relaxes with {{cat|Zoey\'s Pokémon|her Pokémon}} as Dawn and Nando find her, Zoey\'s leg fully healed from [[DP041|her injury]]. Nando meets Zoey for the first time, but when Nando reveals his decision to participate in both Pokémon Contests and Gym battles, it draws criticism from Zoey. Meanwhile, [[Jessie]] puts on her "Jessilina" disguise and trains with {{TP|Jessie|Dustox}} and {{TP|Jessie|Seviper}}, but decides to use {{TP|James|Mime Jr.}} in the performance instead.\n\nAt the center, Dawn checks on {{cat|Dawn\'s Pokémon|her Pokémon}}, confident about the Contest. Still she feels nervous about the event. Zoey meets up with Ash and the others, mentioning the Tag Battle. Dawn thanks Zoey about her help, but starts to demonstrate overconfidence and less on her Pokémon.\n\nThe next day, the Hearthome Contest begins as the stadium roof opens, letting the sunshine in as [[Marian]] talks about Double Performances and introduces the [[Contest Judge]]s: [[Raoul Contesta]] from the [[Pokémon Activities Committee]], [[Mr. Sukizo]] from the [[Pokémon Fan Club]], and the [[Nurse Joy]] from the local [[Pokémon Center]]. The [[Appeal|Performance Stage]] begins with Nando as the first contestant, using his {{p|Sunflora}} and Kricketune. Sunflora\'s {{m|Grass Whistle}} and Kricketune\'s {{m|Sing}} combined with Nando\'s harp captivates the audience with the beautiful music. The performance gets Zoey\'s respect as Nando earns high marks.\n\nOther {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s take their turns, as Dawn is still confident despite many high-experience Coordinators. Her turn arrives as she takes the stage with {{TP|Dawn|Pachirisu}} and {{TP|Dawn|Piplup}}. Pachirisu launches {{m|Sweet Kiss}} while Piplup encases the attack with {{m|Bubble Beam}}. Pachirisu uses {{m|Discharge}} as Piplup uses {{m|Whirlpool}}, the electricity causing the whirlpool to dissipate in a flash of sparkles. She gets positive reviews, while [[Johanna|her mother]] watches from home intently.\n\nJessie takes her turn, sending out Mime Jr. and {{TP|James|Cacnea}}. Cacnea uses {{m|Needle Arm}}, which Mime Jr. {{m|Mimic}}s before using {{m|Tickle}} on Jessie as both Cacnea and Mime Jr. hug and tickle Jessie, spinning her around the stage. The unique experience gets Dawn\'s attention but actually creeps out Ash and Brock. Cacnea then fires {{m|Pin Missile}}, which Mime Jr. mimics, into the sky and creating fireworks.\n\nJessie gets a very high score as Zoey then takes the stage with {{TP|Zoey|Glameow}} and {{TP|Zoey|Shellos}}. Shellos fires {{m|Mud Bomb}} as Glameow\'s {{m|Iron Tail}} breaks the attack. Glameow taps into {{m|Secret Power}}, which creates a paralyzing light as on the stage. Glameow then prepares {{m|Shadow Claw}} to create a sparkle from the Secret Power. Shellos than launches {{m|Water Pulse}}, surrounding Glameow as it uses its claws to split the Water Pulse, causing the water to then rebound on itself and create a dazzling sparkle. Her performance also gets a great score.\n\nThe first round ends as the results are calculated. Backstage, Dawn {{pkmn|groomer|brushes the fur}} of her {{TP|Dawn|Buneary}} as Pachirisu eats a [[Poffin]], Dawn confident that she passed, even predicting that her and Zoey will be in the finals. The results are then announced as the eight Coordinators are posted one by one. Nando and Zoey take the top two and three. Other Coordinators are posted, leaving only one spot left, as Jessie and Dawn watch. The eighth Coordinator to advance to the [[Contest Battle]]s is not Dawn, but Jessie. Dawn is clearly upset as her friends notice, even her mother back in [[Twinleaf Town]]. Jessie is ecstatic at passing as Dawn\'s Pokémon try to cheer her up, as does Ash and her friends. Dawn is still clearly upset, even angry, as she gets up and runs out of the room. Zoey suggest that they leave her be for the moment as Dawn runs outside and lets out a scream of agony. Meanwhile, Jessie and Nando wind up battling as Nando\'s Kricketune easily takes out Jessie\'s Seviper and Dustox, depleting all her points and sending Nando to the finals.\n\nBackstage, Dawn gets back into her travel clothes as she heads out, Ash and Brock informing Dawn that the final round will pit Nando against Zoey. Ash and his friends watch as the crowd bustles with excitement. The scene then jumps to the following night. Ash and Brock talk to Johanna over the telephone, as she knows that both Dawn and Zoey are upset, since Nando managed to beat Zoey in the final round. Johanna decides to let Dawn talk to Zoey instead of her since they both can sympathize with one another. On the balcony, Zoey reveals her respect for Nando and her inspiration. Dawn\'s talk with Zoey helps put down her depression.\n<!--Written by rockersk08-->\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} meet up with [[Nando]] again.\n* Ash learns that [[Fantina|the Gym Leader]] of the [[Hearthome Gym]] is currently away.\n* Nando is revealed to have obtained a {{TP|Nando|Kricketune}}.\n* Ash and {{an|Brock}} decide to enter the [[Hearthome City Tag Battle Competition]] after learning about it from Nando.\n* {{an|Dawn}} meets up with [[Zoey]] again while Nando meets her for the first time.\n* Dawn, Zoey, Nando, and [[Jessie|Jessilina]] enter the Hearthome City Pokémon Contest.\n* Dawn loses in the [[Appeal|Performance Stage]] while her [[rival]]s advance to the [[Contest Battle|Battle Stage]].\n* Nando defeats Jessilina and Zoey to win the Hearthome [[Ribbon]], his second Contest Ribbon overall.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* [[Nando\'s Kricketune]]\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Zoey]]\n* [[Nando]]\n* [[Johanna]]\n* [[Marian]]\n* [[Raoul Contesta]]\n* [[Mr. Sukizo]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s\n* Audience\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Piplup}} ({{OP|Dawn|Piplup}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Mime Jr.}} ({{OP|James|Mime Jr.}})\n* {{p|Aipom}} ({{OP|Ash|Aipom}})\n* {{p|Staravia}} ({{OP|Ash|Staravia}})\n* {{p|Turtwig}} ({{OP|Ash|Turtwig}})\n* {{p|Buneary}} ({{OP|Dawn|Buneary}})\n* {{p|Pachirisu}} ({{OP|Dawn|Pachirisu}})\n* {{p|Buizel}} ({{OP|Dawn|Buizel}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Dustox}} ({{OP|Jessie|Dustox}})\n* {{p|Cacnea}} ({{OP|James|Cacnea}})\n* {{p|Glameow}} ({{OP|Johanna|Glameow}})\n* {{p|Glameow}} ({{OP|Zoey|Glameow}})\n* {{p|Misdreavus}} ([[Zoey]]\'s)\n* {{p|Shellos}} ({{OP|Zoey|Shellos}})\n* {{p|Roselia}} ({{OP|Nando|Roselia}})\n* {{p|Sunflora}} ([[Nando]]\'s)\n* {{p|Kricketune}} ({{OP|Nando|Kricketune}})\n* {{p|Psyduck}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Duskull}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Solrock}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Lunatone}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Smoochum}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Steelix}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Cubone}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Marowak}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Chansey}}\n* {{p|Teddiursa}}\n* {{p|Stantler}}\n* {{p|Furret}}\n* {{p|Sunkern}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[Paul\'s Torterra]], {{TP|Paul|Ursaring}}, and {{p|Weavile}} are added to the Japanese opening.\n* The ending is omitted in the original Japanese broadcast, with the credits moved to the opening instead (scrolling from right to left).\n* Music from \'\'[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]\'\', \'\'[[M08|Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]\'\', the instrumental version of [[By Your Side ~Hikari\'s Theme~]], and [[Together / By Your Side ~Hikari\'s Theme~|its ballad version]] are used as background music.\n* This marks the second time that a {{ashfr|main character}} lost in the appeal round.

However, it is possible that they do not have that kind of authority in the Sinnoh [[region]].\n* This episode was initially [[Banned episodes#Banned episodes in other countries|skipped]] in {{pmin|New Zealand}} for unknown reasons.
