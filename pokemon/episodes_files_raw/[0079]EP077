Unexpected Rival!\'\') is the 77th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on January 1, 1999 and in the United States on November 13, 1999. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/02_23-the-fourth-round-rumble/-->\n<i>Ash\'s fourth battle on the Grass Field is against his toughest opponent yet! He battles Jeanette Fisher from Crimson City who brings a whole cheering section with her. Jeanette uses a powerful Scyther, which Ash has never battled before. Will his Bulbasaur be able whip Scyther\'s double team attack by using his reliable vine whip? To finish off the match, Jeanette brings out her Bellsprout which Ash feel is far inferior to his Pokémon. Once again, Ash lets his over-confidence take over.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}}, {{AP|Pikachu}}, {{an|Misty}}, and {{an|Brock}} watch {{Gary}}\'s fourth round match on the Rock Field, and are shocked when Gary is abruptly defeated by a {{pkmn|Trainer}} named [[Melissa]]. This leaves Ash worried about his own chances during the fourth round, though Brock and Misty cheer him on. He later learns from {{an|Professor Oak}} that all of [[Pallet Town]] is cheering him on, which only makes him more nervous. Meanwhile, {{TRT}} opens up a souvenir stand with the intent of luring in and stealing {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} from Trainers.\n\nAt the Grass Field, Ash starts his next match with [[Jeanette Fisher]] from [[Crimson City]]. He sends out {{AP|Bulbasaur}}, and Jeanette uses {{p|Beedrill}}. The {{type|Bug}} Pokémon is about to hit Bulbasaur with {{m|Poison Sting}}, but Bulbasaur dodges it. Bulbasaur uses {{m|Razor Leaf}}, but Beedrill counters with {{m|Twineedle}}. Bulbasaur dodges the attack again. Ash then has Bulbasaur use {{m|Leech Seed}}, which instantly drains Beedrill\'s energy, before having Bulbasaur finish it off with {{m|Tackle}}. Jeanette then sends out her next Pokémon, {{p|Scyther}}. Bulbasaur launches a {{m|Razor Leaf}} at it, but Scyther uses {{m|Double Team}} to evade. Scyther gets in a few hits before Ash gets the idea to use {{m|Vine Whip}} on all the duplicates, so Bulbasaur will eventually hit the real one. The plan works, and Scyther is knocked out.\n\nUnwavering, Jeanette calls on her last Pokémon, a {{p|Bellsprout}}. Ash laughs and calls it weak as the Flower Pokémon wiggles its body in an odd manner. Bulbasaur uses Tackle, but Bellsprout evades the attack with ease. It then picks up Bulbasaur, repeatedly {{m|slam}}s him into the ground, and knocks Bulbasaur out, shocking Ash. Brock realizes that Jeanette\'s Bellsprout must be exceptionally trained, or else it would not be used in a League battle. Ash sends out {{AP|Pikachu}}, and he uses {{m|Thunder Shock}}, but Bellsprout dodges the attack and uses Razor Leaf. Pikachu dodges it and tries to use {{m|Thunderbolt}}, but Bellsprout\'s roots keep him ingrained and immune to {{t|Electric}} attacks. Pikachu tries to punch and box-kick Bellsprout, but it slams him again and defeats him.\n\nDown to his last Pokémon, Ash pauses for a second and then sends out his {{AP|Muk}}, surprising his friends. Muk is able to absorb Bellsprout\'s Slam and Razor Leaf attacks with ease, then uses a {{m|Body Slam}}. Its powerful stench and weight smothers Bellsprout, and it soon faints. Ash wins the battle, and has now cleared all four preliminary fields to advance through to the next round of competition.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

[[Officer Jenny]] and [[Nurse Joy]]\'s children.\n*** [[Marnie and Paige|The children]] of a Nurse Joy are indeed seen in [[DP028|a later episode]].\n* This episode marks the third appearance of [[James\'s Victreebel]]. In \'\'[[EP057|The Breeding Center Secret]]\'\', Victreebel\'s voice is low, but like in \'\'[[EP074|All Fired Up!]]\'\', its voice is extremely screechy and high-pitched in this episode.\n* In this episode, {{TRT}} uses a {{DL|Team Rocket mottos|Fourth Round Rumble motto|variation of their motto}}.\n* Team Rocket does not blast off in this episode.\n* This episode was banned in [[Pokémon in South Korea|South Korea]] due to Jeanette\'s Japanese clothing.\n* On its original airing in Japan, it was followed by a two-hour [[clip show]], [[It\'s the New Year! Pocket Monsters Special!]].\n* The dub of this episode aired the day after \'\'[[M01|Mewtwo Strikes Back]]\'\' premiered in the US.\n\n===Errors===\n* In one shot, {{an|Professor Oak}}\'s eyebrows change to large and gray.\n* In some airings of the episode, for a split-second during the cut between the commercial break and the first half of the "[[Who\'s That Pokémon]]" segment, the first quarter second of the Japanese "Dare Da?" segment can be seen. Though mostly obscured by the dubs whiteout transition effect, one can clearly make out the Japanese "Pocket Monster" logo in the lower right-hand corner.\n* When [[Jeanette Fisher|Jeanette]] commands her {{p|Scyther}} to use {{m|Slash}}, the next command was a dubbing error. In the dub, Scyther uses {{m|Quick Attack}}. In the original Japanese version, it was {{m|Swift}}.\n* Jeanette\'s {{p|Beedrill}} used {{m|Tackle}}, which Beedrill [[Anime move errors|cannot legally learn]] in the {{pkmn|games}}.\n* When the screen pans horizontally across the central flame, the stadium shifts repeatedly.\n* Just after {{AP|Pikachu}} uses {{m|Thunderbolt}} on {{p|Bellsprout}}, the zigzag mark is missing from under one of Ash\'s eyes.\n* {{m|Double Team}} and {{m|Vine Whip}} in the blurb are both lowercase.\n* In the {{pmin|Poland|Polish}} dub, the title states that the fourth round is the fifth instead.\n\n<gallery>\nEP077 error.png|Professor Oak\'s eyebrows\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[Pikachu\'s Jukebox]]: {{so|Viridian City}}\n* When {{Gary}} loses and bids farewell to {{Ash}} in the original, he talks about not being smiled upon by the goddess of fortune and that his girls\' tears are the only award he needs. In the dub, he talks about being distracted by their cheering but reassures them they will get over it.\n* Ash asks Pikachu if they should drop out in the dub, but in the original version, he simply wonders if he can win.\n* When Officer Jenny commands her {{p|Growlithe}} to use {{m|Flamethrower}}, she incorrectly refers to it as Arcanine in the dub, and its cry is also identical to the Arcanine in the previous episode. However, this error is corrected in Castilian Spanish dub.\n* In the dub, {{an|Misty}} says that she doesn\'t know whether it was more surprising for her that Ash chose to use {{AP|Muk}} or the fact that he thought ahead, while in the Japanese version, she says that she had thought that Ash was an idiot and commends him on having a strategy.\n* Team Rocket concludes the episode with a fast food-themed version of their motto in the dub. In the original, the motto is unchanged until the last two lines.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=AAFFAA|bordercolor=FFAAAA\n|zh_cmn={{tt|草之場地意外的強敵|Unexpected Rival of the Grass Battlefield}}\n|cs={{tt|Napínavý čtvrtý zápas|The tense fourth match}}\n|da={{tt|Drama I Fjerde Runde|Drama In Fourth Round}}\n|nl={{tt|Het Vierde Ronde Gerommel|The Fourth Round Rumble}}\n|fi={{tt|Kuuma neljäs kierros|The hot fourth round}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Quatrième tour décisif|Decisive fourth round}}\n|de={{tt|Hopp oder Top - Die Runde 4|Hopp or Top - round 4}}\n|he=הסיבוב הרביעי {{tt|\'\'Ha\'sivuv ha\'revihee\'\'|The Fourth Round}}\n|hi=चोथा राऊंन्ड हुआ शुरू! {{tt|\'\'Chautha Round Hua Shuru!\'\'|The Fourth Round Starts!}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n|hu={{tt|A negyedik forduló küzdelmei|The Struggles of the Fourth Round}}\n|it={{tt|Una nuova vittoria|A new victory}}\n|no={{tt|Fjerde rundes oppgjør|Showdown in the fourth round}}\n|pl={{tt|Huczna runda piąta|Sumptuous fifth round}}\n|pt_br={{tt|O Difícil Quarto Turno|The Hard Fourth Round}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|O Quarto Assalto|The Fourth Round}}\n|ro={{tt|A Patra Rundă|The Fourth Round}}\n|ru={{tt|Перипетии четвёртого раунда|Sinuosities of Fourth Round}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡La cuarta ronda, tiembla!|Fourth round, it shakes!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|La sonada cuarta ronda|The famed fourth round}}\n|sv={{tt|Fjärde ronden|The fourth round}}\n}}\n{{-}}\n\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP076 |\nprevtitle=Fire and Ice |\nnextcode=EP078 |\nnexttitle=A Friend In Deed |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Kanto| }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0077}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|077]]\n[[Category:Banned episodes]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Yukiyoshi Ōhashi]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded and directed by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Masaaki Iwane]]\n[[Category:Pokémon League episodes]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Ash]]\n\n[[de:Hopp oder top – Die Runde 4]]\n[[es:EP079]]\n[[fr:EP077]]\n[[it:EP077]]\n[[ja:無印編第77話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第78集]]'}
