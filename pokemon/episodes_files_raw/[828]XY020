It first aired in Japan on March 20, 2014 and in the United States on June 7, 2014.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/17_20-breaking-titles-at-the-chateau/-->\n<i>On their way to Cyllage City, our heroes meet Nico and Chester, two brothers who introduce them to the incredible Battle Chateau. Its owner, Lord Turner, explains that the Trainers who battle there are considered knights and expected to adhere to the knight’s code of chivalry and honor. By defeating others at the Battle Chateau, a Trainer receives a title of nobility—from the lowly Baron to the acclaimed Grand Duke.\n\nNico has already earned his Baron title, and he wants to introduce Chester to the Chateau. First, though, he’s looking for a battle of his own—and when his Fletchinder defeats Baron Farrell and his Dusknoir, Nico earns the new title of Viscount! Next, Chester and Ash face off in their debut battle. Chester’s Fletchling makes a valiant effort, but Pikachu is triumphant, and Ash is now a Baron!\n\nGym Leader (and Duchess) Viola also frequents the Battle Chateau, and after snapping a photo of Ash in his new Baron cape, she receives a challenge of her own. Duke Grant, with his powerful Onix, and Duchess Viola, with her speedy Surskit, take the battlefield—but thanks to some impressive training, Onix manages to keep up with Surskit, and Grant wins, earning the highest title of Grand Duke!\n\nAfterward, Ash is determined to advance through the Battle Chateau ranks so he can challenge Grant someday, but it seems that may not be necessary—because Grant is the Gym Leader of Cyllage City, our heroes’ next stop!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAt a [[Pokémon Center]], {{an|Serena}} shows her friends a picture of the [[Battle Chateau]], and suggests that they go there. They are approached by two brothers, the older with {{p|Fletchinder}} and the younger with a {{p|Fletchling}}; who explain that one gets noble ranks by battling at the Chateau. The brothers invite {{Ash}}\'s group to accompany them to the Battle Chateau, and introduce themselves; [[Nico]] is with Fletchinder and  [[Chester]] is with Fletchling. The group reaches the Chateau and are impressed with its elegance. Nico hold the rank of {{tc|Baron}} and requests a debut battle for Chester, and Ash asks to have a battle as well. The group is met by the head of the house, [[Turner]], who explains that the Battle Chateau is a social meeting place for gentlemen and ladies to have first-rate battles. A [[Pokémon Trainer]], or "knight" climbs through the noble ranks by winning battles. A {{tc|Maid}} guides the group to the salon, where they are to choose their opponent of the same rank. The group sees [[Grant]] hanging from the wall.\n\nNico finds a battle partner in another Baron named [[Farrell]]. The Chateau\'s occupants come to the terrace to watch the match. Coming to the terrace, [[Viola]] waves to Grant and notices Ash. On the battle field, Nico and Farrell wear white cloaks, and Turner tells the children the Chateau is based on chivalry. Chester explains the ranks: first, Baron (white), then {{tc|Viscount}} (blue), {{tc|Earl}} (green), {{tc|Marquis}} (yellow), {{tc|Duke}} (red), and finally {{tc|Grand Duke}} (purple). Nico needs only one more victory to have ten and be promoted to Viscount.\n\nThe battle begins; Nico using Fletchinder and Farrell using {{p|Dusknoir}}. Fletchinder begins with {{m|Flame Charge}} but Dusknoir vanishes, only to reappear suddenly and attack Fletchinder with {{m|Thunder Punch}}. Fletchinder uses Flame Charge again and is successful. Viola says hello to Ash, and tells him that she has a {{tc|Duchess}} rank. The Maid declares Nico the winner of the match, and he is given a new blue cloak and is promoted to Viscount. Just then, Grant crashes to the ground, and he and Viola exchange banter. Ash asks Grant for a battle, but as Grant is a Duke, they cannot. However, Turner announces that Ash and Chester will battle for the Baron rank, Ash decides to use {{AP|Pikachu}} and Chester sticks with Fletchling.\n\nAsh starts the battle with {{m|Thunderbolt}}, which Fletchling dodges with {{m|Agility}}. Ash follows up with {{m|Electro Ball}}, which again fails to land. Fletchling uses {{m|Feather Dance}}, which lowers Pikachu\'s attack power, and hits with a {{m|Steel Wing}}. Pikachu counters with {{m|Iron Tail}}, but is not effective because of its decreased strength, but is more effective when Ash uses it repeatedly. Ash uses Thunderbolt again, causing Fletchling to faint and winning the battle, as well as a white cloak and the title of Baron.\n\nViola begins to take a picture to commemorate Ash\'s victory when white gloves are draped over her shoulder, the sign for a battle request, this one from Grant. On the battle field, the Maid announces that both Viola and Grant need only one more victory each to reach {{tc|Grand Duchess}} and Grand Duke. Viola brings out {{p|Surskit}} and Grant releases {{p|Onix}}. Viola begins with having Surskit turn the field into ice for speed, and Grant, expecting the strategy, uses {{m|Rock Tomb}}. Surskit manages to escape from the rocks with {{m|Bubble Beam}} and {{m|Protect}}. Surskit uses {{m|Signal Beam}} and is met by Onix\'s {{m|Flash Cannon}}. Onix uses {{m|Rock Polish}} to raise its speed. Surskit uses {{m|Ice Beam}} to freeze Onix\'s tail, but Onix breaks out of the ice by jumping. Onix uses Rock Tomb once more and finishes Surskit with another Flash Cannon, and wins the battle.\n\nAs Grant leaves the Chateau, Ash and his friends catch up with him and tell him that they hope to battle with him. Grant says he thinks he will meet Ash in the [[Cyllage Gym|Cyllage City Gym]] soon, and looks forward to it. Ash resolves to train to stand up against Rock Tomb. Outside the Chateau, Ash and {{ashfr}} thank Nico and Chester, who wish Ash luck at his next [[Gym]]. Ash faces a new challenge at [[Cyllage City]].\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:Baron Ash.png|thumb|210px|Ash becoming a Baron]]\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
