It first aired in Japan on January 21, 2016 and in the United States on April 30, 2016.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/19_11-a-windswept-encounter/-->\n<i>In a beautiful meadow, Ash’s Noibat accidentally runs into a Breloom, who attacks with its poisonous spores! Clemont doesn’t have any medicine, but a passing Floette sees Noibat in distress and uses Aromatherapy to cure it.\n\nA sudden gust sends Floette flying, and Noibat takes off to rescue its new friend! The two are playing together when Breloom barges in with a bouquet for Floette and then gets angry when Floette isn’t interested. Noibat steps up to protect Floette from the unwanted attention—and then from Team Rocket! Soon, much more Floette drift by on the wind, and Noibat has to say goodbye as its friend continues its own journey.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}}, {{an|Serena}}, {{an|Clemont}} and {{an|Bonnie}} find a meadow and decide to take a break. They send out their Pokémon as well. As {{AP|Noibat}} and {{AP|Talonflame}} fly around, Ash reminds them not to fly too far. Meanwhile, a {{p|Breloom}} in the forest is drawing a {{p|Floette}} in the dirt. He is also holding a bunch of flowers and appears to have three {{p|Beedrill}} following him. Noibat flies through the forest and ends up running into Breloom. [[Squishy]] is sunbathing as usual, when Bonnie comes from behind and squishes it. The scene cuts back into the forest, and Breloom gets up. He looks around and finds his flowers ruined by Noibat. Noibat apologizes, but the Beedrill surround him and Breloom is furious. He uses {{m|Poison Powder}} and Noibat cries out. The gang hear him and have their Pokémon return to their Poké Balls. Then, they run into the forest and find Noibat {{status|poisoned}}. Clemont is out of [[Antidote]]s and [[Pecha Berry|Pecha Berries]] to cure Noibat\'s poison, and everyone starts to worry. However, a passing {{p|Floette}} floats down and uses {{m|Aromatherapy}} on the ailing Pokémon. Serena opens her [[Pokédex]] and scans Floette. Noibat is now healed of his poisoning.\n\n{{TRT}} is hiding in a tree, and [[Jessie]] remarks how Floette could be a sidekick with {{TP|Jessie|Gourgeist}} in a [[Pokémon Showcase]]. However, {{MTR}} wants the two to swap positions and [[James]] adds that Floette is cuter. Jessie then tells them off and says that Gourgeist is cuter. Serena reads from her Pokédex that many Floette gather around this time every year in the field. Suddenly, a gust of wind blows and Floette is blown up, and then starts to fall. Noibat catches her and plays with her. Breloom is very upset to see the two get along well. Clemont says that a {{type|Dragon}} Pokémon like Noibat shouldn\'t get along well with a {{type|Fairy}} Pokémon like Floette. Bonnie tells him to \'lighten up\'. {{AP|Hawlucha}} also agrees that Noibat and Floette are a great pair. Breloom and the Beedrill show themselves again. Serena then opens her Pokédex again and scans Breloom. Breloom orders Beedrill to harrass Noibat. He tries to fly away, but they follow them. Noibat is so terrified of the Beedrill\'s sharp stingers that he falls and Floette floats to the ground. Breloom begins to confess his feelings to Floette. Bonnie tells the gang that Breloom has a crush on Floette, leaving them appalled. He reveals his new bouquet of flowers. Serena now understands that he didn\'t like Noibat and Floette acting so friendly.\n\nHowever, Floette turns away, disinterested. Then, Breloom is angry again and pulls her back. Bonnie realizes that Floette doesn\'t like him. As Breloom walks away, Ash notices that Noibat wants to save Floette. Noibat rushes in to attack, but Breloom easily dodges and Noibat flies into a tree. Floette is worried, but Noibat gets up to face Breloom again. This time, Breloom orders the Beedrill to stay out of the scene as he challenges Noibat to a one-on-one battle, deciding to put Floette at stake. Serena tells Ash to stop them, but he says he can\'t do anything. Breloom starts with {{m|Seed Bomb}}, which Noibat counters with {{m|Supersonic}}. However, he could not see Breloom following up with {{m|Headbutt}} in the smoke and was hit. Noibat gets back up but is tossed into the air by Sky Uppercut. {{AP|Pikachu}} wants to help Noibat, but Hawlucha stops him. Ash says that Noibat must take Breloom on all by himself. Team Rocket is still up in the tree. Jessie wonders what the gang is doing. Meowth tells her that there is a battle that they are watching. Jessie reminds them that they must execute their plan. Noibat charges at Breloom again, but still missed. Then, Breloom approaches with {{m|Cut}}, but Noibat manages to dodge him. Ash cheers him on as Noibat attacks Breloom on the leg. However, Breloom stretches himself to grab onto Noibat and charge with Headbutt. Noibat is badly hurt and close to fainting. As Breloom prepared for another strike, Floette stops him. Breloom doesn\'t want her interfering with their battle, but they end up trapped in a net. Team Rocket reveal themselves and say their motto.\n\nBreloom struggles in the net, but Team Rocket moves off and disappears in a cloud of smoke. The Beedrill and Noibat begin to worry, but Ash says that they will rescue Breloom and Floette. Clermont reveals another one of his machines, which he calls the Aroma Detector. It looks like a {{p|Probopass}} attached to a sensor. Bonnie stares at him blankly and asks if it will blow up. Clemont responds with confidence that there won\'t be an explosion. The machine picks up a scent and points to a direction, in which everyone heads toward. Breloom furiously shakes the cage as Team Rocket celebrate their victory. Meowth starts to think about them failing again, but James and Jessie tell him to be happy for them. Floette looks out sadly, and Breloom attempts to court Floette again, failing as he did before. As the gang get closer, the machine begins to heat up. Eventually, it explodes and everyone is covered in dust. Bonnie says that she knew that that would happen. Ash asks Noibat to use Supersonic to find Breloom and Floette, and Noibat starts flying towards a direction. The gang follows and the scene cuts to Team Rocket still celebrating. Then, James says that they will give their efforts to the boss and they were excited about getting a big promotion. When they notice Ash and the gang, they get startled and demand them to stop ruining their victory. Ash says that they won\'t get away with it, and Serena tells them to let Breloom and Floette go.\n\nJames sends out {{TP|James|Inkay}}, using {{m|Psybeam}} and knocking out the Beedrill. Noibat and Bonnie rush to take care of Breloom and Floette. Then, Jessie sends out Gourgeist, using Seed Bomb. Ash tells Pikachu to counter with {{m|Electro Ball}} and Hawlucha uses {{m|X-Scissor}}. Then, Inkay charges up to use Psybeam again. Clemont sends out {{TP|Clemont|Luxray}} to use {{m|Swift}}. Meanwhile, Noibat attempts to push into the cage to break Breloom and Floette out. However, the cage isn\'t dented at all and Noibat falls to the ground. Noibat goes for another strike but fails again. Another hit and the cage still isn\'t broken. Bonnie wants Noibat to stop before he hurts himself. However, Noibat flies up and strikes with his newly learned move, {{m|Acrobatics}}. The cage is broken and Team Rocket is shocked. Breloom hands Floette to Noibat. Inkay and Gourgeist are called for a double, powerful attack. However, before they could charge, Ash orders Noibat to attack with his newly learned Acrobatics. Breloom also rushes in with Headbutt, sending Team Rocket blasting off again. Ash and Hawlucha then praise Noibat. The Beedrill return to Breloom, as he finally gets on good terms with Noibat.\n\nLater that evening, Breloom attempts to court Floette once more, but when he is rejected, he pulls her back again. Noibat comes in to stop them, and they argue once again. Ash and Serena see the argument and say that Breloom can\'t let go of Floette. Suddenly, another gust of wind blows. Floette is blown away and gives her farewell to the gang. Breloom is confused and distressed, and the gang notices that Floette has joined a big group of other Floette. Serena remarks that this was the group of Floette that visit the flower field once a year. The gang then say their farewell, and Breloom is now really upset. Hawlucha comes to cheer him up, and Ash suggests that they continue their journey to [[Snowbelle City]].\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
