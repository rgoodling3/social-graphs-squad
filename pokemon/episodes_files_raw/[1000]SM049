It first aired in Japan on November 9, 2017, in New Zealand on March 1, 2018, and in the United States on March 29, 2018.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/21_06-mission-total-recall/-->\n<i>After accidentally seeing Gladion and coming face-to-face with Silvally, Lillie is once again unable to touch Pokémon—but she’s determined to change that! With Nebby’s help, she embarks on a journey to recall the memories behind her fear. But Faba wants none of it, having been responsible for Silvally’s creation in the first place. Vowing to make sure Lillie never remembers her past, Faba captures her, and she’s again filled with fear. But Silvally rescues Lillie, and when she remembers that it was the one who saved her in the past, her fear of touching Pokémon finally vanishes!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{an|Lillie}} writes in her diary about the events of the [[SM048|previous episode]] and how she is now afraid to touch [[Snowy]]. During nightfall, {{an|Gladion}} confronts {{Ash}} on the beach over what happened with Lillie and {{p|Type: Null}}. Ash tries to apologizes for Nebby\'s actions but Gladion won\'t listen. Returning to his motel room, Gladion is met by {{an|Faba}} who has heard what happened to Lillie. He has come to retrieve {{p|Type: Null}}, claiming that these are {{an|Lusamine}}\'s wishes. Gladion refuses, leading to a battle between their Pokémon but Gladion is soon defeated. {{p|Hypno}} prevents Gladion from sending Type: Null out by using {{m|Hypnosis}} on Gladion. Faba takes the [[Premier Ball]] from Gladion. \n\nAsh and {{ashcl}} are supportive towards Lillie over what happened when {{an|Professor Kukui}} and [[Professor Burnet]] join them. Another attempt at making contact with Snowy causes Lillie to freeze. When school ends, Ash joins Lillie and Snowy as they walk home. As they walk, Lillie guesses that Ash has met with Gladion which shocks Ash but subsequently confirms. Lillie reveals what happened when she encountered Gladion and Type: Null. Ash tries to cheer Lillie up which helps and Lillie decides to remember everything that happened. As a result of that, {{DL|Light trio (anime)|Solgaleo|Nebby}} starts {{m|teleport}}ing them to various locations from Lillie\'s past, which brings back memories of her and her family. Soon, Nebby teleports them to the research area underneath [[Aether Paradise]]. In his lab, Faba places the [[Premier Ball]] containing Type: Null in a drawer and is alerted to the presence of Ash and Lillie from the security system.\n\nWalking around, Lillie recalls that she has been here before and are spotted by {{TRT}}. At Lusamine\'s house, Gladion confronts Lusamine over what Faba said to him but she tells Gladion that she didn\'t tell Faba to retrieve Type: Null. She remembers that Faba reported Type: Null to be a failure and asks Gladion to tell her what he knows. Faba is instructing Team Rocket to bring Lillie to him so he can make her forget the memories she\'s remembered but Team Rocket refuse and walk off. Ash and Lillie soon find themselves confronted by Hypno and {{p|Alakazam}} who send Ash flying as Faba grabs Lillie and takes her away. Gladion and Lusamine search for Type: Null\'s Poké Ball in Faba\'s lab and as soon as they find it, an alarm sounds. Faba has Hypno start to erase Lillie\'s memories only to be stopped by {{AP|Pikachu}}.\n\nNebby protects them from Hypno\'s Hypnosis as the battle continues. Alakazam takes Lillie into the air as Gladion and Lusamine arrive. Gladion sends out Type: Null who breaks free of its mask, turning into {{p|Silvally}}. Silvally frees Lillie from Alakazam, which causes Lillie to recall more memories. She remembers that Silvally had previously saved her from {{DL|Ultra Beasts (anime)|Nihilego}} and that Faba was there when it happened. With help from the [[Dark Memory]], Silvally is able to defeat Faba with {{m|Multi-Attack}} as Lusamine apologizes to Lillie. Lillie thanks Silvally and finds herself now able to touch Pokémon again.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
