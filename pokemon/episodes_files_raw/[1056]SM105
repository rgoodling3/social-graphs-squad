It first aired in Japan on January 20, 2019 and in the United States on May 11, 2019.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/22_13-showdown-on-poni-island/-->\n<i>When Hapu learns that Ash wants to battle Tapu Fini for his Poni Island grand trial, she lectures him about the true meaning of a grand trial, and Mudsdale backs it up with a tremendous kick! Ash goes flying and lands near Gladion, who’s also come to challenge the Island Guardian.\n\nThe two rivals decide to battle each other instead, in a Lycanroc showdown: Gladion’s Midnight Form versus Ash’s Dusk Form! Hapu reluctantly agrees to be the referee, and as the battle continues, she begins to understand Ash’s determination. After Gladion wins, Tapu Fini makes an appearance, and our heroes wonder if it will listen to their request…</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashcl}} continue to prepare their individual projects on [[Poni Island]]. {{an|Kiawe}} has his {{TP|Kiawe|Marowak}} and {{TP|Kiawe|Turtonator}} practice some {{pkmn|battle}} techniques. {{an|Sophocles}} is in the middle of strengthening {{TP|Sophocles|Charjabug}} before he [[Evolution|evolves]] it, while {{an|Mallow}} scours the [[Seafolk Village]] markets for new ingredients and {{an|Lana}} does some [[fishing]] while she waits for [[Ida]] to arrive. Meanwhile, {{an|Lillie}} and [[Snowy]] are busy documenting the Pokémon that live on Poni Island.\n\nMeanwhile, Ash decides to challenge [[Hapu]], but he finds [[Ancient Poni Path|her home]] empty. Ash then sees [[Nurse Joy]] and asks if she knows where Hapu is. Nurse Joy replies that she might be at the [[Ruins of Hope]]. At the ancient ruins, Hapu is praying at the altar, hoping to hear [[Sofu|her grandfather]]\'s voice for guidance. Hapu declares that she wants to be the Poni [[Island Kahuna]] and does not understand why {{DL|Guardian deities (anime)|Tapu Fini}} has not ordained her into the role yet. Her pleas, however, remain unanswered. Meanwhile, Lillie spots a {{pkmn2|wild}} {{p|Trumbeak}} and takes a [[photography|photograph]] of it, followed by a {{p|Gumshoos}}, {{p|Pinsir}}, and a sleeping {{p|Granbull}}. Snowy runs off after sensing something, and leads Lillie to her older brother {{an|Gladion}}, who is training with his Pokémon.\n\nMeanwhile, Hapu returns to her {{p|Mudsdale}}\'s side disappointed to have not received any answer as the tide rises and covers over the entrance to the Ruins of Hope. As Hapu and Mudsdale head back home, Mudsdale steps on something and suffers sharp pain in its hoof. Ash makes his way through the [[Poni Breaker Coast]]\'s rugged terrain and soon sees Hapu clinging onto her bucking Musdale\'s tail as it cries in pain. Hapu is unable to explain Mudsdale\'s berserk behaviour, but Ash spots something in one of Mudsdale\'s front hooves. He orders {{AP|Pikachu}} to use {{m|Iron Tail}} and it dislodges a {{p|Corsola}} horn fragment from Mudsdale\'s hoof. Mudsdale is instantly relieved of its pain, and while Hapu is grateful for Ash\'s assistance she admits that she sad that she hadn\'t noticed the problem. Hapu then asks Ash how she can repay him. Ash instantly points to her [[Z-Ring]], but Hapu pulls her wrist away and exclaims that she received it from her grandfather. Ash says that he doesn\'t want the ring but a battle.\n\nOverlooking Seafolk Village, Lillie and Gladion talk among themselves. Gladion explains that he is hoping to challenge Tapu Fini in a [[island challenge|grand trial]]. Lillie immediately chuckles to herself and adds that Ash has the exact same idea. Gladion smirks, then he admits that he also wanted to visit Tapu Fini because it can supposedly allow a person to see a deceased loved one. He clarifies that he wishes to meet [[Mohn|their father]]. Lillie is shocked by the confession, then the wind suddenly picks up and blows her hat away. Gladion looks down as Lillie stares at him for a silent moment, then {{TP|Gladion|Umbreon}} returns Lillie\'s hat to her. Lillie recalls that their father passed away in an accident while researching [[Ultra Wormhole]]s. Gladion admits that he doesn\'t remember the details because he was quite young, and only recalls his father patting him on his head. Lillie confesses that she only knows their father\'s face from photographs, and never asked {{an|Lusamine}} about him. Gladion remains hopeful that Tapu Fini will recognize his strength as a {{pkmn|Trainer}} and grant him his prayers. Lillie perks up and offers to battle Gladion to help summon Tapu Fini, and Gladion agrees to the idea.\n\nAsh follows Hapu and her Mudsdale on foot, and again asks her for a match. Hapu knocks back his offer and states that she doesn\'t battle for fun. Ash asks why she battled him the [[SM104|previous day]], and Hapu explains that she thought Ash was a radish thief. Hapu tells Ash that he could just battle his classmates. Ash explains that he wishes to go up against many different Trainers to help him prepare for his grand trial against Tapu Fini. Hapu is immediately infuriated and scolds Ash for not knowing what a grand trial actually is. She tells him to cleanse himself before having Mudsdale kick Ash, Pikachu and {{Rotom}} away. Ash lands in the middle of Gladion and Lillie, who are about to start their battle. Gladion and Ash are shocked to see each other, and Ash goes on to explain that Hapu\'s Mudsdale kicked him after he asked for a battle against her. He goes on to call Hapu "stubborn", but she overhears the snide remark and chases him around on her Mudsdale. Lillie calls for the pursuit to end, allowing Ash to catch his breathe. Lillie then formally introduces herself and Gladion to Hapu, who is immediately impressed by Lillie\'s good manners. Hapu spots some holes in Gladion\'s clothing and asks if she can mend it for him, though he dismisses her request and goes on to ask Ash for a battle. Lillie is fine with the idea and thinks that the heated match will help summon Tapu Fini. Ash pleads with Hapu to stay and watch the battle, though she is none too pleased. Gladion then asks Ash if they can have a battle between their {{p|Lycanroc}}, and Ash is immediately excited by the prospect.\n\nHapu declares herself the [[battle judge]]. She then sees [[Ash\'s Lycanroc]]\'s unusual orange coat, and Rotom explains that it is a Dusk Form Lycanroc. Hapu frowns and wonders who Ash is, she then calls for the one-on-one battle to begin. Ash has his Lycanroc make the first move, an {{m|Accelerock}}. Gladion orders his {{TP|Gladion|Lycanroc}} to {{m|Counter}} the attack. The two Lycanroc engage is tense confrontation before being sent backwards, with Ash\'s Lycanroc flying into a nearby cliff. Gladion is surprised that Ash\'s Lycanroc withstood the damage and immediately recognizes its unusual strength, Ash has his Lycanroc charge forward with another Accelerock. It leaps onto the rock cliffs to launch its attacks, but Gladion\'s Lycanroc evades several times. Ash then calls for a {{m|Bite}} attack, but Gladion\'s Lycanroc jumps up and forces its opponent to the ground. Gladion is glad to see that Lycanroc has improved since [[SM047|last time they battled]] and Ash admits that {{DL|Guardian deities (anime)|Tapu Bulu}} [[SM075|helped Lycanroc to overcome its fear of dirt]]. Hapu is immediately taken aback by the confession and remains determined to learn who Ash really is. She turns to Lillie and declares that the ongoing battle is far different from anything she has ever witnessed. Lillie states that she has learned a lot from Ash, and informs Hapu that the role of an Island Kahuna helps to bring out a Trainer and their Pokémon\'s strength.\n\nThe battle continues, and Ash\'s Lycanroc lands a successful {{m|Stone Edge}} on its opponent. Gladion has his Lycanroc power up with {{m|Swords Dance}} and strike back with {{m|Outrage}}. Ash calls for another Accelerock, and it clashes several time with Lycarnoc\'s Outrage attack. The two trade blows before Ash has his Lycanroc attempt a Bite attack to stop Gladion’s Lycanroc from moving. Lycanroc pre-empts the strategy and swats Ash\'s Lycanroc away. Whila Ash\'s Pokémon looks battered, Gladion\'s Lycanroc is afflicted with {{status|confusion}} because of its exhaustive Outrage attacks. Ash used the delay to perform Lycanroc\'s exclusive [[Z-Move]], {{m|Splintered Stormshards}}. The overpowered move lands on Gladion\'s Lycanroc, but when the dust clears Lycanroc remains standing. Rotom goes on to explain that the Z-Move also helped Gladion\'s Lycanroc to snap out of its confusion. Gladion then reveals his new [[Dragonium Z]] and has Lycanroc perform {{m|Devastating Drake}}. The winged dragon of energy strikes Ash\'s Lycanroc, taking it out of the fight, and Gladion is officially declared the winner of the match.\n\nAsh rushes over to his Lycanroc, and is relieved to see that it well considering its defeat. Gladion and his Lycanroc fist-bump each other. Ash then declares that he will catch up to Gladion and win next time, and Gladion smiles in response. Hapu continues to consider the intense battle she had just witnessed. Suddenly, everyone hears a [[cry]] overhead and it turns out to be Tapu Fini. The island deity flies over the group, almost foreshadowing a brighter future for them all.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
