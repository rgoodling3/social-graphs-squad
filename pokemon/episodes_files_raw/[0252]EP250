It first aired in Japan on May 30, 2002, but was not aired anywhere else outside of Asia. This episode is the fourth episode of the anime series to be [[Banned episodes|banned]], following [[EP018]], [[EP035]], and [[EP038]], and the only Johto League episode to suffer that fate.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Plot==\nAs they continue their {{pkmn|journey}}, {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} go through the [[Ice Path|Ice Cave]], a shortcut to [[Blackthorn City]]. However, they suddenly slip and fall into a hole dug by {{TRT}}. Team Rocket then starts putting water in the hole. [[Ash's Pikachu]] uses {{m|Thunderbolt}} and [[Misty's Politoed]] uses {{m|Water Gun}}, sending Team Rocket blasting off. When they finally get out of the hole, {{an|Brock}} catches a cold. As they walk along, they find a [[Pokémon Center]] with {{p|Jynx}}. As they check Brock's temperature, he becomes feverish because of [[Nurse Joy]], who explains that she is the sister of the Nurse Joy who appeared in ''[[EP092|The Joy of Pokémon]]''. Later, Joy explains that the ice cave remains stable due to a large building acting as a refrigerator.\n\nMeanwhile, Team Rocket, overlooking the Pokémon Center from a nearby cliff, complains about the cold draft. They leave to find its source and soon come upon the large building Joy described. They set about their evil deeds as the scene cuts back to Brock in the Pokémon Center. Brock continues to dream of Nurse Joy, and mistakenly shares a kiss with Jynx as she cares for him. Nurse Joy notices a rapid rise in cavern temperature, and goes to the building with Ash and {{an|Misty}} to investigate. All three travel by sled driven by {{p|Piloswine}}. Upon their arrival, the trio sees that the structure has been reversed, heating the cave and cooling the jungle outside. This puts both sides in danger, so the group runs outside to find the cold air pipe, but immediately falls into a pitfall dug by Team Rocket.\n\nTeam Rocket tells Ash, Misty and Joy their plan to steal the {{type|Ice}} Pokémon before running off. The group climbs out of the hole with help from {{AP|Bayleef}}. Knowing they have to get the pipe back in the cave, Ash commands Bayleef to use {{m|Vine Whip}} to grab the pipe. They then pull on Bayleef's vines as hard as they can, and the pipe is restored to its original place. The scene cuts to Brock lying in bed in his sickly state, and he gets up out of bed. He notices Team Rocket outside the Pokémon Center, and they have set up a bunch of heaters to weaken the Ice Pokémon there. They scoop up all the {{p|Swinub}} and Piloswine there, and then, Jynx appears. She attempts to stop them, but {{TRT}} points a heater right at her, and Jynx collapses.\n\nBrock, in his weakened state, appears to confront Team Rocket. Brock sends out his {{TP|Brock|Geodude}}, while Jessie sends out her {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}}. Geodude uses {{m|Tackle}}, but this has no effect on Arbok, and the snake Pokémon retaliates using {{m|Headbutt}}. Geodude is sent flying into Brock, and [[Jessie]] commands Arbok to use {{m|Wrap}} on both of them. Arbok wraps them with its tail and slams them into the ground. Brock has been defeated, and Team Rocket proceeds to steal Geodude. Just then, Ash, Misty and Joy appear. Misty and Joy tend to Brock, while Ash takes care of Team Rocket. He sends out {{AP|Totodile}}, and Jessie once again uses her Arbok, and James sends out {{TP|James|Victreebel}}. Misty joins in too, and she sends out her {{TP|Misty|Corsola}}. She commands it to use Tackle, and James, under attack from Victreebel, is sent flying. Meanwhile Totodile uses {{m|Bite}} on Arbok. Jessie then sends out {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}}. Corsola uses Headbutt on Wobbuffet, but he uses {{m|Counter}} and sends Corsola flying. Totodile uses {{m|Water Gun}} on Wobbuffet, but he counters this too and Totodile and Corsola are defeated.\n\nMeanwhile, the cold air enters the battleground. Pikachu then uses {{m|Thunderbolt}} on the heaters, and the Ice Pokémon are revitalized. Jynx and Piloswine use {{m|Blizzard}} on Team Rocket. Joy commands Jynx to use {{m|Lovely Kiss}} on Wobbuffet. For their final effort, Joy commands Jynx and all the Piloswine to use Blizzard at full power, instantly freezing Arbok, Victreebel, and Wobbuffet. Pikachu then delivers the final blow using {{m|Thunder}}, blasting off Team Rocket. Later, Nurse Joy thanks Ash and company for helping her to save the Ice Pokémon, and Brock's fever is now gone. Ash, Misty, Brock and Pikachu leave Joy and the Ice Cave Pokémon Center. They have now arrived at the end of the Ice Cave, and they come across {{ci|Blackthorn}} Lake. Brock informs Ash and Misty that Blackthorn City is on the other side of the lake, and our heroes rush towards Blackthorn City and Ash's final Johto League Gym Badge.\n\n==Major events== \n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n=====TV episode debuts=====\n* {{p|Furret}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]] (×2; one in photo)\n* {{an|Giovanni}} ([[Boss fantasy|fantasy]])\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:PMTV EP250.png|thumb|200px|{{tt|Pocket Monster TV|Who's That Pokémon}}]]\n[[Who's That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Jynx}} (Nurse Joy's)\n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Togepi}} ({{OP|Misty|Togepi}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Bayleef}} ({{OP|Ash|Bayleef}})\n* {{p|Totodile}} ({{OP|Ash|Totodile}})\n* {{p|Politoed}} ({{OP|Misty|Politoed}})\n* {{p|Corsola}} ({{OP|Misty|Corsola}})\n* {{p|Geodude}} ({{OP|Brock|Geodude}})\n* {{p|Arbok}} ({{OP|Jessie|Arbok}})\n* {{p|Victreebel}} ({{OP|James|Victreebel}})\n* {{p|Jynx}} ([[Nurse Joy]]'s)\n* {{p|Swinub}} ([[Nurse Joy]]'s; multiple)\n* {{p|Piloswine}} ([[Nurse Joy]]'s; multiple)\n* {{p|Chansey}} ([[Unnamed island (EP092)|Orange Islands]] {{OP|Nurse Joy|Chansey}}; photo)\n* {{p|Weedle}}\n* {{p|Pidgey}} (×2)\n* {{p|Vileplume}}\n* {{p|Mankey}}\n* {{p|Primeape}}\n* {{p|Weepinbell}}\n* {{p|Exeggutor}}\n* {{p|Furret}}\n* {{p|Spinarak}}\n* {{p|Aipom}}\n* {{p|Stantler}}\n\n==Banning==\n[[File:Jynx original design.png|thumb|250px|Jynx in its original design]]\nThis episode was [[banned episodes|skipped in the dub]] because of the prominence of {{p|Jynx}}, whose design at the time was considered by some, most significantly in the {{wp|United States}} to be an offensive racial stereotype. Jynx had appeared in previous episodes and another [[AG013|future episode]] in this design, but 4Kids were able to cut Jynx's appearance, as those deletions did not significantly affect the storyline of those particular episodes. That was not the case with this episode, as Jynx is one of the main characters in this episode, and 4Kids knew it would be impossible to remove Jynx entirely for this episode and still have the story make sense. As a result, 4Kids eventually decided to skip the episode completely. Also, three previous episodes (''[[Holiday Hi-Jynx]]'', ''[[EP090|Stage Fight!]]'', and ''[[EP099|The Mandarin Island Miss Match]]'') that were originally dubbed and aired normally, were later removed from [[Pokémon TV]] and the re-release of [[List of English language Adventures in the Orange Islands home video releases (Region 1)|the Orange Islands DVD box set]] because of this controversy. Jynx would not appear again in a dub episode until ''[[AG115|Mean With Envy]]'', where it finally appeared in the redesign it was given due to the complaints leveled against it.\n\n{{pmin|Greater China|Taiwan, Hong Kong}}, and {{pmin|South Korea}} are among the only areas outside of Japan to have aired the episode, as Asian dubs are based on the original Japanese version.\n{{-}}\n\n==Trivia== \n* The Ice Cave in this episode is not named こおりのぬけみち ''Ice Path'', as it is in the games, though its location as the gateway to [[Blackthorn City]] indicates that it is indeed the [[Ice Path]].\n* In this episode, {{TRT}} uses a {{DL|Team Rocket mottos|The Ice Cave! motto|variation}} of their motto.\n* This is the first episode to use music from ''[[M04|Celebi: The Voice of the Forest]]'', at the very end of the episode.\n* An instrumental version of ''[[Face Forward Team Rocket!]]'' is used as background music.\n* Music from ''[[PK01|Pikachu's Vacation]]'' can be heard in this episode.\n* The [[Nurse Joy]] from ''[[EP092|The Joy of Pokémon]]'' is seen in a photograph in this episode, and is said to be the elder sister of the nurse in charge of the Pokémon Center in the Ice Cave.\n* This was the last episode to be banned in the English dub until [[SM064]], 753 episodes later.\n\n===Errors===\n* Although {{Ash}}, {{an|Misty}}, and {{an|Brock}} were all soaked-up with water, they were not affected by the electricity from {{AP|Pikachu}}'s {{m|Thunderbolt}}.\n* {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} uses {{m|Counter}} to deflect {{m|Water Gun}}, when it should have been {{m|Mirror Coat}}.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|zh_cmn={{tt|冰之洞窟|The Ice Cave}}\n|ko={{tt|얼음 동굴의 포켓몬을 지켜라!|Defend the Ice Cave Pokémon!}}\n}}\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP249 |\nprevtitle=I Politoed Ya So! |\nnextcode=EP251 |\nnexttitle=Beauty is Skin Deep |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Johto }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0250}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|250]]\n[[Category:Banned episodes]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Yukiyoshi Ōhashi]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded and directed by Hiroaki Shimura]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Hiroaki Shimura]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Hiroaki Shimura]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Yumenosuke Tokuda]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Nurse Joy]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Brock]]\n\n[[de:Kōri no Dōkutsu!]]\n[[es:EP252]]\n[[fr:EP250]]\n[[ja:無印編第250話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第251集]]"}
