It was first broadcast in Japan on February 25, 1999 and in the United States on February 5, 2000. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/02_31-fit-to-be-tide/-->\n<i>Ash, Misty and their new friend, Tracey, are on a new adventure exploring the Orange Islands as Ash sets out to qualify for the Orange League Tournament. After hearing that the Mikan Gym Leader is known as one of the toughest trainers in the Orange Crew, Ash can\'t wait for the challenge. He learns that Pokémon battles are run a little differently on the Orange Islands, but he can always rely on his Squirtle to pull them through!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nWhile riding {{AP|Lapras}} across the ocean, a hungry {{Tracey}} says they are getting close to [[Mikan Island]], which is also home to one of the four [[Gym Leader]]s in the Orange Crew. Meanwhile, {{TRT}}, now in a {{p|Magikarp}} [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|submarine]], is tracking them, but their submarine\'s propellers gets tangled in seaweed and they begin to sink.\n\nUpon reaching the shoreline, the group heads straight for the [[Pokémon Center]]. There, {{Ash}} talks to {{an|Professor Oak}} via videophone and lets him know he recently {{pkmn2|caught}} a Lapras. Tracey officially introduces himself to Oak, though the call is cut short as [[Ash\'s Muk]] smothers the Professor. Ash, {{an|Misty}}, Tracey, {{AP|Pikachu}}, and {{TP|Misty|Togepi}} walk along the dirt path and see [[Mikan Gym]] up ahead. Ash starts to run towards the Gym, though he stops after seeing a coconut on the ground. He runs over to it with Pikachu and picks it up, but a bucket of water falls on their heads, revealing it to be a trap set by a boy named {{OBP|Senta|EP085}}. He chastises Ash and criticizes his Top 16 position in the [[Indigo League]]. He challenges Ash to a {{pkmn|battle}}, but [[Cissy]], his older sister and the Mikan Gym Leader, intervenes and scolds her younger brother.\n\nAsh is prepared to have a match, but Cissy explains that on the Orange Islands, the Gym battles are different from Kanto\'s Pokémon battles. Senta presses the buttons on his remote, making a line of cans appear, and the battlefield becomes an aquatic pool. Cissy proceeds to call out her {{p|Seadra}}, which Ash scans with his [[Pokédex]]. She announces that the first challenge is a {{m|Water Gun}} match-up, where a Pokémon\'s accuracy is tested by shooting down as many cans as possible. [[Ash\'s Squirtle]] proves to be an even match against Seadra, and the aim of the challenge shifts to shooting down flying plates. Both are evenly matched and manage to hit the final target at the same time. Cissy declares the first challenge a draw, and Ash congratulates Squirtle\'s efforts while Seadra turns away in disgust.\n\nCissy escorts Ash and {{ashfr}} to outside the Gym. To break the tie, Ash will go up against Cissy in a Pokémon Wave Ride, where the aim is to swim out to a flagged buoy and return to the beach first. Cissy calls on her {{p|Blastoise}}, while Ash sends out his Lapras. Before the race can begin, however, Team Rocket appears. When Ash asks that they disappear, [[James]] launches into a tear-filled confession about how he had to go out and untangle their submarine, nearly drowning in the process. {{MTR}} calls for James to focus, and James follows suit by calling out {{TP|James|Weezing}}. Amongst Weezing\'s {{m|Smog}}, Team Rocket nets Cissy\'s Blastoise and begins to dive back underwater, only to find that their submarine\'s propellers are still entangled in seaweed. In a bid to push through, Team Rocket snaps their pedals and their submarine sinks to the seafloor again. Just as Cissy had predicted, her Blastoise proves to be too powerful for Team Rocket\'s net, and it returns to the beach. Pikachu dips his tail in the water and uses {{m|Thunderbolt}} to shock Team Rocket, while Blastoise sends the trio blasting off with its {{m|Hydro Pump}}.\n\nWith Team Rocket defeated, the Pokémon Wave Ride begins. However, Ash and Cissy must stand on their Pokémon\'s back. During the race, they are evenly matched, so Ash has Lapras nudge the competition, but Blastoise responds, causing Ash to nearly lose his balance. The delay allows Cissy to get ahead of him, and she makes the turn around the flag first. As Ash catches up with Cissy, the pair notices a tidal wave suddenly appearing behind them. To Ash\'s surprise, Lapras freezes some of the wave with its {{m|Ice Beam}}. However, the wave still crashes into Cissy and sends her flying, but Blastoise catches her in time. Cissy once again gets ahead, but Ash comes up with an idea and has Lapras use an Ice Beam to make an ice-track. Lapras proves to be faster on the ice than in the water, allowing Ash to barely win the race.\n\nCissy commends Ash\'s clever Ice Beam tactic, and notes that she can see why he made it so far into the Indigo League. In commemoration of his victory, she gives Ash a {{badge|Coral-Eye}}. Afterwards, he and his friends ride away aboard Lapras.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

In the dub, however, all characters improperly pronounce Mikan, which should properly be "mee-khan," not "mike-an."\n* {{Ash}} seemed to not recognize {{p|Seadra}} when first seeing it, despite having previously seen one in \'\'[[EP075|Round One - Begin!]]\'\'.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[Pikachu\'s Jukebox]]: [[Together Forever]]\n* [[Cissy]]\'s brother {{OBP|Senta|EP085}} is left unnamed in the dub.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FFDDAA|bordercolor=FFBB55\n|zh_cmn={{tt|橘子聯盟夏干道館|Xiàgàn (Mikan) Gym of the Orange League}}\n|cs={{tt|Nebezpečné vlny|Dangerous tides}}\n|da={{tt|På bølgelængde|On (the same) wavelength}}\n|nl={{tt|Een Wedstrijd op Zee|A Match on Sea}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Un match très serré|A very tight match}}\n|de={{tt|Wettkampf der Wasser-Pokémon|Competition of the water-Pokémon}}\n|he=מוכן לניצחון {{tt|\'\'Mukhan le\'nitzakhon\'\'|Ready for victory}}\n|hi=Ash ने जीता पेहला बॅज! {{tt|\'\'Ash ne jeeta pehla badge!\'\'|Ash won the First Badge!}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n|hu={{tt|A rózsakorall jelvény|The Rose Coral Badge}}\n|it={{tt|Una nuova Medaglia|A new Badge}}\n|no={{tt|På bølgelengde|On the Wavelength}}\n|pl={{tt|Niespodziewany przypływ|Sudden high tide}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Maré de Sorte|Tide of Luck}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Preparado para Onda|Ready for Wave}}\n|ro={{tt|La Fix Pentru Ce Trebuie|Just In Time For What Is Needed}}\n|ru={{tt|Созданный для волн|Created for waves}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Duelo en la marea!|Duel in the tide!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Nacido para navegar|Born to navigate}}\n|sv={{tt|Simtävlingen|The swimming contest}}\n}}\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP084 |\nprevtitle=The Lost Lapras |\nnextcode=EP086 |\nnexttitle=Pikachu Re-Volts |\nseries=Original series |\nepisodelist=List of original series episodes |\ncolorscheme=Orange }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0085}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|085]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Yukiyoshi Ōhashi]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded and directed by Osamu Inoue]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Osamu Inoue]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Osamu Inoue]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Shin\'ichirō Kajiura]]\n[[Category:Episodes with Gym battles]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which Ash gets a Badge]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Ash]]\n\n[[de:Wettkampf der Wasser-Pokémon]]\n[[es:EP087]]\n[[fr:EP085]]\n[[it:EP085]]\n[[ja:無印編第85話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第86集]]'}
