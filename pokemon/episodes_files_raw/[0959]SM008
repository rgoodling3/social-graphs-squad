They soon realize someone will need to take the Egg home after school—and Mallow suggests Lillie! Lillie is stunned for a moment but soon steps up, hoping to get over her fear of touching Pokémon.\n\nAsh helps Lillie take the Egg to her house, which is an enormous mansion with its own battlefield. She’s distracted when Ash challenges her butler to a battle, and when she returns to the Egg, it’s being threatened by a hungry Salandit. Without a second thought, Lillie throws her arms around the Egg to protect it—a great first step!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAt the [[Pokémon School]], the Pokémon are all playing. {{TP|Sophocles|Togedemaru}} becomes more active and ends up rolling into Pikachu before jumping back into the air and ends up hitting {{Ash}} and {{an|Kiawe}}. Togedemaru ends up rolling towards a petrified {{an|Lillie}} but {{an|Mallow}} moves her out of the way. Togedemaru eventually calms down as {{an|Professor Kukui}} arrives and says they have to see [[Samson Oak]] for his special class. In Samson Oak\'s office, he shows the class two {{pkmn|Egg}}s. One Egg is the one that Ash brought with him from [[Kanto]] whilst the other was found on [[Mount Lanakila]]. Samson Oak suggests the class that they look after one of the Eggs whilst he looks after the other. Professor Kukui says they\'ll learn a lot from it as it is good experience. Samson Oak gives them the chance to chose which Egg to raise and Lillie picks the white Egg because off the design.\n\nMallow offers Lillie the chance to touch it saying that Eggs aren\'t able to move but as Lillie goes to touch it, the Egg moves. They discuss what to do at night as they can\'t leave it in the classroom. They all agree to take it home with them. Mallow suggests they let Lillie do it to help her to touch Pokémon. Lillie agrees to give it a go as a {{p|Salandit}} watches the activity.  School ends and they all go their separate ways. Ash promises to make sure the Egg and Lillie get home safe. A limousine pulls up to the school to drive Lillie and Ash to her home. Arriving at the house, they are met by her butler [[Hobbes]]. Hobbes requests that Pikachu remains outside but Lillie says they came home with her so Pikachu can go in. After apologizing for his mistake, Hobbes explains they don\'t normally allow Pokémon inside as they tend to scare Lillie.\n\nLillie explains they built a playground in the garden for Pokémon so she could watch from a safe distance. Lillie shows Ash to her room where Lillie thinks it is a good idea to place the Egg on the sofa and after checking a book on Eggs, she places three cushions on the sofa to make it comfortable. Ash notices a picture on a nearby desk showing a younger Lillie holding a {{p|Lillipup}} and wonders why she is now afraid to touch them. Lillie can\'t remember what happened to change her mind. Hobbes isn\'t sure of the facts but at one point but knows that when Lillie resided with {{an|Lusamine|her mother}}, she came back, scared of Pokémon. Hobbes explains the people in the picture with Lillie are her mother and {{an|Gladion|brother}}. One of her maids come in with tea and macarons and they start to eat. Whilst eating, Ash suggests to Lillie they start practicing to allow her to touch Pokémon again.\n\nThey make several attempts, starting with Pikachu before trying with a sleeping {{AP|Rowlet}}. Neither attempt succeeds so they decide to try with Rotom which doesn\'t work either. At that moment, a {{p|Butterfree}} flies past the balcony. Lillie explains wild Pokémon often fly past the balcony and goes to get some food and they have different food for every Pokémon. Ash has a look out in the garden and sees lots of Pokémon are out there playing. At the front door, a Maid opens the door to find Mallow and {{TP|Mallow|Bounsweet}} who has come to check on Lillie. Wathing the Pokémon play, Ash notices a battlefield as Hobbes says it is kept right so it can be used at anytime and Ash is keen to have a battle but lacking an opponent, Lillie suggests Hobbes as he is one of the best battlers among the staff.\n\nLillie watches from the balcony as Ash and Hobbes start their battle. Ash decides to battle with Rowlet as Hobbes sends out his {{p|Oricorio}}. Rotom provides Ash with data on Oricorio and the battle begins with but Rowlet is hit by {{m|Revelation Dance}}. Rowlet gets up and uses {{m|Tackle}} but Oricorio uses {{m|Mirror Move}}, causing the attacks to collide. Another Tackle and Mirror Move collide as Ash has Rowlet send Oricorio with another Tackle. Rowlet tries to attack before Oricorio uses Revelation Dance but Oricorio dodges and fires its attack which Rowlet dodge. Lillie heads inside to check on the Egg. The battle continues with Oricorio confusing Ash, Pikachu, Rotom and Rowlet with {{m|Teeter Dance}} allowing Rowlet to be sent flying and lands on Mallow.\n\nHaving been worried about Lillie, Mallow came over only for Lillie\'s scream gets their attention. The Salandit is approaching the Egg trying to take it as Lillie backs away scared. Salandit jumps in the air to attack but Lillie guards the Egg bravely as the others arrive. Seeing the Salandit, Rotom provides Ash with information. Salandit goes to attack but Ash orders Pikachu to use {{m|Quick Attack}} as Oricorio uses Teeter Dance to confuse it before Rowlet sends it flying with Tackle. Salandit retreats as the others check on Lillie and notice she is actually touching the Egg. She realizes her attempts to protect the Egg helped conquer her fear but is still scared about touching Pikachu.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:Lillie Egg.png|thumb|220px|Lillie\'s new Egg]]\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
