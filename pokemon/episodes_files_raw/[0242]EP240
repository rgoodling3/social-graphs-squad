Getting the Hot Heart!!\'\') is the 240th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on March 14, 2002 and in the United States on March 29, 2003. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/05_31-some-like-it-hot/-->\n<i>Ash, Misty, and Brock face many roadblocks on the path to success, some metaphoric and others in the form of gigantic Magcargo that refuse to step aside and let a traveler pass. When Misty\'s Water tactics fail to move the stubborn Fire Pokémon, a passing trainer taunts her, declaring that Fire Pokémon, his specialty, are far superior to Water. Their rivalry escalates into a full-on Pokémon battle, from which Misty emerges victorious. The Fire Pokémon trainer doesn\'t hold a grudge for too long, though, and in the end an unlikely collaboration between Fire and Water reopens the path to the Johto League.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nThe group make their way through some rugged terrain. {{an|Misty}} complains about the increasing heat. {{an|Brock}} points out that there are volcanoes and hot springs around, which doesn\'t please Misty at all. Meanwhile, {{TRT}} are relaxing in the hot springs when {{MTR}} spots {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} walking passed. However, [[Jessie]] and [[James]] return to their relaxation, declaring that the [[twerps]] are the reason for their stresses. A huge geyser suddenly erupts beneath the Rocket trio, sending them into the air.\n \nLater, Misty and Ash get into an argument because of the heat. When a {{p|Magcargo}} appears, Ash checks his [[Pokédex]] for information on it. Brock then notices more Magcargo around them. Misty remains irritated and urges her friends along, and eventually the group finds a cooler place. They continue through a narrow mountain pass until they come across a sleeping Magcargo blocking the road. Ash yells at it to move out of the way. As a result, Magcargo wakes up in a foul mood and aims a {{m|Flamethrower}} at them. The group manages to duck in time to avoid the flames, and Magcargo returns to its nap. Ash decides to battle it, but Misty tells him that she\'ll handle it instead because a {{type|Fire}} like Magcargo is weak against a {{type|Water}}. She is about to send out {{TP|Misty|Staryu}} when her {{TP|Misty|Psyduck}} comes out instead. Psyduck approaches Magcargo and wakes it up. Psyduck is intimidated by Macgargo\'s rage and rushes behind Misty\'s legs for safety. Misty is annoyed and calls out her {{TP|Misty|Poliwhirl}} to douse Magcargo with a {{m|Water Gun}}. Magcargo immediately withdraws into its shell to avoid the water. When it emerges, it retaliates with a {{m|Rock Slide}}. Poliwhirl evades the attacks Magcargo throws at it, but it fails to avoid the Flamethrower attack. \n\nA young boy appears and makes fun of Misty\'s battle techniques. Misty gets angry at him. The boy declares that he is going to jump off the cliff, although he seems reluctant to do so. When he eventually jumps off, he lands flat on his face. After recovering from his fall, Misty yells at him for making fun of her earlier, but he insults her more. The Magcargo slithers away and the boy blames Misty for that. Misty angrily asks for his name and the boy introduces himself as [[Egan]], the Prince of Fire. Misty proceeds to introduce herself as the Water Princess. The two gets into an argument and end up challenging each other to a battle. However, Egan states that he has to chase after Magcargo and rushes off to catch it. Misty yells out at Egan that he doesn\'t have a chance of catching Magcargo with his Fire Pokémon. Though Ash admits that at least Magcargo has finally moved out of their way. Elsewhere, Team Rocket, while talking about their refreshing day, gets blasted off again when another geyser hits their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|balloon]]. \n\nStill sore about Egan, Misty keeps on complaining about him. All of a sudden, Misty and her friends spot Egan coming out of a cave. He asks the group if they saw Magcargo, but Misty replies with sarcasm. Magcargo then appears and Egan sends out his {{p|Flareon}} to battle it. Flareon starts off with a Flamethrower, but Magcargo {{m|Withdraw}}s into its shell before following up with a Rock Slide attack. Flareon uses {{m|Quick Attack}} to evade the falling rocks. Egan orders another Flamethower, but Magcargo once again withdraws into its shell. Magcargo sears Flareon with its own Flamethrower. It prepares to land a Body Slam, and Misty tells Flareon to dodge it. Egan tells her to stay out of his battle and orders Flareon to attack with a Flaming {{m|Tackle}}, which fails. Magcargo then knocks Flareon down. Seeing how badly weakened Flareon is, Misty suggests to call it back, but Egan refuses to listen to her. He orders Flareon to attack once more, but Magcargo counters its flames and finally knocks it out. Magcargo returns to the caves as Egan recalls Flareon back into its {{i|Poké Ball}}. Misty starts to make fun of Egan, and the two start an argument again. Brock suggests that they should eat. When Egan\'s stomach growls, Misty makes more fun of him. Team Rocket spies on the group from an overhead cliff. They set their sights on stealing {{AP|Pikachu}} and the twerps’ picnic lunch to fill their stomachs. Meowth then notices a sudden increase in temperature. The trio turns around to find Magcargo roasting their behinds with a Flamethrower, and they run away from the flames.\n \nDuring mealtime, Misty and Egan surprisingly start to get along. Misty offers Egan a cup of hot cocoa as Flareon enjoys some [[Pokémon food]]. Egan feels guilty for pushing Flareon so hard in battle and says that Flareon is very special to him. After agreeing to stop their rivalry, Egan asks why Misty loves Water types. Misty explains to him that Water Pokémon are very flexible and can easily adapt to any situation. Egan is quick to point out that Misty had no strategy earlier, and she retorts that she shouldn\'t be so nasty. Later, they encounter Magcargo again. Egan is prepared to challenge it with Flareon. Magcargo attacks with Rock Slide. Egan remembers Misty\'s advice on being adaptable and he has Flareon dodge the rocks. Egan orders Flareon to use Flamethrower. Magcargo withdraws into its shell again, but this time Egan makes sure not to perform any reckless moves. Flareon Tackles Magcargo into the cliff, causing the [[wild Pokémon]] to emerge from its shell a bit shaken. A final Flamethrowers seals the deal, and Magcargo is knocked out. Egan throws out a Poké Ball, and after a few anxious moments Magcargo is officially caught.\n\nEgan’s celebrations are short-lived when Team Rocket steals the Poké Ball using a giant arm. The trio perform their {{motto}} with a baseball twist. Misty quickly sends out Poliwhirl and tells it to use Water Gun. Poliwhirl\'s Water Gun breaks the mechanical arm, releasing Egan\'s Poké Ball. Team Rocket are not done yet, and call out their Pokémon to attack. Egan sends out his Magcargo. {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}}\'s {{m|Poison Sting}} attack is taken care of by Poliwhirl\'s Water Gun and {{TP|James|Victreebel}}\'s {{m|Razor Leaf|Razor Leaves}} are singed by Magcargo\'s fire. After that, Poliwhirl and Magcargo combine their attacks, with the Flaming Water Gun utterly defeating Arbok and Victreebel. Pikachu then uses his {{m|Thunderbolt}} and sends Team Rocket blasting off. Before going their separate ways, Egan and Misty appear to have become friends and promise to have a battle again next time.\n\n==Major events==\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Magcargo}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n[[File:PMTV EP240.png|thumb|200px|right|{{tt|Pocket Monster TV|Who\'s That Pokémon}}]]\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Egan]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP EP240.png|thumb|200px|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Mantine}} \'\'(US and international)\'\', {{p|Magcargo}} \'\'(Japan)\'\'\n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Togepi}} ({{OP|Misty|Togepi}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Psyduck}} ({{OP|Misty|Psyduck}})\n* {{p|Poliwhirl}} ({{OP|Misty|Poliwhirl}})\n* {{p|Arbok}} ({{OP|Jessie|Arbok}})\n* {{p|Victreebel}} ({{OP|James|Victreebel}})\n* {{p|Flareon}} ([[Egan]]\'s)\n* {{p|Magcargo}} ([[Egan]]\'s; {{pkmn2|giant}}; new; debut)\n* {{p|Magcargo}} (multiple; debut)\n\n==Trivia==\n* This episode reveals why {{an|Misty}} loves {{type|Water}}s to the extent that she does.\n* The episode\'s title is a reference to the 1959 comedy film \'\'{{wp|Some Like It Hot}}\'\', starring {{wp|Marilyn Monroe}}. \n* In this episode, {{TRT}} uses a {{DL|Team Rocket mottos|Some Like it Hot motto|variation}} of their motto.\n** The motto may be a reference to the series \'\'{{wp|Star of the Giants}}\'\'.\n* Team Rocket is sent blasting off three times in this episode.\n\n===Errors===\n* After Team Rocket blasts off for the first time in the episode, Ash and his friends are walking in the heat when a Magcargo passes in front of them. When the group opens their eyes they turn around and see the Magcargo. It could have been the same Magcargo put in a different place by accident or it could have been a completely different Magcargo. This is up to the viewer\'s interpretation as it is not known if it is the same one.\n* On "[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]", {{p|Mantine}} is mentioned as the heaviest {{cat|Generation II Pokémon}}; however, it is actually second, the heaviest being {{p|Steelix}}.\n* When Misty is about to send out her Pokémon to fight the Magcargo that is blocking the path, she was originally going to bring out {{TP|Misty|Staryu}}. After {{TP|Misty|Psyduck}} runs back to Misty, she throws the same {{i|Poké Ball}} that she had in her hand from before, but {{TP|Misty|Poliwhirl}} comes out instead.\n* The second time that Team Rocket blasts off, they were in their Hot Air Balloon, but it was gone when the geyser blasted them into the sky.\n* The third time that Team Rocket blasts off, Wobbuffet can be heard, despite being in his Poké Ball at the time.\n* When Poliwhirl is battling Team Rocket, it fires its Water Gun downards. It is later seen being fired upwards.\n** However, the ground could have deflected it.\n* A Magcargo which has been using {{m|Flamethrower}} on Team Rocket is a smaller size.\n* In one scene when Misty commands Poliwhirl to use {{m|Water Gun}}, her eyes are green.\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|bg={{tt|Някои го предпочитат горещо|Some Like it Hot}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|熔岩蝸牛，用火熱的心來收服！|Magcargo, Use the Hot Heart to Capture!}}\n|de={{tt|Manche mögen´s heiß!|Some like it hot!}}\n|nl={{tt|Als Je van Heet Houdt|If you like it hot}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Certains l\'aiment chaud !|Some like it hot!}}\n|he=חם כמו אש{{tt|kham kmo esh|Hot as fire}}\n|it={{tt|Rivalità|Rivalry}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Quanto mais Quente Melhor|The Hotter the Better}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Quanto mais Quente Melhor|The Hotter the Better}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡A algunos les gusta el calor!|Some like the heat!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|A algunos les va el calor|Some like the heat}}\n|pl={{tt|Czasem bywa gorąco|Sometimes it\'s hot}}\n|hi=किसी को गर्मी पसंद है {{tt|\'\'Kisi ko Garmi pasand hai\'\'|Some Like the heat/warmth}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP239 |\nprevtitle=Whichever Way the Wind Blows |\nnextcode=EP241 |\nnexttitle=Hocus Pokémon |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Johto | }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0240}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|240]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Shōji Yonemura]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Toshiaki Suzuki]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Izumi Shimura]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Misty]]\n\n[[de:Manche mögen\'s heiß!]]\n[[es:EP242]]\n[[fr:EP240]]\n[[ja:無印編第240話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第241集]]'}
