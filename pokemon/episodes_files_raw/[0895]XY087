The Spoiled {{tt|Chigoras|Tyrunt}}!!\'\') is the 87th episode of the {{series|XY}}, and the 886th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on September 10, 2015, in Canada on October 24, 2015, and in the United States on October 31, 2015.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/18_38-the-tiny-caretaker/-->\n<i>Team Rocket has gotten their hands on a little Tyrunt, with plans to get it to evolve into a powerful Tyrantrum. It manages to escape by jumping from their balloon into a river, where it gets stuck in some rocks. Bonnie finds it and frees it, and the two of them begin to bond, while their friends watch in amazement. But Clemont can’t quite understand what a Tyrunt would be doing out there in the wild...\n\nDetermined as ever, Team Rocket grabs Tyrunt, Bunnelby, Dedenne, and Bonnie! Everyone soon gets free, and Bonnie comes up with a fun plan to defeat the hapless trio. A fierce battle ensues, Tyrunt evolves into Tyrantrum, and it’s blast-off time once again!\n\nWhen Bonnie learns that Tyrantrum comes from the Pokémon Fossil Research Lab and already has a Trainer, she sadly realizes that it can’t travel with her. Tears are shed as Bonnie says goodbye to her new friend, but she promises to come back someday for a visit, and our heroes’ journey continues.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAt night, {{TRT}} kidnaps a sleeping {{p|Tyrunt}}, but it wakes up while [[Jessie]], [[James]], and {{MTR}} are in their hot air balloon trying to escape. Jessie introduces the trio to Tyrunt as its Trainers. Tyrunt responds by using {{m|Fire Fang}} on Jessie, thus destroying her hair. The Team Rocket balloon becomes unsteady and Tyrunt falls into a river. The scene cuts to {{Ash}} and {{Ashfr}} sleeping in their tents. {{an|Bonnie}} wakes up thirsty, and she grabs her water bottle to find there is no water in it, thus she goes to the lake and refills her bottle. She finds the Tyrunt stuck between two rocks and helps get it unstuck, but both fall into the water. The hood of Bonnie\'s Tyrantrum pajamas falls over her face, and Tyrunt looks at her intently.\n\nAt daybreak, Bonnie wakes up {{an|Clemont}}, who is surprised to see Tyrunt. Ash confirms Tyrunt\'s identity on the Pokédex. Tyrunt quickly warms up to Bonnie, who begins taking care of it - gently scolding it for misbehavior, brushing its fur collar, feeding it, cleaning its teeth and teaching it manners. {{an|Serena}} remarks that Bonnie is taking care of Tyrunt like a parent would for her child, while Clemont notes that Tyrunt must have became interested in Bonnie since she\'s wearing her Tyrantrum pajamas. Later, Tyrunt plays hide-and-seek with Bonnie, {{AP|Pikachu}}, [[Clemont\'s Dedenne|Dedenne]] and [[Clemont\'s Bunnelby|Bunnelby]] with holes Bunnelby dug. As they run down a dirt path, Tyrunt suddenly falls into a pit trap; Bonnie, Dedenne and Bunnelby are quickly trapped in a net as well trying to get it out. Team Rocket pulls them up with their balloon, and before Ash and the others can give chase James covers their escape with a smokescreen.\n\nIn a clearing, Bonnie defiantly declares that Tyrunt and her are now friends and refuse to cooperate with Team Rocket. As she and Team Rocket argue, Tyrunt uses its strength to break free, and all of them manage to escape with Bunnelby digging out an escape tunnel too small for Team Rocket to pursue them through. Later, Bonnie and the Pokémon mess with Team Rocket using a bunch of freshly dug holes and playing the hide-and-seek game from earlier, wearing Team Rocket out. As Tyrunt tires out, the group takes a break and have a drink alongside a river. Bonnie expresses her wish for Tyrunt to travel together with her. Team Rocket shows up again, and the group runs into a nearby cave to hide. Meanwhile, [[Ash\'s Noibat]] and {{AP|Talonflame}} continue to search for Bonnie.\n\nEmerging into the open, Bonnie and the others help Tyrunt scale a rock formation, thinking they\'ve escaped Team Rocket, only for the villains to show up. James sends [[James\' Inkay|Inkay]] in for a {{m|Tackle}} which Bunnelby intercepts with its {{m|Wild Charge}}, but Jessie orders [[Jessie\'s Gourgeist|Gourgeist]] to tie it up with {{m|Leech Seed}} and defeats Bunnelby with {{m|Seed Bomb}}. Dedenne also gets knocked out by Inkay\'s {{m|Psybeam}}. Team Rocket grabs Tyrunt with a retractable claw from their balloon and takes off. Bonnie grabs on trying to free Tyrunt, but Team Rocket deploys another claw to pull her off and flings her. Bunnelby and Dedenne are horrified as Bonnie plummets through the air. Agitated by this, Tyrunt [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Tyrantrum}} and breaks free with its increased strength, catching Bonnie and landing safely. From afar, two {{tc|Scientist}}s in a jeep witness the evolution, and Bonnie\'s friends catch up to her. Ash scans Tyrantrum on his Pokédex. Annoyed, Team Rocket deploys another claw and chases them, trying to grab their Pokémon. At Bonnie\'s command, Tyrantrum bites through the new claw easily and sends Team Rocket blasting off with Fire Fang.\n\nBonnie begs Clemont to let her keep Tyrantrum, and Serena supports the idea since Bonnie bonded so well with Tyrunt. Clemont relents, but as he tosses a Poké Ball it collides with Tyrantrum and fails to activate. Bonnie wonders if the Ball is broken, but Clemont uneasily explains that the Poké Ball failed to work because Tyrantrum already has a Trainer. The scientists, driving up to the group, confirm this, explaining that they and Tyrantrum come from the Pokémon Fossil Research Lab. They thank the group for taking care of Tyrantrum; the others point out that Bonnie solely took care of it. The scientists invite the group to visit the lab as thanks. Bonnie, knowing that parting ways with Tyrantrum is inevitable, remains silent.\n\nAt the lab, Clemont and Ash are excited to see live {{p|Aerodactyl}} and {{p|Kabuto}}, while Bonnie continues to sulk. The scientists finally bring the group to the Tyrunt and Tyrantrum enclosure where all the other specimens are living in one happy group. Clemont and Serena gently inform Bonnie that it\'s time to say goodbye. Relenting, Bonnie gives Tyrantrum one final brushing, reminding it to be on its best behavior and giving the brush to the scientists, telling them that Tyrantrum loves having its fur brushed. Unable to hold it in, Bonnie runs to Serena, crying. Tyrantrum walks up to her, saying goodbye, and Bonnie manages to send it off with a smile. The group leaves the laboratory as the episode ends, with Bonnie promising to visit Tyrantrum one day, knowing that they\'ll always be friends.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
