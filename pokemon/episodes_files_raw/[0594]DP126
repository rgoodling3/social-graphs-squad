It first aired in Japan on May 7, 2009 and in the United States on October 3, 2009.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/12_21-classroom-training/-->\n<i>Zoey welcomes our heroes to her hometown, Snowpoint City, the site of Ash’s next Gym battle. The welcoming committee doubles when Candice joins the group—she’s Zoey’s friend and the Gym Leader that Ash hopes to battle! Candice also teaches at the Pokémon Trainer School where she and Zoey were once students; before she battles Ash, she wants to show him off to her special class for older Trainers. This special class includes Jeremiah, a Pokétch company employee who wants to travel with his Skuntank, and the members of Team Rocket in disguise.\n\nOnce Ash and Dawn are introduced, Candice starts the class with a quick-fire quiz challenge. Both Ash and James think they’ve got this in the bag, but Jeremiah beats them both! Ash may have the badges, but Jeremiah isn’t impressed by his quiz challenge performance. While Ash grumbles, Zoey tells Dawn all about how she met her Glameow on a cold night before she was old enough to be a Pokémon Trainer. Zoey insisted on raising Glameow no matter what, but the school’s principal, Mr. Honcho, insisted that Candice help her out. The two agreed to each focus on one area: Zoey concentrated on Contests, while Candice pursued Gym battles.\n\nBut all this time, Team Rocket has been focused on stealing the school’s stored Pokémon. They’ve overpowered Mr. Honcho, grabbed the school’s Poké Balls, and are about to make a clean getaway! Jeremiah and Skuntank try to stop them, but Team Rocket has Jeremiah’s Skuntank on the ropes. Candice and our heroes arrive in the nick of time; Ash and Buizel help rescue Skuntank, while Candice and her Abomasnow tackle Team Rocket. Our heroes foil Team Rocket once again, showing Jeremiah that Ash is a great Trainer after all and quiz results aren’t everything! Ash will take on Candice in a Gym challenge tomorrow—is he great enough to earn his next badge?</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{incomplete plot}}\n{{cleanup}}\nUpon reaching [[Snowpoint City]], {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} are welcomed by the [[Gym Leader]] of the [[Snowpoint Gym]], [[Candice]]. The group accepts her offer to show them around the city; the first place they are lead to is a {{pkmn|academy|Trainers\' School}} where Candice works as a teacher. Happily Candice shows Ash and his friends to her school. Candice appears already with her sweater tied on her waist. Candice soon begins off with a quiz. Ash is then asked about the secret of his success as a Trainer. He answers that "The best defense is offense", but he is suddenly faced with a quiz. He doesn\'t even know the answer to the question about {{AP|Pikachu}} because he says a wrong answer before Candice had finished the question. However, there is a quite knowledgeable businessman named [[Jeremiah]] who can answer to all questions with amazing speed. After the test, he says that Ash is not clever enough, but {{an|Brock}} comforts him, saying that he is great at Gym Battles. Later, Ash meets [[Zoey]] and Candice at a small shed where the two girls used to play together. Zoey then reveals that she met her {{TP|Zoey|Glameow}} when she was too little to raise a [[Pokémon]]. Due to this she and Candice decided to raise Glameow until she was of age to train it.\n\nMeanwhile, {{TRT}} sneaks into a storage room in the school and they begin to steal all the Pokémon stored at the school. When Jeremiah arrives to get back the [[Poké Ball]]s, [[James\'s Carnivine]] immobilizes his {{p|Skuntank}} with {{m|Vine Whip}}. At the moment [[Jessie\'s Seviper]] is about to attack, Pikachu comes to the rescue and knocks it out. After Team Rocket reveal themselves, Candice and Ash team-up to defeat them. With the help of the {{m|Blizzard}} attack of Candice\'s {{p|Abomasnow}} and {{AP|Buizel}}\'s improved Ice-Aqua Jet, Team Rocket blasts off again. Though afterwards, the Poké Balls start to fall from Team Rocket\'s trap, but {{TP|Dawn|Piplup}} collects them safely with {{m|Whirlpool}}. Seeing how Ash beat Team Rocket, Mr. Jeremiah apologizes for being rude. With all the Poké Balls safe and sound, Ash now concentrates on his upcoming Gym battle against Candice.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrive in [[Snowpoint City]] and meet up with [[Zoey]] again.\n* Ash and his friends meet [[Candice]], the Snowpoint City [[Gym Leader]].\n* Zoey is revealed to have earned her fourth {{pkmn|Contest}} [[Ribbon]].\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* [[Candice]]\n* [[Jeremiah]]\n* [[Mr. Honcho]]\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n=====TV episode debuts=====\n* {{p|Abomasnow}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Zoey]]\n* [[Candice]]\n* [[Jeremiah]]\n* [[Mr. Honcho]]\n* Teachers\n* Students\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Piplup}} ({{OP|Dawn|Piplup}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Mime Jr.}} ({{OP|James|Mime Jr.}})\n* {{p|Buizel}} ({{OP|Ash|Buizel}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Carnivine}} ({{OP|James|Carnivine}})\n* {{p|Glameow}} ({{OP|Zoey|Glameow}})\n* {{p|Chimchar}} ([[Zoey]]\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Abomasnow}} ([[Candice]]\'s)\n* {{p|Turtwig}} ([[Candice]]\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Skuntank}} ([[Jeremiah]]\'s)\n* {{p|Diglett}} (Snowpoint Trainer\'s School\'s)\n* {{p|Baltoy}} (Snowpoint Trainer\'s School\'s)\n* {{p|Stunky}} (Snowpoint Trainer\'s School\'s)\n* {{p|Lickilicky}} (Snowpoint Trainer\'s School\'s)\n* {{p|Cyndaquil}} (Snowpoint Trainer\'s School\'s)\n* {{p|Abra}} (Snowpoint Trainer\'s School\'s)\n* {{p|Chimchar}} (Snowpoint Trainer\'s School\'s)\n* {{p|Turtwig}} (Snowpoint Trainer\'s School\'s)\n\n==Trivia==\n* This episode marks the beginning of the four-part [[Snowpoint City]] arc.\n* There is no [[Professor Oak\'s Big Pokémon Examination]] following this episode, instead being replaced with a preview of the following episode of [[Pokémon Sunday]], which is due to make a [[n:Major Pokémon game to be announced this month|major game announcement]]. The advertisement is performed in the style of the lecture.\n* Even though it is stated that {{MTR}} is the only Pokémon that can learn {{m|Pay Day}}, other Pokémon can learn it through [[Generation I]]\'s TM16. A {{p|Skitty}} can also learn it through special events in [[Generation III]].\n* Background music from {{rt|29|Johto}}, [[Oldale Town]], the challenge theme of [[Team Rocket]], an instrumental version of [[A Small Thing]], and {{rt|210|Sinnoh}} were used in this episode.\n* One of [[Candice]]\'s students bears a striking resemblance to [[Vitzo]] from \'\'[[EP203|The Screen Actor\'s Guilt]]\'\'.\n* This is the first episode of the dub to be aired in 16:9 aspect ratio in US airings, as well as the first episode available in HD. In Japan, this change took place in \'\'[[DP121|The Lonely Snover!]]\'\'.\n* In this episode, {{TRT}} uses a {{DL|Team Rocket mottos|Classroom Training! motto|variation}} of their motto.\n\n===Errors===\n* {{an|Brock}} claims that [[Zoey]] and {{an|Dawn}} battled [[Fantina]], when it was really Zoey and Ash who battled her.\n** However, Dawn did ask Fantina for a battle, but her Pokémon had to rest at that point.\n* In multiple scenes, the top of {{p|Stunky}}\'s head is colored purple, instead of white.\n\n<gallery>\nDP126 error.png|Stunky\'s head\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FCC|bordercolor=99F\n|zh_cmn={{tt|訓練家培育學園的小菘老師！|Miss Candice of Trainers\' School!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|¡Clases de Entrenamiento!|Training Classes!}}\n|cs={{tt|Výuka ve třídě|Teaching in the classroom}}\n|da={{tt|På skolebænken!|In the classroom!}}\n|de={{tt|Blitz-Quiz mit Hindernissen!|Flash quiz with obstacles!}}\n|nl={{tt|Trainen in de klas!|Training in the Classroom!}}\n|fi={{tt|Teoria ja käytäntö!|Theory and practice!}}\n|it={{tt|Ritorno a scuola!|Return to school!}}\n|no={{tt|Klasseromstrening!|Classroom training!}}\n|pl={{tt|Klasowy trening|Classroom training}}\n|pt_br={{tt|A Sala de Aula!|The classroom!}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Treino Académico!|Academic Training!}}\n|es_la={{tt|Entrenemiento de salón|Classroom training}}\n|sv={{tt|Klassrums-träning!|Classroom training!}}\n|ro={{tt|Antrenament în Sala de Clasă|Classroom Training}}\n|ko={{tt|포켓몬 트레이너스쿨! 무청 선생님!|Pokémon Trainers\' School!
