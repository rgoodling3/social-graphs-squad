It was first broadcast in Japan on August 26, 1999 and in the United States on September 16, 2000. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/03_05-the-stun-spore-detour/-->\n<i>When a chance encounter with a Vileplume leaves Ash and Tracey incapacitated, Misty sets about finding a healing plant that will restore their health. Meanwhile James and Meowth of Team Rocket lurk nearby, planning to steal the herb for their own nefarious uses.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nWhile staying at {{OBP|Unnamed island|EP110|another island}}, {{Ash}} and {{AP|Pikachu}} prepare for the [[Orange League]]. After a wave crashes over the pair, they make their way over to {{Tracey}} to ask for assistance, but Ash trips on a stone, knocking both himself and Tracey into a {{p|Vileplume}}'s head opening. The two try to struggle to get free, but Vileplume uses a point-blank {{m|Stun Spore}} on them. Pikachu, unaffected, races back and soon finds {{an|Misty}}, who is busy walking with {{TP|Misty|Psyduck}}. Pikachu tries to explain, but it is after Ash and Tracey stumble over that Misty realizes the pair have been {{status|paralysis|paralyzed}}.\n\nAt the cabin, Misty struggles to cure Ash and Tracey, since they have no first aid aside from band-aids, and the nearest [[Pokémon Center]] is on another island. Tracey, in his weakened state, tells Misty to look at Ash's [[Pokédex]] for advice. She learns that boiled [[Salveyo weed]] has the ability to cure Vileplume's Stun Spore, and they are found on lake bottoms with {{p|Poliwag}} wherever Vileplume are found. Leaving Pikachu to take care of Ash and Tracey, Misty and {{TP|Misty|Togepi}} set out to find the Salveyo weed.\n\nMeanwhile, at another cabin, it is also revealed that Jessie was a victim to Vileplume's Stun Spore, after she dove headfirst into a field of flowers, right into a Vileplume's head opening. [[James]] quickly recalls that Salveyo weed can help cure her, and he and {{MTR}} set off to find the Salveyo weed. They manage to find a Poliwag with Salveyo weed stuck on its tail. James sends out {{TP|James|Victreebel}}, which attempts to hit Poliwag, but it jumps out the way and uses {{m|Water Gun}}. Victreebel absorbs the hit and retaliates with {{m|Razor Leaf}}. Meowth eventually jumps onto Poliwag and catches it with his weaved basket, but it soon escapes.\n\nAt the same time, Misty, having unsuccessfully searched several lakes for the Salveyo weed, encounters Poliwag. Poliwag warms up to Misty just as James and Meowth appear. James and Meowth demand the Poliwag, but Misty, seeing that Poliwag is hiding behind her, refuses. Seeing that Misty is outnumbered, James and Meowth proposition a {{pkmn|battle}}, which Misty accepts. However, the battle does not go well for {{TRT}}, with {{TP|Misty|Goldeen}} evading Victreebel's Razor Leaf before repeatedly juggling it with {{m|Fury Attack}}, forcing James to recall it. Then, {{TP|Misty|Staryu}} cuts through {{TP|James|Weezing}}'s {{m|Smog}} with {{m|Double-Edge}} and defeats it. Next, Meowth tries to {{m|bite}} Psyduck's head, causing it to unleash a headache-induced {{m|Confusion}}. Misty, who had managed to ask for Poliwag's help, walks away with Poliwag in tow.\n\nLater, Poliwag manages to get Misty the Salveyo weed, but it continues to follow her. As they walk back together, Misty tells Poliwag about her friends, all the while ignoring lures to pitfall traps left by James and Meowth. In a last-ditch effort, James disguises himself as an old lady and Meowth as a baby, hoping to appeal to Misty. However, after Meowth reacts uncharacteristically to James's tear-jerking story, Misty realizes the pair's true identities. James and Meowth recite their {{motto}}, then Meowth reveals that Jessie is suffering from a Vileplume attack, and James calls upon Weezing's assistance. Poliwag uses {{m|Double Slap}}, knocking Weezing into James and Meowth, and off a cliff. Much to the pair's surprise, Misty decides to leave some Salveyo weed for them afterwards, to help Jessie recover. On their way to Jessie, James and Meowth gush over Misty's kindhearted gesture.\n\nLater, both parties have recovered, and Jessie, believing that Ash and Tracey are still sick, decides to seize this opportunity to steal Pikachu. Jessie initiates the attack without James' and Meowth's support; Pikachu, in self-defense, lands a {{m|Thunder Shock}} on Arbok and Jessie, paralyzing them again. Not wanting another conflict, James and Meowth quickly cart Jessie and Arbok off. Afterwards, Ash thanks Misty for her efforts, but Misty acknowledges her new friend and team member, {{TP|Misty|Poliwag}}. Ash again thanks Misty for being nice, but she warns him not to expect it too often. The group soon leaves the island on {{AP|Lapras}} for Ash's upcoming [[Orange League]] championship match.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

She said that it was because of the tropical weather in the [[Orange Archipelago|Orange Islands]] made them adapt differently and have an {{shiny|alternate color}}. However, the Vileplume that stunned {{Ash}}, {{Tracey}}, and Jessie looked like the normal ones found in [[Kanto]] and elsewhere.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[Pikachu's Jukebox]]: [[2.B.A. Master]]\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FFDDAA|bordercolor=FFBB55\n|zh_cmn={{tt|蚊香蝌蚪和小霞！|Poliwag and Misty!}}\n|cs={{tt|Omračující pyl|Stunning pollen}}\n|nl={{tt|De Verdeelspooromweg|The Stun spore Detour}}\n|de={{tt|Stachelsporen-Chaos|Stun spore chaos}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Les algues salsifiques|Salsific algae}}\n|he=פרשיית אבקת השיתוק {{tt|''Parshiyat Avkat Ha'Shituk''|The case of the Stun Spore}}\n|hu={{tt|Az álomspóra-túra|The Sleep Spore Tour}}\n|it={{tt|L'alga curativa|The curative seaweed}}{{tt|*|Original 2000 dub}} <br> {{tt|Un'alga miracolosa|A miraculous seaweed}}{{tt|*|2014 K2 TV dub}}\n|pt_br={{tt|O Caso dos Esporos Paralizantes|The Case of the Stun Spore}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|O Desvio do Esporo de Atordoamento|The Stun Spore Detour}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡La desviación paralizadora!|The paralyzing detour!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|La espora paralizadora|The paralyzing spore}}\n|pl={{tt|Pyłkowa afera|Pollen affair}}\n|ro={{tt|Deturul Prafului Paralizant|The Stun Spore Detour}}\n|hi=स्टन स्पोरे का एंटीडोट {{tt|''Stun Spore ka Antidote''|The Antidote of Stun Spore}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}} \n}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP109 |\nprevtitle=The Wacky Watcher! |\nnextcode=EP111 |\nnexttitle=Hello, Pummelo! |\nseries=Original series |\nepisodelist=List of original series episodes |\ncolorscheme=Orange}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0110}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|110]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Yukiyoshi Ōhashi]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded and directed by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Masaaki Iwane]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a main character obtains a new Pokémon]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Misty]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on James]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Meowth]]\n\n[[de:Stachelsporen-Chaos]]\n[[es:EP112]]\n[[fr:EP110]]\n[[it:EP110]]\n[[ja:無印編第110話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第111集]]"}
