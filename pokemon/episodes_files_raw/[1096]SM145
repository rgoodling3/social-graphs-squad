It first aired in Japan on October 27, 2019<!-- and is scheduled to air in the United States on *day*-->.\n{{spoilers}}\n<!--\n==Blurb==\nOfficial Blurb from Pokémon.com goes here, with source link-->\n<!--Please do not alter the blurb to fix any errors, they are meant to be presented as they are on the official site.-->\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing his [[Manalo Conference]] victory, {{Ash}} returns home and enjoys breakfast with his Pokémon, {{an|Professor Kukui}}, and [[Professor Burnet]]. Suddenly, {{AP|Naganadel}} senses something, and its floats outside to see an open [[Ultra Wormhole]] overhead. Ash, {{AP|Pikachu}}, and {{Rotom}} all realize that it is time for Naganadel to return [[Poipole\'s world|home]]. Ash hugs Naganadel for one more time and thanks it for its assistance, and as a parting gift, Pikachu sends Naganadel off with a {{m|Thunderbolt}}. They then watch as Naganadel disappears into the wormhole, which then closes.\n\nLater, after school ends, Kukui asks his students about their holiday plans. {{an|Sophocles}} says he and his cousin [[Molayne]] will be traveling to [[Mossdeep City]] in [[Hoenn]] to visit the [[Mossdeep Space Center]]. {{an|Kiawe}} admits that he wants to battle Ash, as the pair didn\'t get to go up against each other during the Manalo Conference, but Ash accepts the challenge. {{an|Lana}} reveals that she will be assisting [[Lana\'s father|her father]] with his next ocean survey to find the [[Mythical Pokémon]] {{p|Manaphy}}. Still inspired by [[Oranguru\'s place]], {{an|Mallow}} plans to turn [[Aina\'s Kitchen]] into a restaurant for both people and Pokémon. Meanwhile, {{an|Lillie}} hopes to finally awaken {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Magearna}}. Ash, however, admits he hasn\'t given any thought to his next goal. As he and Kukui walk towards home, Ash reveals that he is now unsure of his next move, now that he completed the [[island challenge]]. He turns to Kukui for advice, but Ash is left dumbfounded when Kukui says that he just has to think about it for himself.\n\nThe following day, Mallow hosts a tasting party at Aina\'s Kitchen, where she unveils her first ever menu dedicated to Pokémon. While eating, Kiawe turns his attention to Ash, saying [[Olivia]] will be the [[Battle judge|referee]] for their match tomorrow. Sophocles asks Lillie about her progress with Magearna, though Lillie admits her attempts so far have failed. Ash and the others urge Lillie to continue on, certain her observation and empathy will get through to Magearna. That night, while studying [[Mohn|her father]]\'s notes on Magearna, Lillie hones in on Magearna\'s {{a|Soul-Heart}} component, giving it a zap of electricity and a polish in the hope of reawakening it, but to no avail. Lillie and [[Snowy]] eventually fall asleep beside Magearna. The next morning, they spot a page in Mohn\'s journal featuring a drawing of Magearna with {{p|Zoroark}} beside it.\n\nMeanwhile, Ash and Kiawe battle at the [[Ruins of Life]] on [[Akala Island]]. [[Kiawe\'s Charizard]] uses {{m|Fire Punch}}, knocking [[Ash\'s Lycanroc]] away. Ash orders Lycanroc to use {{m|Stone Edge}}, but Charizard flies upwards to avoid it before Kiawe calls for an {{m|Aerial Ace}}. As Charizard dives towards its opponent, Lycanroc runs up one of its Stone Edges and {{m|Bite}}s down on Charizard\'s tail. Charizard uses {{m|Slash}}, sending Lycanroc to the ground. With both sides visibly exhausted, Ash and Kiawe use their Z-Moves, which are launched simultaneously, though Lycanroc\'s {{m|Splintered Stormshards}} proves to be more powerful and combines with Charizard\'s {{m|Inferno Overdrive}}. The flaming meteoric shower hits Charizard, knocking it down. Lycanroc sneers at its fallen foe, but it soon collapses from its own exhaustion.\n\nAsh and Kiawe urge their Pokémon to get up, but neither side responds. Olivia prepares to rule the match a draw when Lycanroc suddenly rises up, thus awarding Ash the victory. Kiawe accepts his defeat, [[recall]]ing Charizard before thanking Ash for the match. Olivia is overwhelmed by their emotions, admitting the battle was awesome. She then asks the boys about their next plans on becoming stronger. Ash admits he still has to figure that out, though Kiawe declares his intent to complete his island challenge, master new kinds of Z-Moves, and become an [[Island Kahuna]] like [[Kiawe\'s grandfather|his grandfather]]. Olivia advises Kiawe that he will need to know about the outside {{pkmn|world}} for a broader perspective, as does Ash.\n\nThat evening, {{an|Gladion}} checks on his younger sister Lillie as she continues to intensely focus on reawakening Magearna. Lillie apologizes for the short notice, admitting that she wanted have Zoroark to meet Magearna. Gladion is perplexed by the request, and Lillie shows him the sketch of Zoroark and Magearna together, explaining that Zoroark must have seen their father conducting his research. Gladion complies, calling Zoroark out. When Zoroark emerges from its [[Dusk Ball]], it is immediately overcome with familiarity if its surroundings and Magearna. Zoroark creates an {{a|illusion}}, showing Gladion and Lillie a flashback of Mohn working on Magearna with an infant Lillie watching on. The illusionary baby Lillie even manages to learn to walk, overwhelming the illusionary {{an|Lusamine}} with joy as she enters the room. As Mohn asks Magearna to look after his daughter, Lillie is drawn to tears by the historic vision. Suddenly, a stream of purple lights beam from Magearna\'s Soul-Heart, blinding everyone on the room and inadvertently ending the illusion. As the light dies down, they see that Magearna is moving once again. Magearna bows to Lillie and presents her with a flower bouquet. Lillie accepts the bouquet and proceeds to hug her now awakened friend. Gladion and Zoroark smile from the touching scene.\n\nMeanwhile, Ash stares at the full moon through his bedroom window, recalling Olivia\'s earlier advice on knowing the outside world. Filled with inspiration, he abruptly leaps from his bedsheets, disturbing Pikachu and Rotom\'s sleep. Ash declares that he and Pikachu will return to [[Pallet Town]] again before beginning their next quest, to [[New series|travel the world]], to which Pikachu happily complies.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
