It first aired in Japan on September 14, 2006 and in the United States on March 3, 2007.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/09_47-home-is-where-the-start-is/-->\n<i>The smoke finally clears at the Terracotta Town Pokémon Contest, and the winner is revealed—it is a tie between May and Ash! Both are declared the winner with only one prize medal between the two, so Sceptile cuts it neatly in half. That night, during dinner, May announces her intention to go to Johto and compete in Pokémon Contests. She doesn\'t want Max to come, though, because she\'d depend on her brother too much. Max is sad, but Ash cheers him up by promising to battle some day.\n\nMax and May board a ship headed to Hoenn and wave goodbye until the ship is out of view. Ash and Brock also separate, with Ash rushing home to eat. Team Rocket watches the two boys, but they are too demoralized to do anything. They psych themselves up just in time to catch an Electivire in a net. Ash runs over to help the Electric-type Pokémon, but Gary shows up and orders it to escape with Iron Tail. Gary sends the thieves blasting off, and though Ash wants to battle, Gary would just rather go back to Professor Oak\'s lab. Ash then heads home.\n\nBack at the Ketchum household no one is there to greet Ash, so he goes to Oak\'s lab instead. It seems quiet there, until everyone jumps out to surprise him. Ash gives his Battle Frontier symbols to his mom Delia to keep, and challenges Gary to a battle. Outside, Electivire and Pikachu face off with similar move sets, until Electivire manages to knock out Pikachu with a Protect and Thunder Punch combo. Gary then leaves, returning to Sinnoh. Ash decides he wants to go to Sinnoh as well. That night, Delia makes Ash some new clothes, and the next morning he leaves with just Pikachu at his side. However, Ash\'s Aipom sneaks on board the boat to Sinnoh and meets up with him. Unknown to any of them, Team Rocket has stowed away as well.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAs the smoke clears, both {{Ash}} and {{an|May}} are left with the same amount of points, and the match is a tie. They are both happy about this and the crowd gives them a huge cheer, as Ash and May meet in the center of the field and shake hands. [[Nurse Joy]] presents the {{DL|Ribbon|Terracotta Medal}} to Ash and May; however, she explains that there is only one Ribbon, so she doesn\'t know who to give it to, but Ash and May have an idea: May grabs the Ribbon, throws it in the air and Ash orders Sceptile to use {{m|Leaf Blade}} slicing the Ribbon in half so that both of them can share it.\n\nLater that evening, Ash, May, [[Max]], {{an|Brock}}, and all of their Pokémon are sitting around a bench having some hard earned dinner. Brock places his freshly cooked stew on the bench; May however seems somewhat distant. She announces that she is leaving to go to [[Johto]] alone to compete in the Pokémon Contests there, meaning Max will also have to leave and return to his parents in [[Petalburg City]]. She explains that she has had a great time traveling through [[Hoenn]] and [[Kanto]] with Brock and Ash but she has been thinking about going off to Johto for a while now and the fact that they are finished in Kanto is perfect for her and Max to leave.\n\nMax is very upset, getting up and walking off, ignoring May\'s calls. Ash gets up and pursues Max and Pikachu follows too. Max sits on a swing over the other side of the park, Ash follows close behind and starts to offer comforting words to Max. He knows Max is upset that he will be missing his friends and Max explains that when he was watching Ash and May battle in the Contest he wanted so much to be doing it too; all he wants to do is grow up quick so he can be a Trainer too and get to do all the things they do. Ash says once Max becomes a {{pkmn|Trainer}} he promises to challenge him to a battle which brightens Max up and he jumps to his feet to acknowledge Ash. Suddenly from the distance a large horn goes off, the boat which Max and May are supposed to be leaving on is due to depart in five minutes! Our heroes run off down the lane to the harbor and luckily make it in time. Max, May, and her Pokémon all wave goodbye to Ash, Brock and their Pokémon as they sail off into the sunset.\n\nThe next morning Ash and Brock come to their crossroads, they look at the sign together, [[Pewter City]] off in one direction, leading to [[Pewter Gym|Brock\'s home]] at the [[Gym]], and [[Pallet Town]] off in the opposite direction where {{Delia|Ash\'s family}} and {{an|Professor Oak}} reside. Except there\'s one last thing on Ash\'s mind, his stomach. Ash is hungry already, but as soon as he gets over this he runs off home, while Brock goes his own way. Overhead {{TRT}}\'s {{DL|Team Rocket\'s mechas|Meowth Balloon}} is floating by, [[James]] and {{MTR}} have a very unhappy look on their face, they are starting to doubt themselves but [[Jessie]] puts them back on the right track by offering a few words of wisdom. Suddenly out of nowhere sparks of electricity fly into the sky, Team Rocket get out their goggles and spot the Pokémon. At first they think it is Pikachu but on a closer inspection recognize it as an {{p|Electivire}}. Electivire uses {{m|Thunder Shock}} to knock an apple down from the tree and begins to eat it. Team Rocket poke up from behind a bush and Meowth fires a net from the launcher and grabs Electivire. It struggles under the net as Team Rocket start to pull it in. It fires out wild {{t|Electric}} attacks which Ash sees from the other side of the trees and runs to try help.\n\nTeam Rocket finish pulling in Electivire but then a voice comes from atop the ridge and tells them to let go of the Pokémon they have got in the net and the person jumps down from atop the ridge and reveals himself. Much to Team Rocket\'s shock, the owner of the voice happens to be {{Gary}}! Gary orders {{TP|Gary|Electivire}} to use Iron Tail, which it does and breaks free from the net. Team Rocket are furious and jump to try and grab Electivire but Gary orders a {{m|Thunder Punch}} which scores a direct hit and knocks Team Rocket away. Once Team Rocket are gone Ash tries to use his [[Pokédex]] to get some information on Electivire but there is no data available.\n\nGary explains that Electivire is a newly discovered Pokémon from [[Sinnoh]], which Ash gets excited about. Ash then challenges him to a battle, but Gary says no and just walks off.\n\nLater on, Ash arrives home and calls for his mother at his house, but neither she nor [[Mimey]] are around. He runs over to [[Professor Oak\'s Laboratory]] but he cannot find {{Tracey}} or Oak anywhere. He thinks this is really strange and starts to wander around the rooms. When he gets to the sitting room, all of a sudden Tracey and Mimey jump up from behind a sofa and set off some party poppers welcoming Ash home, while Oak, Gary and Delia come from the door on the other side of the room. Ash presents his mother with the plaque with all the {{gdis|Battle Frontier|III}} Symbols on and then after the pleasantries re-challenges Gary to the battle and he accepts.\n\nOutside the lab Ash and Gary are lined up ready to battle, Tracey is refereeing while Delia and Oak watch from the sidelines. Gary sends out Electivire and Ash sends out Pikachu, Pikachu starts with a Thunderbolt while Electivire counters with another Thunderbolt. Pikachu tries a {{m|Quick Attack}} but Electivire uses its tail to jump into the air out of the way and uses Iron Tail, which Pikachu counters with its own Iron Tail attack. Pikachu uses Thunderbolt again but Electivire jumps out of the way yet again. Ash calls Pikachu to use {{m|Volt Tackle}} on Electivire but Electivire uses {{m|Protect}} and then finishes Pikachu off with a powerful Thunder Punch. Gary and Electivire are the winners.\n\nGary walks over to Ash and starts to talk to him, saying that he may have won the {{Gdis|Battle Frontier|III}} but he should not take it for granted. Gary then announces that he is going to go to Sinnoh to {{pkmn|training|train}} his Pokémon and learn more about Pokémon. Tracey and Oak support this decision and back Gary, offering him some words of advice. Gary then looks over to Ash, turns his back on him and wanders off into the distance. Ash sits there and starts to talk to himself about Sinnoh and the newly discovered Pokémon. Delia watches on and senses the change in his heart. Ash stands up and announces his move to go to Sinnoh. As night time comes Delia is upstairs with a sparkle in her eye. She is sewing together fabric while talking of Ash.\n\nMorning comes and outside Ash has lined up all {{cat|Ash\'s Pokémon|the Pokémon he has traveled with in Hoenn and the Battle Frontier}}: {{AP|Sceptile}}, {{AP|Donphan}}, {{AP|Corphish}}, {{AP|Swellow}} and {{AP|Aipom}}. He says goodbye to Professor Oak, Tracey and to all his Pokémon, but before he goes Professor Oak hands over to him a newly updated Pokédex with all the Sinnoh information on it. Ash turns around and runs off down the lane, but we focus in on Aipom who looks very sad compared to the rest of Ash\'s Pokémon.\n\nA boat sails down across the screen, on board Ash and Pikachu are looking out to the sea and towards Sinnoh. The wind is blowing strongly, knocking [[Ash\'s hat]] off and heading to a staircase but suddenly stops. Aipom is there! She grabbed Ash\'s hat and gives it back to Ash, who welcomes Aipom to the Sinnoh team. On the side of the boat Team Rocket are hanging on for their lives, determined to follow Ash and Pikachu anywhere so that they can steal him and give him to the boss. Then they get washed up by a wave as the boat sails off into the distance to Sinnoh where Ash\'s newest adventures await.\n\n\'\'\'Next Time - A New Beginning!\'\'\'\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:Ash May Terracotta Ribbon.png|thumb|220px|Ash and May holding the Terracotta Medal]]\n* {{Ash}} and {{an|May}} tie in the final round of the unofficial {{to|Terracotta}} {{pkmn|Contest}} and decide to split the {{DL|Ribbon|Terracotta Medal}}<!--not Ribbon--> in half.\n* May announces her decision to go to the [[Johto]] [[region]] alone.\n* May and [[Max]] return to [[Petalburg City]], while {{an|Brock}} returns to [[Pewter City]].\n* Ash encounters {{Gary}}, who is revealed to have obtained an {{TP|Gary|Electivire}}.\n* Ash returns to [[Pallet Town]] and challenges Gary to a battle, but loses.\n* Gary returns to [[Sinnoh]] to continue his research.\n* Ash receives a new [[Pokédex]] from {{an|Professor Oak}}.\n* Ash decides to go to Sinnoh, leaving behind {{cat|Ash\'s Pokémon|all his Pokémon}} except {{AP|Pikachu}}.\n* [[Ash\'s Aipom]] stows away on the ship Ash and Pikachu are riding, following them to Sinnoh.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Electivire}} ({{OP|Gary|Electivire}})\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Tracey Sketchit]]\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{an|Professor Oak}}\n* [[Delia Ketchum]]\n* [[Gary Oak]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* Announcer\n* Audience\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Donphan}} ({{OP|Ash|Donphan}})\n* {{p|Swellow}} ({{OP|Ash|Swellow}})\n* {{p|Sceptile}} ({{OP|Ash|Sceptile}})\n* {{p|Corphish}} ({{OP|Ash|Corphish}})\n* {{p|Aipom}} ({{OP|Ash|Aipom}})\n* {{p|Blaziken}} ({{OP|May|Blaziken}})\n* {{p|Munchlax}} ({{OP|May|Munchlax}})\n* {{p|Squirtle}} ({{OP|May|Squirtle}})\n* {{p|Eevee}} ({{OP|May|Eevee}})\n* {{p|Forretress}} ({{OP|Brock|Forretress}})\n* {{p|Marshtomp}} ({{OP|Brock|Marshtomp}})\n* {{p|Bonsly}} ({{OP|Brock|Bonsly}})\n* {{p|Mr. Mime}} ({{Delia}}\'s; [[Mimey]])\n* {{p|Electivire}} ({{OP|Gary|Electivire}}; debut)\n\n==Trivia==\n* This is the season finale of [[S09|Pokémon: Battle Frontier]].\n* There is no {{pkmn|Trivia Quiz}} for this episode.\n<!--* From this episode onwards in the English dub, the title regularly shows an exclamatory mark at the end, if a question mark is not used instead.--><!--Is it really THIS episode?
