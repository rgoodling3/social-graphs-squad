It first aired in Japan on October 21, 1999 and in the United States on October 21, 2000. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/03_13-the-double-trouble-header/-->\n<i>In a Pokémon battle, Ash soundly defeats an ambitious young Trainer, who runs away dejectedly. Before Ash can comfort the novice, though, Team Rocket steps in, convincing the girl that Ash won by foul play, and recruiting her to their cause.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nVenturing from [[New Bark Town]], {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} stumble across a girl and her {{TP|Casey|Chikorita}} in the midst of training. As a {{pkmn2|wild}} {{p|Rattata}} hops out of a bush, Chikorita is sent into {{pkmn|battle}}. Chikorita\'s first {{m|Tackle}} misses its target, but the next attack knocks Rattata out. The young {{pkmn|Trainer}} sees her opportunity and immediately {{pkmn2|caught|catches}} it with a {{i|Poké Ball}}. She celebrates her latest catch with a rendition of the Team Electabuzz [[Baseball]] theme. Afterward, she calls back her Chikorita and spots {{AP|Pikachu}}. She pulls him off of Ash\'s shoulder and asks him to shock her since she has been wanting to know what it feels like. Despite Ash\'s protests against it, both of them get shocked by Pikachu.\n\nThe group takes the time to meet the Trainer, who introduces herself as {{an|Casey}}. She reveals that she has an affinity for yellow-striped {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} and wants to catch an {{p|Electabuzz}}. She also reveals that she is a huge Team Electabuzz fan, but Ash notes that the team tends to place last. To settle this, Casey challenges Ash to a three-on-three battle. Casey starts the battle with {{p|Pidgey}} and Ash sends out {{AP|Charizard}}. Both {{an|Misty}} and {{an|Brock}} are surprised by his choice, given that Casey is a new Trainer. However, Casey calls out the first attack and Pidgey flies in for a {{m|Quick Attack}}, but it merely bounces off Charizard\'s chest and is soon defeated by a strong exhale by Charizard.\n\nCasey recalls Pidgey and then sends out her new Rattata. Casey commands Rattata to use Tackle against Charizard, but the Pokémon just bounces off Charizard\'s stomach again. Becoming infuriated with how the battle is ending up, Casey sends out Chikorita and tells it to use {{m|Vine Whip}} on Charizard. Ash simply has Charizard use {{m|Flamethrower}} on Chikorita, causing the {{type|Grass}}\'s head leaf to catch fire, and it soon faints. Brock officially declares Ash the winner, leaving Casey distraught.\n\nThough Ash and his friends commend her resolve, Casey runs away, her pride broken. In the middle of fleeing, she trips and falls to the ground. With this, Casey recalls her family\'s tradition of cheering on the Electabuzz, because even though they haven\'t won any of their games, they never gave up. With that in mind, she gets back up and tells herself that she will be just like Team Electabuzz. With this proclamation, {{TRT}} applauds Casey and reveal themselves before her. Sporting Team Electabuzz baseball gear, they tell her that they also support Team Electabuzz, and Casey instantly opens up to them. After confiding their losses at Ash\'s hands to Casey, Team Rocket convinces her that he is a cheater for using a Charizard against her and that Charizard is forbidden from being used against new Trainers.\n\nFinding Ash once again, Casey challenges Ash to another battle. The stage is set in a baseball diamond and Casey starts the battle with Chikorita, while Ash uses Pikachu. Both Brock and Misty root for Casey as she begins the battle by telling Chikorita to use {{m|Sweet Scent}}. The attack immediately leaves Ash and Pikachu a little dazed by the smell. Chikorita then lands a Tackle attack on Pikachu. Team Rocket watches the battle unfold from the scoreboard, waiting to implement their cheating tactic to assist Casey. After a small discussion, {{MTR}} presses a button, which activates a group of robotic Electabuzz fans to cheer Casey on and boost her confidence.\n\nContinuing the battle, Ash commands Pikachu to use {{m|Thunderbolt}} against Chikorita. However, Chikorita easily deflects the attack by spinning the leaf upon her head. Brock tells Ash that Grass-type Pokémon are strong against {{type|Electric}}s, and therefore, he\'d have to change his battle strategy. Chikorita then lands another Tackle on Pikachu. After this, Team Rocket then turns on a giant batting machine. Ash questions what it is, while Casey accuses him of being a cheater and that the machine simply proves it. However, Team Rocket seizes control of the machine and sends it after Chikorita, who cowers in fear of not knowing what to do. Just then, Pikachu jumps out in front of Chikorita to protect it against the contraption. Casey gasps, surprised that he would do this since she had been convinced that Ash was a cheater.\n\nThe machine soon captures Pikachu and Chikorita, after which Team Rocket reveals themselves to everyone and recites their {{motto}}. Ash tells Casey who Team Rocket really is, and Casey realizes that she had been tricked all along as Team Rocket tells them of their plans for both Pikachu and Chikorita. Meowth presses a button on his remote, and several pitching machines emerge and begin sending a flurry of baseballs towards Casey and Ash. As soon as a baseball hits Casey in the leg, she immediately gives up, but Ash declares that they can\'t just allow Team Rocket to defeat them. After he compares a Pokémon match to baseball, Ash is hit by a baseball but claims that it is not a Poké Ball.\n\nTouched by what Ash had said, Casey gets back up on her feet, pulls out her baseball bat, and determinedly hits all of the baseballs back, leaving Team Rocket red-faced. Afterwards, Ash calls out {{AP|Squirtle}} and {{AP|Bulbasaur}}, while Casey calls out her Pidgey and Rattata to help hit away the rest of the baseballs. With Team Rocket now facing an onslaught of baseballs, Casey attacks [[James]] with Rattata and Pidgey, getting Chikorita and Pikachu back.\n\nCasey then has Chikorita to use {{m|Razor Leaf}} on Team Rocket, and Pikachu shocks them with Thunderbolt. Next, Ash and Casey team up to have Chikorita and Pikachu to perform a double Tackle attack, which sends Team Rocket blasting off. With the battle won, Pikachu and Chikorita congratulate each other while Casey and Ash share a high-five. Casey apologizes to Ash for letting Team Rocket convince her that he was a cheater. She leaves Ash and his friends on her own journey, hoping to encounter them at the [[Johto League]].\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

However, the shot of Meowth getting hit by a baseball in the face was not changed.\n* The exchange between Ash and {{ashfr}} was different between the two versions. Originally, Ash mentions that he wants to hurry up and capture a new Pokémon. {{an|Misty}} states that she thought Totodile was cute and how she wanted one, and {{an|Brock}} then mentions he wants a {{p|Cyndaquil}}.\n* The robotic cheerleaders\' cheers were originally "Ato hitori!" ("One person left!", as in, one more out until the end of a baseball game). This was changed to "[[Gotta catch \'em all!]]" in the dub.\n* Ash\'s advice to Casey was originally supposed to be that she should keep her eyes on the ball, and that Pokémon matches are similar in the sense that the Trainer has to keep their eye on the opponent. This was rewritten in the dub.\n* Ash\'s statement about a Pokémon not being a bean ball was originally an untranslatable pun relating to the words タマ \'\'tama\'\' and ボール \'\'ball\'\', which are both used in Japanese in different contexts to refer to a ball.\n* In the dub, Brock wonders if Casey has an older sister he could date, while in the original version, Brock expresses interest in Casey herself, stating that she would be a lot of fun {{wp|age of consent|in eight years}}.\n* In the original version, Ash declares that Casey will be his new [[rival]].\n\n<gallery>\nEP118 Deleted Scene.png|A frame from the deleted image\n</gallery>\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|bg={{tt|Палавата твърдоглавка|The harsh hardcore}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|投手的菊草葉|The Pitcher\'s Chikorita}}\n|cs={{tt|Dvojnásobný zápas|Double match}}\n|nl={{tt|Een Lastige Tweestrijd|A Difficult Dilemma}}\n|de={{tt|Im Team gegen Team Rocket|As Team against Team Rocket}}\n|fi={{tt|Takalaiton, Ash!|Back foul, Ash!}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Leçon de base-ball|Baseball lessons}}\n|he=משחק ללא חוקים{{tt|mischak lelo chukim|A game with no rules}}\n|hu={{tt|Vállvetve|Shoulder to shoulder}}\n|it={{tt|Una giovane Allenatrice|A young Trainer}}{{tt|*|Original 2000 dub}} <br> {{tt|Il doppio scontro|The double clash}}{{tt|*|2014 K2 TV dub}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Um Desempate com Encrenca em Dobro|A Tie-Break with Double Trouble}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Duplos Sarilhos|Trouble Doubled}}\n|es_la={{tt|La Principiante|The Beginner}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Dos encuentros problemáticos|Two troublesome encounters}}\n|sv={{tt|Baseball eller Pokéboll?|Baseball or Poké Ball?}}\n|pl={{tt|Co dwie głowy to nie jedna|Two heads are better than one}}{{tt|*|Polish proverb}}\n|ro={{tt|Pericol Dublu|Double Danger}}\n|hi=नयी ट्रेनर Casey का जुनून {{tt|\'\'Nayi Trainer Casey ka Junoon\'\'|The Passion of a new trainer, Casey}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}} \n}}\n\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP117 |\nprevtitle=Don\'t Touch That \'dile |\nnextcode=EP119 |\nnexttitle=A Sappy Ending |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Johto}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0118}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|118]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Hideki Sonoda]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Hisashi Shiina]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Kiyoshi Fukumoto]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Katsumi Hashimoto]]\n\n[[de:Im Team gegen Team Rocket!]]\n[[es:EP120]]\n[[fr:EP118]]\n[[it:EP118]]\n[[ja:無印編第118話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第119集]]'}
