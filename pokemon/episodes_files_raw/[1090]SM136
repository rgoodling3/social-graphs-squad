Gladion has Silvally fire an {{m|Air Slash}}, though Turtonator counters with {{m|Flamethrower}}. Silvally follows up with {{m|Crush Claw}}, to which Turtonator uses {{m|Dragon Tail}} to defend itself. Gladion orders another Crush Claw and Turtonator uses {{m|Shell Smash}} to make a speedy evasion. Consequently, Silvally\'s claws get stuck in the battlefield, so Kiawe prepares to land a devastating {{m|Inferno Overdrive}} [[Z-Move]] on his opponent. Before Silvally takes the hit, Gladion tosses a [[Fire Memory]] to it, and it emerges unscathed. The crowd and Kiawe are taken aback by the clever strategy, while Turtonator is beginning to stumble from exhaustion.Gladion orders another Crush Claw. Turtonator attempts to reflect the attack with Dragon Tail, but gets hit anyway. Turtonator wobbles a bit, before collapsing onto the field. [[Olivia]] rushes over, and she declares Gladion as the winner of the round. Kiawe is clearly shocked by the loss, but thanks Turtonator for its efforts nonetheless. In the sidelines, {{Ash}} admits both Trainers were cool, to which {{an|Lillie}} and [[Mimo]] smile in agreement. Gladion approaches Kiawe to thank him for the great match, and the pair shake hands. Kiawe smiles, and admits as of now, Gladion is now his rival. He promises not to lose next time, while Gladion states he looks forward to next time. [[Olivia]] tears at the good sportsmanship, however [[Guzma]] is annoyed and walks off. [[Plumeria]] follows behind, though she is concerned as she recalls seeing his trashed collection of second place trophies and reflects that things may have been different if he won something.\n\n{{TRT}}\'s Manalo doughnuts are selling well, getting the trio ever closer to building an amazing mecha with the sales money. Meanwhile at [[Bewear\'s den|the den]], {{an|Bewear}} and {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Stufful}} continue to enjoy their hot spring and {{p|Oranguru}} robot food service.\n\nAsh\'s match against Guzma is fast approaching. As {{ashfr}} offer him support, [[Tupp]] and his gang confront Ash, declaring that Guzma won\'t lose to the likes of him, for he had never lost. Ash claims they can\'t know the outcome of the battle yet, but the {{tc|Team Skull Grunt}}s continue to belittle him, sparking an argument between the rival sides. Plumeria orders them to stop the discussion, as she and Guzma arrive. Tupp points to Ash and his friends, how they announced that Guzma will lose. Guzma merely scowls at Ash, before leaving in a huff as he momentarily sees something that reminds him of {{an|Professor Kukui}} in Ash. Tupp leads the other two into a cheer for Guzma, though Plumeria scolds them for distracting the boss.\n\nWith the fate of a future [[Alola League]] at risk because of Guzma, Kukui asks [[Nanu]] to get ready and to judge fairly. Nanu hopes this battle won\'t be too much trouble as he takes his position as the referee. Ash and Guzma step onto the battlefield, with Nanu proclaiming the same rules as in the last battle. Guzma sends in his {{p|Scizor}}, while Ash calls out {{AP|Torracat}} and starts off with a {{m|Fire Blast}}. Scizor, however, responds with {{m|U-turn}}, which hits Torracat and triggers an early substitution. As Torracat executes Fire Blast, Scizor returns to its {{i|Poké Ball}}, and {{p|Golisopod}} is sent out, who immediately shields itself from the attack. Golisopod uses {{m|Liquidation}}, which hits its mark. Golisopod repeats its attack, which Torracat evades and retaliates with {{m|Fire Fang}} on Golisopod. As a result Golsiopod loses its Liquidation attack, but rushes in for a {{m|Throat Chop}}, which knocks Torracat away. Torracat uses Fire Blast, which Golisopod slashes through with Liquidation. Torracat barely dodges the follow up Liquidation before attempting a {{m|Flame Charge}}. Golisopod fires off a {{m|Pin Missile}}, though Torracat breezes through the projectiles and lands its attack. With Golisopod down, Torracat uses Fire Fang. Golisopod tries to regain control with a Throat Chop, but Torracat holds onto Golisopod and strikes it with {{m|Revenge}}.\n\nTorracat rushes in for another Flame Charge, to which Golisopod responds Pin Missile, which hits Torracat, stopping his attack. Torracat takes a moment to catch its breath, though Guzma is set on finishing the match as soon as possible. Golisopod goes to use another Liquidation, which collides with Torracat\'s Revenge, causing the two sides to slide backwards. As Torracat unleashes a Fire Blast, Golisopod decides to make an {{a|Emergency Exit}} and returns to its Poké Ball. Scizor emerges and is blindsided as it takes the full Fire Blast attack. Guzma is crushed to see Scizor fall, even more so when he hears Nanu proclaiming Scizor having fainted. Guzma starts shuddering from the defeat, as he calls Scizor back and sends Golisopod out. Guzma starts scolding Golisopod for sabotaging his efforts. While Ash keeps Torracat on the field, Guzma dares Golisopod not to lose, as his battle against Ash [[SM137|continues]].\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
