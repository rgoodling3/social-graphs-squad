It was first broadcast in Japan on May 13, 1999 and in the United States on March 25, 2000.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/02_41-meowth-rules/-->\n<i>Team Rocket has engine trouble and lands on an island where the locals are waiting for the Great Meowth of Bounty to arrive and fulfill an ancient prophesy. When Meowth gets mistaken for this great creature with special powers, he enjoys the special treatment and decides to play along. But, when he\'s unable to perform the ancient ritual that\'s expected of him, the treatment he gets isn\'t quite so fun anymore.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Jessie]] and [[James]] begin repairs on {{TRT}}\'s {{p|Magikarp}} [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|submarine]], which has washed up on some rocks. James asks {{MTR}} to use {{m|Pay Day}} so they can have money, but Meowth reveals he cannot learn it because his ability to talk negates his ability to learn it. He turns the argument around when he thinks James is hiding coins, and Jessie searches him, finding his favorite gold bottle cap. When Team Rocket spots {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} in the distance, looking for an island to rest at, they decide to confront them. Before they can do anything, however, the submarine begins to sink. Ash sends {{AP|Squirtle}} to attack them with {{m|Water Gun}}, sending the trio blasting off.\n\nOn [[Golden Island]], people gather around a gold {{p|Meowth}} statue, wishing for the Great Meowth of Bounty to arrive as predicted, on the night of the full moon. Meanwhile, Meowth crashes on its beach, and the villagers find him and take him inland, putting him in front of the statue. Meowth\'s talking shocks the villagers, but they still accept him as the Meowth of Bounty and hails him as such. He decides to take advantage of it, snacking on all of the fruit they provided him.\n\nBy the next day, Meowth begins to enjoy the humble treatment, ordering the villagers to bring him meatballs and entertainment. As Meowth watches over the coast and plays a guitar, he wishes that Jessie and James were with him. Just then, he notices Ash and his friends approaching and knows that they will blow his cover. Knowing this threatens his happiness, he orders the villagers to force them off the island, propagating them as hostile. The villagers use the Meowth statue to confront Ash, attacking with its giant paw. They dodge it and {{AP|Pikachu}} uses {{m|Thunderbolt}}, but it does nothing. The machine chases them off the island and forces them to jump back into the sea. The Meowth statue then returns to the ark with Jessie and James in tow. Meowth decides to lie, saying he doesn\'t know them, out of fear that they will ruin his happiness as well. The villagers subsequently order them to be thrown back into the sea.\n\nTeam Rocket manages to sneak back onto the island, however, and watches as Meowth enjoys himself. The villagers decide to begin the ceremony in which Meowth will use Pay Day to bring them happiness and prosperity, as the prophecy foretells. Knowing that his inability to use the move will blow his cover, Meowth tries to leave, but the statue grabs him and shakes him for coins. It fails as Meowth admits that he cannot use Pay Day. Everyone is shocked, and the elder believes that Meowth needs battle experience to recall how to use Pay Day. Even though Meowth argues that it won\'t work, the villagers are adamant and take him to the stadium.\n\nAt the stadium, a huge crowd watches as they send out a {{p|Nidoking}} to fight Meowth. Meowth runs around and avoids Nidoking, eventually exhausting him. The villagers check for coins, but Meowth still hasn\'t produced any. They continue the training by sending out an {{p|Onix}}, which knocks Meowth around and locks it in a Bind attack. Jessie and James, disguised as villagers, witness this and decide to help Meowth. They throw coins and even James\'s bottle caps onto the battlefield, convincing the villagers that Meowth\'s Pay Day is being activated.\n\nThe villagers thank Meowth for the coins, believing that the prophecy has come true. As they ask him to stay and rule them, Meowth notices a gold bottle cap atop the stack and realizes what Jessie and James did for him. Meowth tears up and runs to the beach, finding Jessie and James and admitting how close they are. When they are confronted by the villagers want him to stay, Meowth confesses the sham to them, and Jessie and James forgive Meowth. They all jump aboard the Magikarp submarine and leave, against the villagers\' will. Meanwhile, Ash and his friends continue along, unaware of what really happened on the island. Jessie and James decide to make another attempt at giving Meowth battle experience to learn Pay Day, which shocks Meowth.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode. Only events pertaining to the series as a whole, such as catching and releasing Pokémon and obtaining Badges, go here. -->\n* {{MTR}} reveals that he\'s unable to learn {{m|Pay Day}} due to having spent too much energy on learning how to {{pkmn2|talking|talk}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n[[File:Dare da EP096.png|200px|thumb|{{tt|Dare da?|Who\'s That Pokémon?}}]]\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* {{Tracey}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Mikeosu]] (young man)\n* [[Shimajio]] (old man)\n* Dancers\n* Villagers\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP EP096.png|200px|thumb|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Magnemite}} \'\'(US and international)\'\', {{p|Meowth}} \'\'(Japan)\'\'\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Togepi}} ({{OP|Misty|Togepi}})\n* {{p|Squirtle}} ({{OP|Ash|Squirtle}})\n* {{p|Lapras}} ({{OP|Ash|Lapras}})\n* {{p|Nidoking}} (villagers\')\n* {{p|Onix}} (villagers\')\n{{-}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[Professor Oak\'s Pokémon Lecture]]: {{p|Clefairy}}: {{an|Professor Oak|Oak}} discusses how Clefairy has many riddles, and that its {{m|Metronome}} attack is quite strong. Oak tells Clefairy to use Metronome, causing a spoon to fall and hit Oak on his head. Then, a bunch of spoons fall and cover Oak.\n** Pokémon senryū summary: A fluffy walk with Clefairy, how fun.\n* This is one of the very few episodes outside [[Pokémon Chronicles]] where neither {{Ash}} or {{ashfr}} play major roles. It is also the second episode where {{MTR}} is the main character, the first one being \'\'[[EP070|Go West Young Meowth]]\'\'.\n* This was chosen by {{wp|Louis Kurihara}} as the tenth episode of \'\'[[Pocket Monsters Anime Premier 10]]\'\'.\n* In the opening scene, Meowth is seen holding clams, a [[Animals in the Pokémon world|real-life animal]].\n* In this episode, {{TRT}} uses a {{DL|Team Rocket mottos|Meowth Rules! motto|variation}} of their motto. There was also a different background music in the second motto, while the first one had the normal music.\n* This episode is featured on \'\'Volume 11: Meowth\'\' from [[Viz Media]]\'s {{OBP|Pokémon All-Stars|Region 1}} series.\n* When Meowth is greeted and presented with the large offering of food, Meowth responds, "I\'m a little short on cash, but I can pay you for the food on Tuesday." This is a reference to {{wp|J. Wellington Wimpy|Wimpy}} from the \'\'{{wp|Popeye}}\'\' cartoons, who is famous for ordering hamburgers and paying for them on Tuesday.\n* When Meowth finishes off his 100 meatballs, he exclaims, "Whisker-licking good!" This is a reference to {{wp|KFC}} and {{wp|Colonel Sanders}}\'s famous line "It\'s finger-licking good!" \n\n===Errors===\n* In the final scene in which {{AP|Lapras}} appears, the area below its mouth is colored blue.\n* Throughout the episode, [[Mikeosu]], {{an|Misty}}, and [[James]] refer to Meowth as a "cat type".\n\n<gallery>\nEP096 Error.png|Lapras\'s miscolored mouth\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[Pikachu\'s Jukebox]]: [[What Kind of Pokémon Are You?]]\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FFDDAA|bordercolor=FFBB55\n|zh_cmn={{tt|喵喵之島|Meowth\'s Island}}\n|cs={{tt|Meowth vládcem|Meowth the Ruler}}\n|da={{tt|Meowth styrer|Meowth rules}}\n|nl={{tt|De Heilige Meowth!|The Holy Meowth!}}\n|de={{tt|Mauzis Abenteuer|Meowth\'s adventure}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Le jour de paye|Payday}}\n|he=מיאו שולט {{tt|\'\'Meowth sholet\'\'|Meowth rules}}\n|hi=दानवीर Meowth {{tt|\'\'Daanveer Meowth\'\'|Generous Meowth}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n|hu={{tt|A nagy Meowth|Meowth the Great}}\n|it={{tt|Una prova di amicizia|A friendship test}}\n|ko=행복의 나옹님\n|no={{tt|Meowth hersker!|Meowth rules!}}\n|pl={{tt|Wybieraj, Meowth|Choose, Meowth}}\n|pt_br={{tt|O Rei Meowth|The King Meowth}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Meowth Governa|Meowth Rules}}\n|ro={{tt|Meowth Conduce|Meowth Rules!}}\n|ru={{tt|Правление Мяута|Reign of Meowth }}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Meowth es el jefe!|Meowth is the boss!}} {{tt|*|Recited by Meowth as \'\'Meowth, o sea yo, ¡soy el jefe!\'\' which means \'\'Meowth, that means I, am the boss!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Meowth al poder|Meowth to the power}}\n|sv={{tt|Gåvan|The gift}}\n}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP095 |\nprevtitle=A Shipful of Shivers |\nnextcode=EP097 |\nnexttitle=Tracey Gets Bugged |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Orange}} \n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0096}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|096]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Junki Takegami]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded and directed by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Masaaki Iwane]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Meowth]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Team Rocket]]\n\n[[de:Mauzis Abenteuer]]\n[[es:EP098]]\n[[fr:EP096]]\n[[it:EP096]]\n[[ja:無印編第96話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第97集]]'}
