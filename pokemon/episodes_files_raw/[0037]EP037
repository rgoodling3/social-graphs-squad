It was first broadcast in Japan on December 9, 1997 and in the United States on October 26, 1998.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/01_35-dittos-mysterious-mansion/-->\n<i>Being caught in a sudden rain shower, our heroes are obliged to seek shelter. In the middle of a clearing, they find a small, ghastly cabin. Dragging the reluctant Misty, Ash and Brock enter the cabin, instantly getting the impression that they are not alone. Could this be a haunted cabin? They soon discover that it is the Copycat house in which the trainer of Ditto lives. Intrigued by Ditto, Ash proposes a battle between Ditto and Pikachu.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nWhen it begins to rain, {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} stumble across an old house in the middle of nowhere. Believing it to be deserted, they go inside. To their surprise, {{AP|Pikachu}} plays with what seems to be another Pikachu. However, this Pikachu\'s face is weird, which leads to {{an|Brock}} thinking it is a new kind of Pikachu. Ash tries to {{pkmn2|caught|catch}} it, but a girl dressed as Ash appears and stops him. The girl introduces herself as [[Duplica]] and reveals that the Pikachu is actually her {{TP|Duplica|Ditto}}. The mansion is called the "The [[House of Imite]]" and serves as a rest stop and performance space for her imitation shows. Upon reading {{p|Ditto}}\'s entry in the [[Pokédex]] and hearing that it cannot learn any other [[Move|attacks]] besides {{m|Transform}}, Ash is unconvinced of its usefulness in a {{pkmn|battle}}, so Duplica challenges him to one. Ash chooses {{AP|Bulbasaur}} and tries to attack using {{m|Razor Leaf}}, but Duplica\'s Ditto Transforms and wins using a {{m|Vine Whip}} attack. Later, Duplica explains that she wants to be a Ditto Master and a star. However, she cannot achieve this goal because her Ditto is unable to mirror other {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}\' faces and always retains the face of a Ditto, much to the disappointment of her audiences.\n\nThen, {{TRT}} appears and tries to steal Ditto, in the hopes that they can get it to transform into {{p|Dratini}} and present it to {{an|Giovanni|their boss}} as a [[Legendary Pokémon]]. Using {{TP|James|Weezing}}\'s {{m|Smokescreen}}, they are able to escape with Ditto. Once they are away from the house, [[Jessie]] and [[James]] try to test Ditto\'s power by having it turn into a {{p|Dratini}} from a picture in a book that they have. However, Jessie suddenly says that they should have a little bit of fun before handing Ditto over to the boss. She asks Ditto to transform into what a certain boy would look like if he were an adult, and pulls out a photo frame. James and {{MTR}} then try to get Jessie to show the picture to them, but she refuses. Ditto agrees, and transforms into a picture of a man with blue hair, though it has Ditto\'s face. When it licks Jessie\'s face, James and Meowth laugh hysterically, but Jessie responds by furiously slapping them unconscious. She then commands Ditto to become a Dratini, but instead, it transforms into a book, which aggravates Jessie even further.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the mansion, Ash talks about how a {{pkmn|Trainer}} decides how a Ditto would transform. {{AP|Pidgeotto}} and {{TP|Brock|Zubat}}, who were on guard, return with news that they saw Ditto. Ash and his friends then decide to go and save Ditto. Elsewhere, Team Rocket, frustrated at Ditto\'s inability to fully transform into whatever they wish, threaten it into transforming correctly, pleasing them. Just then, Ash, {{an|Brock}}, {{an|Misty}}, and Duplica, all dressed in {{TRT}} uniforms, arrive and perform their own variation of Team Rocket\'s {{motto}}, much to the anger of the real trio. The group then demands Ditto back, but are surprised to see two identical Meowth. However, Duplica is happy that Team Rocket was able to get her Ditto to transform correctly. Team Rocket tries to trick them by giving them the real Meowth and escaping in their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|balloon]] with Ditto. However, this fails when Duplica says she can tell that Meowth isn\'t her Ditto, even though it looks identical to the other Meowth. She throws Meowth at the balloon, causing Team Rocket to drop Ditto. Duplica tells it to transform into a cannon and fire Pikachu at the balloon. After being hit by Pikachu\'s {{m|Thunder Shock}}, the balloon bursts and Team Rocket is blasted off again. Now that Ditto can transform perfectly, Duplica reopens her theater for performances. She thanks Ash and his friends, and they leave, with Ash hoping to catch his own Ditto someday.\n\nMeanwhile, Jessie and James attempt to carry out their original plan without Ditto and put Meowth into a Dratini suit to this end, though he is unimpressed and {{m|scratch}}es them.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

Ironically, both {{pkmn|battle}}s had to deal with a Pokémon that technically isn\'t an original or natural-born, as Mewtwo\'s Venusaur was created through cloning, whereas [[Duplica\'s Ditto]] transformed into Bulbasaur for the fight.\n* Duplica claims that Ditto is the only Pokémon that can use Transform, but {{p|Mew}} shares this ability. However, since Mew was at this point a secret Pokémon, the writers probably made Duplica not know about Mew\'s existence.\n* When Duplica imitates Ash, she is even wearing a hat just like his; this shows her knack for getting even rare outfits for her mimicry, as there were only 100 given away.\n* When Duplica imitates [[Officer Jenny]], she says "My name\'s Jenny. You\'re under arrest for Pokémon poaching." This is a shortened version of what the Officer Jenny stationed in the {{safari|Kanto}} said to the gang in \'\'[[EP034|The Kangaskhan Kid]]\'\' and is most likely the same audio, due to the exact same inflections.\n* As [[James]] furiously points out, when Ash and his friends imitate Team Rocket, Duplica incorrectly says "To \'\'\'ignite\'\'\' all peoples within our nation."\n* It is revealed that Ditto can also transform into inanimate objects like books, photo-frames, etc.\n* It is also revealed that Ditto cannot transform into a Pokémon from a picture, so there must be a real one around for it to imitate.\n** Also, since it gains all the abilities of the Pokémon it transforms into, if that Pokémon has learned to speak human language then Ditto can temporarily gain that ability for itself.\n* This episode was not shown in order by [[Pokémon in South Asia#Pokémon on Hungama TV|Hungama TV in India]] for unknown reasons. This episode was shown after [[EP051]], and [[EP036]] was directly followed by [[EP039]], as [[EP038]] is [[Banned episodes|banned]] globally.\n* In the first Japanese airing, the next episode preview was from [[EP038]], and in the subsequent airings, there is no preview. However, when Kids Station airs this episode, the preview is from [[EP039]].\n* Team Rocket\'s plan for Ditto to pose as a Dratini (and later to force Meowth himself to disguise himself as such) for their boss may be a reference to the events of [[EP035]].\n\n===Errors===\n* Ash\'s gloves disappear briefly at the beginning.\n* When Ash\'s Bulbasaur is caught in the vines, the grip gets looser between shots.\n* In the Swedish dub, James says "Drantini" instead of "Dratini" when imagining himself giving it to the boss.\n* When Ditto transforms into Voltorb, its mouth is on the bottom half on its body. However, it then appears on the upper half, before moving back to the bottom half.\n\n<gallery>\nEP037 error.png|Ash with no gloves\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[PokéRap]]: Day 2\n* Ditto keeps its Japanese voice when it\'s transformed into Pikachu in the English version.\n* The scene where Team Rocket gets irritated by the imitation motto is removed from the German version.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=AFA|bordercolor=FAA\n|zh_cmn={{tt|百變怪跟模仿少女 / 百变怪跟模仿少女|Ditto and the Mimic Girl}}\n|cs={{tt|Dittův tajemný dům|Ditto\'s mysterious house}}\n|da={{tt|Dittos Mystiske Hus|Ditto\'s Mysterious House}}\n|nl={{tt|Het Geheimzinnige Landhuis|The Mysterious Mansion}}\n|fi={{tt|Ditto ja salaisuuksien talo|Ditto and the house of secrets}}\n|fr_ca={{tt|Le manoir mystérieux|The mysterious mansion}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Le manoir mystérieux|The mysterious mansion}}\n|de={{tt|Die mysteriöse Villa|The mysterious mansion}}\n|he=בית החיקויים של דיטו {{tt|\'\'Beit ha\'khikuyim shel Ditto\'\'|Ditto\'s imitation house}}\n|hi=Ditto का नकल-विला {{tt|\'\'Ditto ka Nakal Villa\'\'|Ditto\'s House of Imitation}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n|hu={{tt|A csodálatos Ditto|The Wonderful Ditto}}\n|it={{tt|Un Pokémon dopo l\'altro|A Pokémon after the other}}{{tt|*|Original 2000 dub}} <br> {{tt|La misteriosa casa di Ditto|Ditto\'s mysterious house}}{{tt|*|2014 K2 TV dub}}\n|ko={{tt|변신의 천재 메타몽|The Transforming Ditto Genius}}\n|no={{tt|Dittos mystiske herregård|Ditto\'s mysterious mansion}}\n|pl={{tt|Tajemniczy dom Ditto|Ditto\'s mysterious house}}\n|pt_br={{tt|A Mansão Misteriosa do Ditto|Ditto\'s Mysterious Mansion}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|A Mansão Misteriosa do Ditto|Ditto\'s Mysterious Mansion}}\n|ro={{tt|Casa Misterioasă a lui Ditto|The Mysterious House of Ditto}}\n|ru={{tt|Таинственный дом Дитто|Ditto\'s Mysterious Mansion}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡La misteriosa mansión de Ditto!|Ditto\'s mysterious mansion!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|La misteriosa mansión de Ditto|Ditto\'s mysterious mansion}}\n|sv={{tt|Imitehuset|The imite house}}\n|uk={{tt|Таємничій Будинок Дітто|Ditto\'s Mysterious House}}\n}}\n{{-}}\n\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP036 |\nprevtitle=The Bridge Bike Gang |\nnextcode=EP038 |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Kanto| }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0037}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|037]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Atsuhiro Tomioka]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Yoshitaka Fujimoto]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Kiyotaka Itani]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Hiroshi Sakai]]\n\n[[de:Die mysteriöse Villa]]\n[[es:EP037]]\n[[fr:EP037]]\n[[it:EP037]]\n[[ja:無印編第37話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第37集]]'}
