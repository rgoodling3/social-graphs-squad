It was first broadcast in Japan on August 15, 2002 and in the United States on August 30, 2003. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/05_51-heres-lookin-at-you-elekid/-->\n<i>A troublesome Elekid begins harassing Larvitar only moments before Team Rocket swoops in and captures both rare Pokémon in a high-tensile steel net. As Ash and friends give chase, they bump into their old friend, Casey, who is looking for her Elekid, a Pokémon she had recently acquired to help her in cheering for her favorite baseball team, the Electabuzz. Ash and Casey manage to rescue their kidnapped Pokémon from Team Rocket\'s clutches, but in the process lose track of Elekid and Larvitar once again. As Jessie and James move on, they bump into the same Magikarp salesman that has troubled James on many previous occasions. That notwithstanding, James is talked into trading his Victreebel for one of this salesman\'s Weepinbell. All parties converge as Ash and Casey find their Pokémon at the same time as Team Rocket. In the heat of battle, James\'s Weepinbell evolves into a Victreebel. This isn\'t enough to turn the tide of battle, however, and Team Rocket is defeated. Upset by its hapless defeat, James abandons his second Victreebel of the day.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} have stopped for lunch. Suddenly a wild {{p|Elekid}} emerges from the shrubbery and promptly eats some of {{AP|Larvitar}}\'s food. It prepares to attack the group, though {{AP|Pikachu}} responds with his own {{t|Electric}} attack. Ash tries to stop the conflict from escalating, but gets shocked as a result. Elekid turns its attention to Larvitar and begins patting it on the back, though Larvitar doesn\'t seem to be enjoying the attention. Unexpectedly, {{TRT}} swoops in and nets both Elekid and Larvitar for themselves. Ash calls out {{AP|Bayleef}}, but her {{m|Razor Leaf}} attack fails to cut up the capture net. [[James]] orders his {{TP|James|Weezing}}, and its {{m|Smokescreen}} helps the Rocket trio escape in their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|Meowth balloon]]. However, Elekid manages to break both Larvitar and itself free from Team Rocket, and the two begin wandering around the forest together.\n\nAs they search for Larvitar, Ash and his friends run into {{an|Casey}} and see that her Bayleef has [[Evolution|evolved]] into a {{TP|Casey|Meganium}}. They learn that Casey is after the same Elekid that they saw earlier, so she joins them in their search. During their walk, Elekid overhears Larvitar\'s stomach grumbling. It promptly fetches some apples from a nearby tree and hands one to Larvitar. As Larvitar goes to nibble gently, Elekid shows it how to take a real bite. The small gesture instantly makes Larvitar feel at ease. Meanwhile, Team Rocket are standing from a tree branch and looking for any signs of their lost catches with a set of binoculars. James is feeling reluctant about all the effort for the little Pokemon, and {{MTR}}’s [[boss fantasy]] encourages him to continue searching. Meowth suddenly spots the duo, and soon enough Team Rocket recaptures their escapees with another drop net. Elekid tries an Electric attack to free itself, but the strategy fails as the net is engineered to withstand electricity. Larvitar resorts to {{m|Screech}}ing, and the ear-splitting noise alerts Ash and his friends to Team Rocket’s latest attempt. Casey has her Meganium to slice the net with a Razor Leaf. [[Jessie]] is infuriated and demands answers from James, who reveals that he swapped out the Razor Leaf-proof net for an electric-proof one. {{an|Brock}} orders out his {{TP|Brock|Forretress}}, and its {{m|Rapid Spin}} bursts Team Rocket\'s balloon and sends the evil trio blasting off. Ash and his friends rush to find Larvitar and Elekid, though they instead find the net entangled on a precarious cliff. The group decide to venture into the forest below to search for the missing pair.\n\nAfter being blasted off, the Rocket trio crash lands onto the [[Magikarp salesman]], who promptly begins his usual sales pitch. James, remembering his losses to the [[EP015|salesman\'s earlier scams]], demands a refund, but the salesman offers to [[trade]] them a [[List of Pokémon temporarily owned by the Team Rocket trio#Victreebel|Weepinbell]] that knows {{m|Sweet Scent}} as a substitute. Jessie and Meowth agree to this deal. The trio consider their options and force James to trade away his prized {{TP|James|Victreebel}} because of its annoying habit of latching onto James’s head. Jessie makes the trade with the Magikarp salesman. The dodgy salesman informs them that he won’t accept a trade back before quickly fleeing.\n\nWhile James mourns the loss of his beloved Pokémon, his new Weepinbell uses Sweet Scent, which attracts not only Elekid and Larvitar, but also Casey\'s Meganium and Ash\'s Pikachu. Following their Pokémon, Ash and his friends are able to catch up with Team Rocket and prevent them from escaping. Team Rocket then challenges them to a {{pkmn|battle}} over Larvitar and Elekid. After knocking {{AP|Phanpy}} down with a {{m|Vine Whip}}, Weepinbell [[Evolution|evolves]] into Victreebel and promptly eats Jessie. With the delay, Brock has his Forretress use Rapid Spin to free Larvitar and Elekid from the net. Jessie finally emerges from Victreebel\'s grasp and she orders {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}} to send it flying, much to James\'s dismay. Casey then orders her Meganium to use {{m|Solar Beam}}, sending Team Rocket blasting off once again. Meanwhile, the Magikarp salesman kicks away James\'s old Victreebel after it tries to eat him. It meets up with the second Victreebel in mid-air, and the two fall in love and happily bounce off into the forest together.\n\nAfter the group reunites with Elekid and Larvitar, Casey battles Elekid with her Meganium. Elekid uses its {{m|Thunder Punch}} attack to fend off Meganium\'s Razor Leaves. Meganium {{m|Tackle}}s Elekid before landing a direct Solar Beam on it. Elekid falls backwards and Casey pitches a {{i|Poké Ball}} at her target. Elekid enters the Ball, and after a few sways, Elekid is officially caught. As Casey holds up her newly {{pkmn2|caught}} Pokémon, Larvitar is feeling sad. Casey assures Larvitar that she will look after Elekid, which instantly cheers up the young Pokémon. Later, Casey declares that her new Elekid will help her earn more [[Badge]]s. She then sends Ash and his friends on their way with the theme song she uses to cheer on her favorite [[baseball]] team, the {{p|Electabuzz}}. However, the spirited gesture leaves the group overwhelmed.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} meet up with {{an|Casey}} again.\n* Casey\'s {{p|Bayleef}} is revealed to have evolved into a {{TP|Casey|Meganium}}.\n* [[James]] is forced to [[trade]] his {{TP|James|Victreebel}} for [[Magikarp salesman]]\'s {{DL|List of Pokémon temporarily owned by the Team Rocket trio|Victreebel|Weepinbell}}.\n* James\'s Weepinbell evolves into a new Victreebel.\n* [[Jessie]] blasts away James\'s new Victreebel.\n* The Magikarp salesman {{pkmn2|released|releases}} his Victreebel.\n* James\'s two Victreebel meet and fall in love.\n* Casey catches an {{p|Elekid}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Meganium}} ({{OP|Casey|Meganium}})\n\n=====TV episode debuts=====\n* {{p|Elekid}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n[[File:PMTV EP261.png|thumb|200px|{{tt|Pocket Monster TV|Who\'s That Pokémon}}]]\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{an|Giovanni}} ([[Boss fantasy|fantasy]])\n* {{an|Casey}}\n* [[Magikarp salesman]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP EP261.png|thumb|200px|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Hypno}} \'\'(US and international)\'\', {{p|Elekid}} \'\'(Japan)\'\'\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Togepi}} ({{OP|Misty|Togepi}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Bayleef}} ({{OP|Ash|Bayleef}})\n* {{p|Phanpy}} ({{OP|Ash|Phanpy}})\n* {{p|Forretress}} ({{OP|Brock|Forretress}})\n* {{p|Arbok}} ({{OP|Jessie|Arbok}})\n* {{p|Weezing}} ({{OP|James|Weezing}})\n* {{p|Magikarp}} ({{OP|James|Magikarp}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Weepinbell}} ({{OP|James|Weepinbell}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Victreebel}} ({{OP|James|Victreebel}}; traded to [[Magikarp salesman]]; released)\n* {{p|Weepinbell}} ({{DL|List of Pokémon temporarily owned by the Team Rocket trio|Victreebel|Magikarp salesman\'s}}; traded to James; evolves)\n* {{p|Victreebel}} ({{DL|List of Pokémon temporarily owned by the Team Rocket trio|Victreebel|James\'s}}; newly evolved; released)\n* {{p|Meganium}} ({{OP|Casey|Meganium}})\n* {{p|Elekid}} ({{an|Casey}}\'s; new)\n* {{p|Magikarp}} ({{OP|Magikarp salesman|Magikarp}})\n* {{p|Larvitar}} ([[Ash\'s Larvitar|anime]])\n\n==Trivia==\n* This is the first digitally animated episode, although digital animation was first used in the opening [[OK!]] and the corresponding English opening [[Pokémon Johto]] in \'\'[[EP117|Don\'t Touch That \'dile]]\'\', 144 episodes prior.\n** Even though this episode was digitally animated, the flashbacks of James\'s first Victreebel as a Weepinbell and his interaction with his Weepinbell at a hot tub and inside a double decker bed that were never shown on the anime before were still animated on cels. The same goes for [[EP015|the flashback of James receiving a]] {{TP|James|Magikarp}} from the [[Magikarp salesman]] and [[EP057|the flashback of James discovering his Victreebel at a Breeding Center]].\n** [[Jessie]]\'s hair is permanently changed from crimson to dark magenta from this episode onwards.\n* The dub title is a play on {{wp|Humphrey Bogart}}\'s line "Here\'s looking at you, kid" from the 1942 romantic drama film \'\'{{wp|Casablanca (film)|Casablanca}}\'\'.\n* Before the opening song begins (before the title card in the Japanese version), the partially visible Elekid is positioned in a way to resemble what was drawn by {{Tracey}} in \'\'[[EP103|Misty Meets Her Match]]\'\'.\n* Although {{p|Weepinbell}} evolves into Victreebel through the use of a [[Leaf Stone]], James\'s second Weepinbell evolves without one.\n* This is the latest episode to date where one of James\'s Pokémon has evolved under his ownership.\n* When {{an|Casey}} sings her song at the end, it is the first version of the Electabuzz song instead of the second one she sang at the [[Bug-Catching Contest]].\n* This is one of the few episodes in the original series where Team Rocket does not recite their motto in any form.\n* Casey catches Elekid [[EP161|exactly one hundred episodes after]] she was last seen obtaining {{TP|Casey|a Pokémon|Beedrill}}.\n* Music from \'\'[[PK01|Pikachu\'s Vacation]]\'\' and \'\'[[M02|The Power of One]]\'\' can be heard in this episode.\n* In the Japanese version, soon after {{an|Misty}} mentions that Casey is still an Electabuzz fan, Casey says "Hot Blooded Director 77", which is a reference to the {{wp|Hanshin Tigers}}\' (which the Electabuzz is based off), director at the time, {{wp|Senichi Hoshino}}\'s, special program, called "Senichi Hoshino\'s Hot Blooded Transcendent Night".\n\n===Errors===\n* In the English dub, the [[Pokédex]] says that Elekid is the evolved form of Electabuzz. Elekid actually evolves \'\'into\'\' {{p|Electabuzz}}; {{p|Electivire}} is the evolved form of Electabuzz.\n* When Brock sends out Forretress, its Poké Ball isn\'t the [[Fast Ball]] it was {{pkmn2|caught}} in.\n* In the flashback, James says, "You good for nothing carp!" However, in the [[EP016|actual episode]], he said, "You good for nothing fish!"\n* In one scene, Bayleef says something, but her mouth doesn\'t move.\n* When Jessie says that James said the net is made out of special steel, it was really Meowth that said it.\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|bg={{tt|Твой ред е, Елекид|It\'s your turn, Elekid}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|奈奈與電擊怪|Casey and Elekid}}\n|de={{tt|Elekid ist weg!|Elekid is gone!}}\n|nl={{tt|Alle Ogen op Elekid|All Eyes on Elekid}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Le doux parfum de l\'amitié|The soft perfume of friendship}}\n|he=הגנה חשמלית{{tt|hagana khashmalit|Electric Defense}}\n|it={{tt|Un Pokémon da catturare|A Pokémon to be caught}}\n|pl={{tt|Popatrz na siebie, Elekid|Look at you, Elekid}}\n|pt_br={{tt|A Amizade de Elekid|The Friendship of Elekid}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|O Campeonato das suas Vidas|The Championship of their Lifes}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Te estoy viendo Elekid!|I\'m looking at you Elekid!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Mi objetivo es Elekid|Elekid is my goal}}\n|hi=Casey ने पकड़ा Elekid को! {{tt|\'\'Casey ne pakda Elekid ko!\'\'|Casey caught Elekid!}} {{tt|*|Hindi title}}\n}}\n\n\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP260 |\nprevtitle=A Crowning Achievement |\nnextcode=EP262 |\nnexttitle=You\'re A Star, Larvitar |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Johto | }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0261}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|261]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Yukiyoshi Ōhashi]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Hiroaki Shimura]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Toshiaki Suzuki]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Izumi Shimura]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a main character obtains a new Pokémon]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a main character trades away a Pokémon]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a main character releases or gives away a Pokémon]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a main character\'s Pokémon evolves]]\n[[Category:Milestone episodes]]\n\n[[de:Elekid ist weg!]]\n[[es:EP263]]\n[[fr:EP261]]\n[[ja:無印編第261話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第262集]]'}
