It first aired in Japan on April 10, 2014, in the United Kingdom on June 15, 2014, and in the United States on June 21, 2014.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/17_22-going-for-the-gold/-->\n<i>Arriving at the seaside Ambrette Town while traveling to Cyllage City, our heroes are basking in the wonderful ocean breezes. Ash wants to train there with Froakie, but Serena has another idea: pay a visit to Ambrette Aquarium! Everyone agrees, and they marvel at the vast number of Water-type Pokémon there. They also meet a gentleman who tells them a little about the aquarium and shows them a statue of a golden Magikarp. He also directs them to the aquarium’s curator, Rodman, who’s fishing on the beach with his rather prickly Clauncher.\n\nRodman tells our heroes a local legend about a golden Magikarp who once rescued a diver in danger, and says he’s trying to catch it for the aquarium so everyone can see it! Ash, Serena, and Clemont want to help him catch it, and he happily hands out fishing rods. Of course, Team Rocket has been listening in on the conversation, and the villains want to catch the golden Magikarp for themselves...\n\nNo one is having any luck, so Clemont produces an invention to lure Magikarp in toward the shore. It’s not quite as fine-tuned as Clemont hoped, instead attracting several cranky Sharpedo. Not to be defeated, Clemont reveals yet another invention, determined that this next one will work right. And sure enough, all the fishing rods get a bite at the same time, and with a mighty effort, our heroes and Rodman reel in their catch—and it’s a golden Magikarp! Unfortunately, this one is Team Rocket’s new submarine, which they designed to fool the real golden Magikarp.\n\nAfter they send Jessie, James, and Meowth blasting off again, our heroes and Rodman are ready to call it a day. But just as they’re about to leave, a magnificent golden Magikarp leaps out of the water! Rodman is delighted to learn that the old story was really true, and promises our heroes that the next time they visit his aquarium, the golden Magikarp will be part of the exhibit!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrive at [[Ambrette Town]] and are met with a spectacular view of the sea. As {{an|Bonnie}} and some of the group\'s Pokémon play in the ocean, {{an|Serena}} suggests that the gang go to the Ambrette Aquarium. There they are told they can observe the ecology of many {{type|Water}} Pokémon, and Bonnie seizes the opportunity to ask the aquarium woman to marry her brother. Looking at the exhibits inside the aquarium, the group is in awe at the many species of Water Pokémon displayed up close. While looking at the {{p|Magikarp}} exhibit, an {{OBP|old man|XY022}} tells the travelers interesting facts about Water Pokémon and takes them to see the statue of the Golden Magikarp. When Ash inquires, the man tells them to go to the director of the aquarium, who is sitting on the beach, for more information about the statue. {{TRT}}, disguised as tourists, watches as the group races down to the beach and resolve to find out more about the Golden Magikarp.\n\nDown on the beach, the aquarium director introduces himself as [[Rodman]] and his partner, {{p|Clauncher}}. He says he is trying to fish for the real version of the Golden Magikarp. He tells the group of an ancient legend. At a time when fishing by holding your breath was popular, a fisherman was electrocuted by a {{p|Starmie}}, but was saved from drowning by a giant, golden, Magikarp. Since then, there have been occasional reports of the Magikarp being seen again. The director\'s dream is to capture the Golden Magikarp so that it can be viewed in the aquarium. Team Rocket, back in their uniforms, watch and listen from underwater in a Magikarp submarine, and decide to get the Golden Magikarp for themselves. Up on shore, Rodman releases a normal Magikarp and the travelers offer to help him. He gives Ash, Serena, and {{an|Clemont}} rods, and Ash teaches Serena how to fish. Later, Serena reels in a {{p|Corsola}}, but fails to capture it. Bonnie and {{TP|Clemont|Dedenne}} attempt to play with Clauncher, but soon it and Dedenne begin to fight, and Rodman tells them that it is not very friendly. \n\nTeam Rocket has made a submarine to look like the Golden Magikarp, and hope to trick the real thing into coming closer so that they can grab it with the submarine\'s claws. On the beach, Clemont works on a machine that sends out special soundwaves that attract Magikarp so that the fishers can catch them, however, it only manages to attract {{p|Sharpedo}}, which wreck the machine. Underwater in the golden submarine, Team Rocket attempts to catch a {{p|Starmie}}, which promptly electrocutes them. While nothing bites, Clemont unveils another improved machine for the same purpose as before, but it seems to have no reaction. Everyone feels a pull, however, as Team Rocket\'s submarine gets caught by their lines and surfaces. The group rejoices, thinking they have found the Golden Magikarp, but soon Team Rocket  emerges with their {{motto}} and decides to capture the group\'s Pokémon. The Pokémon at first manage to evade the submarine\'s claws, but Dedenne is grabbed. Before Ash can send Pikachu, Clauncher begins to attack the claws and rescues Dedenne. Team Rocket takes out {{p|Pumpkaboo}} and {{p|Inkay}}, but Clauncher dodges both of their attacks and Rodman commands it to use {{m|Water Gun}}, {{m|Crabhammer}} and {{m|Bubble Beam}} on after another. Ash and Pikachu finish Team Rocket with {{m|Thunderbolt}}.\n\nWhen the sun sets, the fishers decide to call it a day, and Rodman lets the travelers keep the fishing rods. As they thank him, the real Golden Magikarp leaps from the water. Rodman promises to have captured the Magikarp by the next time the travelers visit, and waves them off.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{an|Serena}} tries and fails to catch a {{p|Corsola}}.\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} each receive a [[fishing|fishing rod]] from [[Rodman]].\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Clauncher}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n[[File:Pokémon Quiz XY022.png|200px|thumb|right|Pokémon Quiz]]\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Serena}}\n* {{an|Clemont}}\n* {{an|Bonnie}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Rodman]]\n* {{OBP|Old man|XY022}}\n* {{pkmn|Trainer}}s\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP XY022.png|thumb|right|200px|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Clauncher}} \'\'(US and international)\'\'<br/>\n[[Pokémon Quiz]]: {{p|Clauncher}} \'\'(Japan)\'\'\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Dedenne}} ({{OP|Clemont|Dedenne}})\n* {{p|Froakie}} ({{OP|Ash|Froakie}})\n* {{p|Fennekin}} ({{OP|Serena|Fennekin}})\n* {{p|Pumpkaboo}} ({{OP|Jessie|Pumpkaboo}};
