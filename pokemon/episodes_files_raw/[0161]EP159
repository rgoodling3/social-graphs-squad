Revenge Battle!!\'\') is the 159th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on August 10, 2000 and in the United States on August 18, 2001. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/04_02-a-dairy-tale-ending/-->\n<i>Whitney takes our heroes to her uncle\'s Miltank farm in the outskirts of Goldenrod City. Here they sample the finest in Miltank dairy products and learn how to groom and care for these Pokémon. Ash realizes this is a great opportunity to study Miltank first-hand and hopes it will help him against Whitney\'s Miltank in their next battle. After learning about Miltank and coming out victorious in a battle against Team Rocket, Ash realizes the answer to overcoming Whitney\'s strongest Pokémon is good old-fashioned team-work.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter {{Ash}}\'s {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} recover, [[Whitney]] takes the group to spend a day at her uncle\'s dairy farm. Later, [[Jessie]], [[James]], and {{MTR}} attempt to raid the pantry for all of the dairy products they can find, but they are discovered by Whitney and forced to flee. Ash gives chase, and {{AP|Pikachu}} attacks the trio, causing them to drop the stolen food. Jessie and James send out {{p|Arbok}} and {{p|Weezing}}, and Whitney sends out Miltank. Miltank hits the trio with a {{m|Rollout}} and sends them flying. Later, the group is brushing the farm\'s Miltank, but the one Ash is brushing decides to walk away. Ash grabs its tail, and it responds by kicking him into a fence. Afterwards, Milton shows the group the milking machine.\n\nAs Whitney is practicing her Miltank\'s Rollout, Ash recalls how it made short work of his Pokémon in their earlier [[Gym]] {{pkmn|battle}}. Whitney\'s training is cut short, however, by {{TRT}}, who return in a giant rolling barrel. They recite their {{motto}} and use arms that sprout from the ends of the barrel to grab Miltank and Pikachu. Ash turns to face the barrel and sends out {{AP|Cyndaquil}}, which uses {{m|Tackle}}, stopping the barrel\'s advance. Ash then uses {{AP|Totodile}}\'s {{m|Water Gun}} to carve trenches in the hill. They cause the barrel to bounce and shake so violently that James snaps the control levers, dropping Miltank and Pikachu. Pikachu launches a {{m|Thunder Shock}}, which causes the barrel to explode, sending Team Rocket flying again.\n\nAsh and Whitney agree to have another battle, with Cyndaquil, Totodile, and Pikachu facing off against Miltank. Ash starts with Cyndaquil, but it is quickly defeated by Miltank\'s Rollout. Next, Ash uses Totodile and again has it use Water Gun to dig trenches in the ground. Totodile then launches itself into the air with another Water Gun and lands on top of Miltank. However, Whitney orders Miltank to shake it off, and she does before hitting it with Rollout. Ash returns the defeated Totodile to its [[Lure Ball]] before it even hits the ground. Finally, Ash sends out Pikachu and orders him to use {{m|Agility}}. Pikachu\'s speed causes Miltank to hit some of the trenches in her attempts to attack. As Miltank comes round for another attack, Pikachu positions himself at the bottom of one of the trenches. As Miltank rolls over the top, Pikachu tosses her into the air. Pikachu then uses Thunder Shock on the airborne Miltank and wins the match.\n\nWhitney offers Ash the {{Badge|Plain}}, much to his surprise, since it was not an official [[Gym]] battle. However, she and Milton convince him that beating a [[Gym Leader]]\'s top Pokémon fair and square is what counts, and he accepts it.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

When the Nurse Joy replies in the next shot, his arms are raised at chest-height.\n* Nurse Joy remarks about how well Ash\'s Totodile and Pikachu fared against Whitney compared to other Trainers\' Pokémon. She left out mention of Cyndaquil, even though all three were shown recovering.\n* Jessie says that they were on a magnet train when in fact they were on a magnet hand car.\n* When Whitney tells Ash that one Miltank hates having its tail grabbed, her socks disappear.\n* When Whitney and her Miltank train on a hill, Miltank uses Rollout down the hill, but appears to be spinning in the opposite direction. When she goes back up the hill, her spin is the same.\n* Whitney refers to a Miltank as "he", despite Miltank being an all-female species.\n* In the {{pmin|Poland|Polish}} dub, the {{Badge|Plain}} is simply referred to as a "\'\'Badge\'\'".\n\n<gallery>\nEP159 Error.png|Whitney\'s missing socks\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|bg={{tt|Край на млечната история|Dairy story end}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|大奶罐，復仇之戰|Miltank, Revenge Battle}}\n|cs={{tt|Konec mléčného příběhu|The end of the milky tale}}\n|nl={{tt|Hoe een Haas een Koe Vangt|How a Hare catches a Cow}}\n|de={{tt|Eine Revanche in Dukatia City|A revenge in Goldenrod City}}\n|fi={{tt|Jokaisessa asuu pieni Pokémon|Within everyone there lives a small Pokémon}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Des Pokémon très "lait"|Pokémon of very much milk}}\n|he=סיפור מחלבה{{tt|sipur machleva|Dairy Story}}\n|it={{tt|Latte per tutti|Milk for everybody}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Tudo Claro como o Leite|All Clear as the Milk}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Um Fim de Conto de Fadas|A Fairy Tale Ending}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Un final feliz!|A happy ending!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|El final del cuento de la lechera|The end of the milking-lady tale}}\n|sv={{tt|Miltank-mejeriet|The Miltank dairy}}\n|pl={{tt|Starcie w mleczarni|The showdown in dairy}}\n|hi=अंत भला तो सब भला! {{tt|\'\'Aant bhala toh sab bhala!\'\'|All\'s well that ends well!}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n}}\n\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP158 |\nprevtitle=A Goldenrod Opportunity |\nnextcode=EP160 |\nnexttitle=Air Time! |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Johto | }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0159}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|159]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Shinzō Fujita]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded and directed by Tarō Iwasaki]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Tarō Iwasaki]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Tarō Iwasaki]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Katsumi Hashimoto]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which Ash gets a Badge]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Ash]]\n[[Category:Episodes with Gym battles]]\n\n[[de:Revanche in Dukatia City]]\n[[es:EP161]]\n[[fr:EP159]]\n[[it:EP159]]\n[[ja:無印編第159話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第160集]]'}
