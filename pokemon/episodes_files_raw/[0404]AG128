Every Day a Heated Battle!\'\') is the 128th episode of the {{series|Advanced Generation}}, and the 402nd episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on May 12, 2005 and in the United States on March 18, 2006. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/08_35-shocks-and-bonds/-->\n<i>Ash, Tyson, and Morrison are all aiming for the top of the Hoenn League, but first they have to qualify for the Victory Tournament stage of the competition. In the third and final double battle qualification round, Ash sends out Glalie and Groyle against Clark, a conductor with two strong Fire-type Pokémon—Charizard and Quilava. Grovyle and Quilava are knocked out first, and it\'s an icy hot battle as Charizard and Glalie battle for victory! Thanks to Ash\'s quick thinking, Glalie bounces back for the win.\n\nMorrison and Tyson advance to the Victory Tournament, too. In fact, the only ones not getting anywhere are Team Rocket. It\'s hard to steal Pikachu when they\'re busy selling snacks at the stadium, but honest work has its rewards... a delicious dinner they didn\'t even have to steal! Meanwhile, the Trainers have a day off to see the sights and do some extra training.\n\nNow the Victory Tournament begins: 32 competitors, one winner! Ash\'s first opponent is Katie, a strategic Trainer who takes full advantage of type weaknesses and strengths. She starts out with Venomoth, but switches in Golduck to put Ash\'s Torkoal out of the match. Next up is Pikachu, but Katie counters with Dugtrio and sends Pikachu flying! Glalie knocks out Dugtrio, but is stopped by Misdreavus and its Destiny Bond attack. With Ash down three Pokémon and Katie only down two, will he be able to hang on to this match?</i>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the stadium, {{Ash}} orders {{AP|Grovyle}} and {{AP|Glalie}} to battle [[Clark]] and his  {{p|Quilava}} and {{p|Charizard}}. They attack directly, but end up taking damage from Charizard\'s {{m|Heat Wave}} and Quilava\'s {{m|Flame Wheel}}. Glalie\'s {{m|Icy Wind}} does not affect its opponents, but Charizard\'s {{m|Steel Wing}} doesn\'t hit its target either. Quilava manages to hit Glalie with {{m|Quick Attack}}, but Ash\'s Pokémon retaliate with {{m|Pound}} and {{m|Headbutt}}. Grovyle blocks Quilava\'s Quick Attack, while Charizard\'s Heat Wave and Glalie\'s Icy Wind collide and explode. Then, Grovyle uses Pound to knock out Quilava, but Charizard quickly defeats him with Steel Wing. Ash orders Glalie to use {{m|Ice Beam}} on the ground, forming ice pillars that stop Charizard\'s oncoming {{m|Flamethrower}}. Glalie then uses {{m|Double Team}} in the icy labyrinth to avoid damage, but Charizard succeeds in striking Glalie with Steel Wing. This sends it ricocheting from pillar to pillar, which Ash uses to his advantage. Glalie darts around the icy field and knocks out Charizard with a high-speed Headbutt, awarding Ash the victory.\n\nMorrison then meets up with Ash and both are excited to have won another battle. They leave to see how {{ho|Tyson}} is doing. Tyson and his opponent, [[Johnny]], are each down to their last Pokémon. Tyson\'s using his {{p|Sceptile}} against Johnny\'s {{p|Aggron}}. Sceptile uses {{m|Detect}} to evade a barrage of {{m|Metal Claw}} attacks, and when its opponent uses {{m|Harden}}, it charges up a {{m|Solar Beam}} that sends Aggron out of the fight, meaning that Tyson has also won his battle.\n\nAsh and his rivals, Morrison and Tyson, have now advanced to the third stage of the tournament. As they relax in the [[Pokémon Center]] cafeteria, Ash and Morrison are initially disappointed to learn that the next day will be a rest day. Nonetheless the pair use the day to their advantage to continue {{pkmn|training}} for the many [[Ever Grande Conference]] matches still to come, and competing against each other in several challenges like swimming. {{an|May}} and Tyson use the time to check out [[Ever Grande City]]’s food scene with [[Max]] in tow while {{an|Brock}}’s heart is aflutter with all of the [[Nurse Joy]]s and [[Officer Jenny]]s around.\n\nFrom now on, all of their matches will be [[Full Battle]]s; six-on-six matches on changing battlefields. The next day, Ash is getting ready to face his newest opponent, a girl named {{ho|Katie}}. The battlefield is selected by the computer as a craggy rock battlefield. Ash uses {{AP|Torkoal}} while Katie sends out a {{p|Venomoth}}. Torkoal blocks {{m|Stun Spore}} with its {{m|Iron Defense}}, which Venomoth renders unusable with {{m|Disable}}. Torkoal uses Flamethrower, but Katie quickly returns Venomoth and calls out {{p|Golduck}}. Ash orders Torkoal to use {{m|Body Slam}}, but Golduck sends Torkoal flying with a {{m|Hydro Pump}} and then cuts it down with {{m|Fury Swipes}}.\n\nWith Torkoal defeated, Ash sends {{AP|Pikachu}} into the arena. Katie responds by [[recall]]ing Golduck and sending out {{p|Dugtrio}}. Pikachu uses a {{m|Quick Attack}}, but Dugtrio {{m|Dig}}s to dodge, and then uses {{m|Sand Tomb}} to engulf the ground in an ever-growing sand trap. Sliding down the ominous pit, Pikachu uses {{m|Thunderbolt}} on Dugtrio to no avail. Before being swallowed up, Pikachu attacks with {{m|Iron Tail}} against Dugtrio\'s {{m|Double-Edge}}, but Pikachu is knocked out. Ash quickly picks up Pikachu and proceeds to send out Glalie. Dugtrio escapes underground, but is forced above by Glalie\'s powerful Headbutt on the ground. Using this opportunity, Glalie knocks it out with an Ice Beam. Katie sends out Misdreavus, but after taking an Ice Beam and a Headbutt, Misdreavus uses {{m|Destiny Bond}}. Misdreavus faints, but then suddenly Glalie glows purple and collapses as well. Ash now has three remaining Pokémon while Katie has four, so the match is set to [[AG129|continue]].\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}}, [[Morrison]], and {{ho|Tyson}} are revealed to have made it to the third qualifying round.\n* Ash defeats [[Clark]] in a [[Double Battle]], advancing to the Victory Tournament.\n* Morrison also defeats his opponent, advancing to the Victory Tournament.\n* Tyson defeats [[Johnny]] in a Double Battle, advancing to the Victory Tournament.\n* Tyson is revealed to own a {{p|Sceptile}} and a {{p|Donphan}}.\n* Ash begins his [[Full Battle]] against {{ho|Katie}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* {{ho|Katie}}\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Sceptile}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* {{Tracey}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Morrison]]\n* {{ho|Tyson}}\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* [[Officer Jenny]]\n* {{an|Professor Oak}}\n* {{Delia}}\n* [[Clark]]\n* [[Johnny]]\n* {{ho|Katie}}\n* [[Dominick]] (flashback)\n* [[Battle judge|Referee]]\n* Spectators\n* Team Rocket\'s employer\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:PTC AG128.png|thumb|200px|right|Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]\n[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]: {{p|Spheal}}\n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Swellow}} ({{OP|Ash|Swellow}})\n* {{p|Grovyle}} ({{OP|Ash|Grovyle}})\n* {{p|Corphish}} ({{OP|Ash|Corphish}})\n* {{p|Torkoal}} ({{OP|Ash|Torkoal}})\n* {{p|Glalie}} ({{OP|Ash|Glalie}})\n* {{p|Munchlax}} ({{OP|May|Munchlax}})\n* {{p|Mr. Mime}}  ({{Delia}}\'s; [[Mimey]])\n* {{p|Metang}} ({{OP|Morrison|Metang}})\n* {{p|Growlithe}} ([[Morrison]]\'s)\n* {{p|Girafarig}} ([[Morrison]]\'s)\n* {{p|Gligar}} ([[Morrison]]\'s)\n* {{p|Steelix}} ([[Morrison]]\'s)\n* {{p|Swampert}} ([[Morrison]]\'s)\n* {{p|Sceptile}} ({{ho|Tyson}}\'s; debut)\n* {{p|Charizard}} ([[Clark]]\'s)\n* {{p|Quilava}} ([[Clark]]\'s)\n* {{p|Aggron}} ([[Johnny]]\'s)\n* {{p|Venomoth}} ({{ho|Katie}}\'s)\n* {{p|Golduck}} ({{ho|Katie}}\'s)\n* {{p|Dugtrio}} ({{ho|Katie}}\'s)\n* {{p|Misdreavus}} ({{ho|Katie}}\'s)\n* {{p|Nidoking}} ({{pkmn|Trainer}}\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Venonat}} ({{pkmn|Trainer}}\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Persian}} ([[Vivica]]\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Golduck}} ({{pkmn|Trainer}}\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Machamp}} ({{pkmn|Trainer}}\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Grimer}} ({{pkmn|Trainer}}\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Marowak}} ([[Gavin]]\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Hitmonlee}} ({{OBP|Gilbert|AG126}}\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Hitmonchan}} ({{pkmn|Trainer}}\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Scyther}} ({{pkmn|Trainer}}\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Electabuzz}} ({{OBP|Jump|AG126}}\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Magmar}} ({{pkmn|Trainer}}\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Swalot}} ([[Dominick]]\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Tropius}} ([[Dominick]]\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{OP|Tyson|Meowth}}; flashback)\n\n==Trivia==\n* The title of this episode is a pun of "{{wp|stock}}s and {{wp|Bond (finance)|bonds}}".\n* The announcer mentions that {{AP|Glalie}}\'s finishing {{m|Headbutt}} against {{p|Charizard}} "looks like a [[critical hit]]".
