It first aired in Japan on October 21, 2018, in Canada on March 2, 2019, and in the United States on March 23, 2019 as the first episode of the twenty-second season, \'\'[[S22|Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon—Ultra Legends]]\'\'.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/22_01-lillier-and-the-staff/-->\n<i>Today is the sole performance of the Pokémon School play, and everyone’s so excited! Lillie stars as Lillier, a brave adventurer who is charged with restoring Alola’s lost energy using a staff imbued with the power of Legendary Pokémon. But Act Two takes an unexpected turn, as Jessie, in disguise as Jessa Bergère, crashes the performance to steal the spotlight for herself! After some confusion, Rotom Dex writes a magnificent new script on the fly, bringing the crowd (including Ash’s mom) to applause for a job well done!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nOutside the [[Pokémon School]], {{TRT}} is busy selling their honey-glazed donuts when a play script flies into [[Jessie]]\'s face. She reads the script and fantasizes about being an actress, while [[James]], {{MTR}}, and {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} look on in concern. Meanwhile, inside the Pokémon School, {{Ash}} and {{ashcl}} are getting ready for their play. Ash is unable to find his script, and {{Rotom}} gives him its own copy. Everyone begins practicing their lines in costume, but they soon become nervous after Rotom informs them that their families are waiting in the crowd. Ash and {{an|Mallow}} take a quick look, just as {{Delia}} and [[Mimey]] arrive. After [[Samson Oak]] welcomes the student\'s families and close friends to the school, the curtains open and the spotlight shifts as the play begins.\n\nMallow narrates as the play\'s protagonist, Lillier—played by {{an|Lillie}}—arrives before King Sosophocles and Queen Tsareena, played by {{an|Sophocles}} and {{TP|Mallow|Tsareena}}, respectively. The King and the Queen grant Lillier the Staff of [[Alola]] to gather the power of the [[Legendary Pokémon]]. In the next scene, Lillier meets the [[guardian deities]], played by Ash, Mallow, {{an|Lana}}, and Sophocles. Lillier asks the quartet to bestow power on her. Delia calls out to her son, causing Ash to become nervous and temporarily forget his lines, but Mallow reminds him, and the guardian deities call for the Pokémon of Alola, who all start dancing. The play continues with a dance scene between the King and the Queen, then Lillier travels far and wide, until eventually, she meets the Legendary {{p|Solgaleo}}, played by {{an|Kiawe}}, atop a mountain.\n\nJessie makes a grand entrance and flies onto the stage [[List of Team Rocket\'s disguises|disguised]] as {{p|Lunala}} with James, Meowth, and Wobbuffet holding the supporting rope. The crowd is in awe, but the students are left shocked by the unexpected appearance and Rotom declares the end of Act One before closing the stage curtains. Kiawe demand answers, to which Jessie claims herself to be the great actress Jessa-Bergère and insists the play continues with her re-written lines that gives Jessie all the scene time. The kids are against it, but Rotom solves the problem by deciding to come up with a new script and begins scanning its database for ideas. The students soon spot the rest of Team Rocket trying to sneak away and rope them into joining the school\'s play.\n\nAct Two opens with a [[baseball]] scene. Soon enough, the play descends into a mismatch of themes and multiple acts starring [[Ultra Beast]]s, {{tc|Police Officer}}s, shadows, and Alolan Detective [[Laki]], but the crowd loves it.\n\nEventually the play reaches its final scene where Lillier seeks the power of the moon from Lunala. Jessie spins around while rose petals are blown around her to create a mystical and enchanting performance. Meowth suddenly loses grip of the rope holding Jessie, but thankfully {{an|Bewear}} appears and stops her from falling. After Jessie bestows the moon\'s power onto Lillier and declares that she must now return to the moon, Bewear tugs on the rope and sends her flying out of the school\'s concert hall. Bewear then scoops up James, Meowth, and Wobbuffet in her arms before jumping out of the building. She soon reaches Jessie mid-air before leaping into the distance. Despite Jessie\'s sudden exit, the play goes on and Lillier declares that Alola has been saved and peace has been restored. As the applause and cheers grow louder, the students and their Pokémon assemble onstage and thank the audience.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
