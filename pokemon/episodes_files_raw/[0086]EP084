It was first broadcast in Japan on February 18, 1999 and in the United States on January 22, 2000. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/02_30-the-lost-lapras/-->\n<i>After picking up the GS Ball from Professor Ivy, Brock decided to stay on the island so Ash and Misty head back home by blimp. Unfortunately, our duo gets double-crossed by Team Rocket once again, and Jigglypuff puts the whole crew to sleep. After another crash landing in the middle of nowhere they meet a new friend named Tracey while trying to help a Lapras that washed up on the beach.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter the events of the [[EP083|previous episode]], {{Ash}} and {{an|Misty}} are freed from their cage after the blimp overturns in a crash-landing. As they exit the wreck, only to find themselves surrounded by a dense tropical forest. The pair trek for miles, and Misty fears it is a deserted island and they will have to eat bugs and {{Berries}}. Suddenly, a group of elderly tourists appear and pose for photos with {{AP|Pikachu}} and {{TP|Misty|Togepi}}. Ash and Misty stumble upon the {{an|Pokémon Park}}\'s entrance gate and are greeted by two woman in hula skirts, who put leis on the group. An announcement over a speaker confirms that Ash and Misty are on [[Tangelo Island]], much to their relief.\n\nThey stroll along the city\'s waterfront and stop after Pikachu notices a {{p|Lapras}} stranded on the beach. [[Three punks|Three men]] are verbally and physically abusing it, with one hitting it with a stick. Ash and Misty confront them, though the situation quickly grows hostile as the men reveal that they want the Lapras so they can use it to {{pkmn|battle}} the [[Orange League|Orange Crew]]. The trio sends out their {{p|Spearow}}, {{p|Hitmonchan}}, and {{p|Beedrill}}. Ash pits Pikachu against all three, but before any attacks are launched, someone calls out for them to stop. He steps forward, measuring and sketching all of the {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. He quickly points out that Spearow is vitamin-deficient, Beedrill\'s coloring is poor, and Hitmonchan is lacking exercise. He contrasts the underdeveloped Pokémon with Pikachu, noting the shiny coat. The trio gets irritated and order all three Pokémon to attack, but Pikachu takes the three Pokémon down and sends them scurrying with a {{m|Thunder Shock}}. However, the watcher quickly shifts his attention to the Lapras. He hands Ash medicine while he runs to get [[Nurse Joy]]. Ash offers Lapras the medicine, but its knocks it away, with Pikachu catching it before it breaks.\n\nAt the [[Pokémon Center]], Nurse Joy concludes that Lapras only needs a rest, but she reveals that it is afraid to have any human contact, probably based on how the three men were abusing it. The watcher points out that it is only an infant and that it might have gotten separated from its group after the last big storm. He reveals that he is a [[Pokémon watcher]] and that he observes Pokémon in their natural habitats. Ash and Misty introduce themselves, and the watcher introduces himself as {{Tracey}}. Ash and the others decide to work together in returning Lapras to its group. Meanwhile, {{TRT}} watches nearby and decides to steal Lapras.\n\nThree kids run in and ask Nurse Joy to heal their Pokémon in preparation for battling the Orange Crew. Tracey tells Ash about the Orange Crew and how Trainers must beat every member before competing in the [[Orange League]]. Ash wants to compete, but Misty reminds him that they need to deliver the [[GS Ball]] to {{an|Professor Oak}}. Ash places a call to Oak, presenting the GS Ball and requesting to compete in the Orange League. After Oak concedes, Tracey declares himself a part of {{ashfr|the group}} in the hopes of eventually meeting Oak, his idol. As Misty objects, Nurse Joy tells the group that Lapras is awake and feeling much better.\n\nThe group wants to load Lapras aboard a truck to take it back to sea, but Lapras is afraid to move. Ash decides to sing a lullaby, but {{an|Jigglypuff}} comes up and beats him to it, putting everyone to sleep with {{m|Sing}}. Jigglypuff gets angry and doodles on everyone\'s faces, even ruining Tracey\'s sketch. After everyone wakes up, Lapras still won\'t budge from the Center pool. Ash tries to get close to Lapras, but it retreats underwater. Ash takes off his [[Ash\'s hat|hat]] and vest before jumping in and swimming after Lapras. Lapras evades Ash, forcing him to resurface for air. Just then, Team Rocket fires a smoke pellet into the pool, creating a white smokescreen as they tie Lapras to their own truck. As Tracey is amazed at {{MTR}}\'s talking ability, [[James]] orders {{TP|James|Weezing}} to use {{m|Smog}}, allowing them to escape in their truck. Tracey sends out {{TP|Tracey|Venonat}} to use its radar eyes to track the truck before they can pursue.\n\nWhile Team Rocket follows the steep cliff roads, Ash and his friends cut across the hilly landscape on [[bicycle]]s. Ash gets close enough for him to jump off his bike and directly onto the truck bed. Ash moves forward and climbs inside the cabin, while Misty and Tracey stop pursuing due to fatigue. Pikachu attacks with {{m|Thunderbolt}}, which knocks James out, and he accidentally presses a switch that detaches the trailer. Ash and Pikachu get back onto the truck bed as they head up a ramp. James brakes as the truck heads towards a steep cliff edge, but the momentum of the truck bed with Lapras behind them is enough to push Team Rocket off and they are sent blasting off. While the trailer doesn\'t follow suit, as Ash loosens the rope binding Lapras, it begins to roll backwards and towards another steep drop. Ash clambers to the side, and his weight helps shift and turn the trailer in time to prevent a descent. However, they quickly approach another cliff and the same technique fails. Ash and Pikachu grab onto Lapras just before all three crash into the sea.\n\nMisty and Tracey follow Venonat\'s senses, which lead them to the beach. In the distance, Ash and Pikachu arrive on Lapras\'s back. Nurse Joy notes that Lapras appears to be comfortable around Ash, and he proclaims that {{AP|Lapras}} has been {{pkmn2|caught}}. Tracey joins Ash and Misty as they leave Tangelo Island.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

However, after {{Tracey}} examines them, the Hitmonchan is in the middle with the Spearow on the left.\n* When Ash calls {{an|Professor Oak}}, he initially has the phone against his ear. However, in all subsequent scenes during the call, the receiver is nowhere to be seen.\n* When Ash is riding the bike after Team Rocket, he jumps off. No one moved to avoid the bike, even though they would have flipped over it.\n* When Ash jumps back out of the cab of the car, the hitch is still attaching the bed and the cab of the car even though it was released earlier.\n* When Team Rocket appears in the car, [[James]]\'s boot is gray instead of black.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* In the original version, the hula girls who give Ash and {{an|Misty}} the leis tell them \'\'oniai desu yo\'\'. They could either be saying "these look good on you", or "you guys match well", a term used to refer to a matching couple. In the dub, the girls only welcome Ash and Misty to the park.\n* [[Pikachu\'s Jukebox]]: [[Double Trouble]]\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FFDDAA|bordercolor=FFBB55\n|zh_cmn={{tt|拯救乘龍|Saving Lapras}}\n|cs={{tt|Ztracený Lapras|The Lost Lapras}}\n|da={{tt|Den forsvundne Lapras|The lost Lapras}}\n|nl={{tt|De Verdwaalde Lapras|The Lost Lapras}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Pokémon en détresse|Pokémon in distress}}\n|de={{tt|Das verlorene Lapras|The lost Lapras}}\n|he=הלפרס האבודה {{tt|\'\'Ha\'Lapras ha\'avuda\'\'|The lost Lapras}}\n|hi=गुमशुदा Lapras {{tt|\'\'Gumshuda Lapras\'\'|Missing Lapras}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n|hu={{tt|Az elveszett Lapras|The Lost Lapras}}\n|it={{tt|Un cucciolo ferito|A wounded pup}}\n|no={{tt|Den bortkomne Lapras|The lost Lapras}}\n|pl={{tt|Zagubiony Lapras|The lost Lapras}}\n|pt_br={{tt|O Lapras Perdido|The Lost Lapras}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|O Lapras Perdido|The Lost Lapras}}\n|ro={{tt|Lapras-ul Pierdut|The Lost Lapras}}\n|ru={{tt|Потерявшийся Лапрас|Lost Lapras}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡El Lapras perdido!|The lost Lapras!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|El Lapras perdido|The lost Lapras}}\n|sv={{tt|Lugn, lilla Lapras|Easy now, little Lapras}}\n|tr={{tt|Kayıp Lapras|Lost Lapras}}\n}}\n{{-}}\n\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP083 |\nprevtitle=Poké Ball Peril |\nnextcode=EP085 |\nnexttitle=Fit to be Tide |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Orange}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0084}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|084]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Shinzō Fujita]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded and directed by Kiyotaka Itani]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Kiyotaka Itani]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Kiyotaka Itani]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Hiroshi Sakai]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a main character is introduced]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a main character joins the group]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a main character obtains a new Pokémon]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Ash]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Tracey]]\n\n[[de:Das verlorene Lapras]]\n[[es:EP086]]\n[[fr:EP084]]\n[[it:EP084]]\n[[ja:無印編第84話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第85集]]'}
