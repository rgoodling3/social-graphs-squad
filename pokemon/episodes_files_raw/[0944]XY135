It first aired in Japan on September 15, 2016 as a one-hour special alongside [[XY136]] and in the United States on December 10, 2016.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/19_42-rocking-kalos-defenses/-->\n<i> Team Flare appears to be defeated for now—Clemont has destroyed their control system at great personal cost, and Alain and Ash have battled Lysandre to a standstill. But as the villain disappears, he promises that his new world will come to pass...\n\nMeanwhile, Mairin and Serena rescue Chespie—only to watch in horror as it’s absorbed by the mysterious Giant Rock, which changes shape to resemble Zygarde! It begins to move, heading toward the Anistar Sundial in search of more energy. Everyone is determined to stop it at all costs—including the Gym Leaders and Champion Diantha, as they join our heroes to rescue Chespie and save the world!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nContinuing the {{pkmn|battle}}, [[Lysandre]]\'s {{me|Gyarados}} uses {{m|Hyper Beam}}, but {{AP|Pikachu}} dodges and uses {{m|Quick Attack}}. The Atrocious Pokémon is finally knocked by a combination of [[Alain\'s Charizard|Mega Charizard X]]\'s {{m|Dragon Claw}} and {{AP|Greninja}}\'s {{m|Cut}}, followed by Pikachu\'s {{m|Thunderbolt}}. [[Alain]] claims that the fighting instinct Lysandre spoke of is a thing of the past, but the [[Team Flare]] Boss remarks that he is still intent on recreating the world. Then, he walks to the edge of [[Lumiose Gym|Prism Tower]] and jumps off. Greninja tries to rescue him with its tongue, but misses. [[Malva]] is shocked by Lysandre\'s move and falls to her knees. {{Ash}} receives a call from {{an|Serena}}, who informs him about the success of their quest. Serena then asks Ash to go to the Lumiose Gym and check on {{an|Clemont}}.\n\nMeanwhile, {{TRT}} is still in their battle with [[Team Flare]]. [[Celosia]] and [[Mable]] tell {{p|Drapion}} and {{p|Weavile}} to use {{m|Sludge Bomb}} and {{m|Ice Beam}} respectively, but [[Jessie]] has her {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} counter by using {{m|Mirror Coat}}, and [[James]] shoots a net to capture the Team Flare scientists and their {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. Meanwhile, Serena and her group mates have reached the [[Giant Rock]], where {{Steven}} is trying to study the nature of the research conducted on the Rock. Suddenly, it starts to glow red, and the glass containing it shatters; [[Chespie]] is pulled towards and is absorbed by the Rock. {{an|Professor Sycamore}} attempts to stop [[Mairin]] from approaching the Rock as it changes its shape. The phenomenon causes the building to start collapsing, and everyone flees. Once outside, everyone notices the transformed Rock completely destroy the building, causing Mairin to worry about Chespie. Steven is certain that the Rock is the source of the event, and claims that anything can happen now. With the Rock wrecking havoc in the [[Lysandre Labs]], {{tc|Team Flare Grunt}}s and {{tc|Team Flare Admin}}s run away from the Labs, along with Team Rocket who flees on the helicopter and decide to continue with reporting the disaster. In [[Anistar City]], [[Olympia]] and her {{p|Meowstic}} note the the Anistar City {{DL|Anistar City|Sundial}} glowing red, and Olympia describes it as "trembling". Meanwhile, Ash and Alain have reached the Lumiose Gym and notice Clemont grieving over [[Clembot]]\'s destroyed body. Ash asks if Clembot can be repaired, but Clemont states that he will try his best, and that he hasn\'t been of any use so far. Serena calls Ash to inform about the Giant Rock; he, Alain and Clemont learn that it has absorbed Chespie, shocking both Ash and Alain, and has started out for [[Anistar City|somewhere]]. Professor Sycamore sends them the co-ordinates and asks them to reach the site with [[Meyer|Blaziken Mask]]. When the call disconnects, Ash asks Clemont if he would like to join, and Clemont agrees, stating that the battle is not over just yet.\n\n[[Squishy]] and {{an|Bonnie}} eventually catch up with an exhausted [[Z2]]. Bonnie tries to greet Z2, but it gets startled, and runs away. It confronts Squishy and remarks about the evilness of human beings, but Squishy states that it believes in humans, as they have not given up yet. Bonnie approaches Z2 and attempts to lift it up in her arms, but Z2 is indecisive. Squishy explains how being with Bonnie allowed it to witness the hard work of people and Pokémon, and the trust between them, to achieve happiness, claiming that the humans it travels with, never give up. An excited Bonnie picks up Z2 and starts tickling it, as Blaziken Mask and Mega {{p|Blaziken}} watch from a distance, when they are approached by Ash, Alain, Clemont, and Malva in a helicopter.\n\nProfessor Sycamore and Steven report their findings to the group, and explain that the energy of the [[Giant Rock]] strongly resembles Zygarde, and since Chespie had fallen into coma due to absorbing a part of Zygarde\'s energy, it absorbed Chespie, to obtain that energy back. They also claim that the Rock, in search of its new energy source, is headed towards the Anistar City Sundial, which contains energy similar to the energy Pokémon emit during [[Mega Evolution]]. Blaziken Mask wonders why the Rock is headed towards the Sundial in particular, and Professor Sycamore explains that the Rock and Sundial, coming in direct contact, would emit enough energy to destroy the world. Ash refuses to let such an event take place, and claims that they can and will stop the Giant Rock and rescue Chespie. Alain, also, comforts Mairin, claiming that he will rescue Chespie for her sake.\n\nAt the Anistar City Sundial, [[Officer Jenny]] and Olympia inspect the situation and decide to evacuate the residents of the city. With Team Rocket reporting the movement of the Giant Rock, Professor Sycamore, Steven and Serena try to destroy the Rock with their Pokémon, and send out {{p|Garchomp}}, {{TP|Steven|Metagross}}, and {{TP|Serena|Braixen}}. After Mega Evolving their Pokémon, Professor Sycamore and Steven command them to use {{m|Dragon Pulse}} and {{m|Flash Cannon}}, while Serena has her Braixen use {{m|Flamethrower}}, but the Rock summons vines to shield itself. The Rock attacks them with vines but they evade and destroy them. However, the vines eventually manage to subdue Mega Garchomp and Mega Metagross, and Braixen is knocked off the Iron Leg Pokémon. Nevertheless, she is saved in the nick of time by Alain\'s Mega Charizard X and Ash\'s Pikachu. Mega Charizard X and Pikachu use Flamethrower and {{m|Iron Tail}} to free the captured Pokémon. In [[Lumiose City]], {{an|Tierno}}, {{an|Trevor}}, {{an|Shauna}}, and [[Sawyer]] watch the event involving the Rock, and Sawyer wishes Ash to take care. Concurrently, the energy emitted from the Sundial causes the port to start melting. Ash and Greninja have managed to locate Chespie within the core of the Rock, and Greninja pin points Chespie\'s location with a {{m|Water Shuriken}} for others to target the spot; the Rock, however, keeps attacking the Pokémon with the vines, and the Pokémon are left being engaged in keeping the vines at bay. The Rock eventually manages to capture the Pokémon, but they are rescued by a massive attack, which to Team Rocket\'s utter surprise, is revealed to have come from all the other seven [[Gym Leader]]s and the [[Kalos]] {{pkmn|Champion}}, [[Diantha]]\'s, Pokémon. However, Diantha realizes that the combined attack did not have much of an effect on the Rock, and decides to talk with everyone to come up with a different plan.\n\nDiscussing their next move, Steven informs Diantha and the Gym Leaders about the target Water Shuriken, and wishes to use the Pokémon\'s powers to get through, as Steven and Diantha thank each other for their help. [[Korrina]] greets Ash and discusses about {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Greninja|Ash-Greninja}}, and Olympia congratulates him for eventually controlling the power that comes along with [[Bond Phenomenon]]. With the Giant Rock advancing towards the Sundial, Diantha advises everyone to realize their responsibility in defending the Sundial, and prevent it from coming in contact with the Rock. Malva calls out her {{p|Houndoom}} for assistance as well. Ash asks Serena to take care of Mairin and Bonnie, and Alain assures Mairin that he will return safely with Chespie. In their helicopter, Jessie and {{MTR}} comment on the spectacular defense put up in favor of Kalos, as everyone seems ready to fight for the safety of the world.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
