It first aired in Japan on August 11, 2016 and in the United States on October 29, 2016.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/19_37-finals-not-for-the-faint-hearted/-->\n<i>The long-anticipated Kalos League finals are getting under way, as Ash faces off against Alain in a full six-on-six battle! The two seem evenly matched, trading one knockout after another: Pikachu beats Tyranitar and then switches out for Noivern, who falls to Alain’s Weavile. Hawlucha defeats Weavile, then loses to Alain’s Bisharp. Next, Ash’s Talonflame and Alain’s Unfezant knock each other out after a spectacular aerial battle, and it’s tied at three and three!\n\nPikachu returns to face the massive Metagross—and shows amazing determination as it hangs on for the win! Then, Alain calls on his partner Charizard, and both Pokémon are confident and excited for the battle ahead!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nFor the final {{pkmn|battle}} of the [[Lumiose Conference|Kalos League]], the announcer calls out {{Ash}} and [[Alain]] to the stadium; [[Mairin]] cheers for Alain through the sidelines. Facing off, Ash and Alain are excited to battle each other, with no finalist in a mood to hold back for their friend. The first battlefield for the final is a water and rock field. The [[Battle judge|referee]] announces the rules of the battle, and asks the {{pkmn|Trainer}}s to bring out their Pokémon. Ash chooses his {{AP|Pikachu}}, while Alain sends out his {{p|Tyranitar}}, activating its {{a|Sand Stream}}. {{an|Clemont}} sees this as a tactic by Alain to disrupt the vision of Pikachu and prevent it from attacking and moving around, but {{an|Serena}} is not worried, and {{an|Bonnie}} cheers for Ash and Pikachu. \n\nAlain begins the battle by commanding a {{m|Dark Pulse}} from his Tyranitar; Pikachu avoids the attack. Ash sees a strategy and has Pikachu use {{m|Iron Tail}} on the stream of water. The splash from the water clears away the {{weather|sandstorm}}, while soaking the Armor Pokémon, causing {{m|Thunderbolt}} to deal more damage. Pikachu follows up with {{m|Electro Ball}}, which is countered by a {{m|Stone Edge}} from Tyranitar, and Alain has his Pokémon smash the stones with its tail, sending a barrage of stone pieces at the Mouse Pokémon, only to be reflected back with Iron Tail. Tyranitar follows up with {{m|Crunch}}, but Pikachu uses Iron Tail; Tyranitar, however, grabs his tail in its mouth and swings it back. Pikachu retaliates with Electro Ball, and thus, causes the Armor Pokémon to faint. [[Ash\'s friends]] are excited at an early lead, and [[Diantha]] commends Ash on his fighting  skills since the semi-finals, something with {{an|Professor Sycamore}} seems to agree with. He then remembers his conversation with Alain, and wonders what feelings the latter is holding inside him. Meanwhile, {{TRT}} is still intent on their plan to steal the finalists\' Pokémon after the battle, while [[Malva]] calls them out for the next shot.\n\nAsh recalls Pikachu, and sends out his {{AP|Noivern}} on the battlefield, while Alain sends out his {{p|Weavile}}. Noivern uses {{m|Supersonic}} but Weavile uses {{m|Protect}} to protect itself, and follows up with {{m|Night Slash}}. Noivern uses Supersonic again, connecting this time around. Alain has Weavile use {{m|Ice Beam}}, but Noivern counters with {{m|Boomburst}}, and follows up with {{m|Dragon Claw}}. Feeling cornered, Weavile uses {{m|Double Team}} to evade the Sound Wave Pokémon, but the latter uses {{m|Supersonic}} to successfully find the real one, and proceeds to attack it with Dragon Claw. Weavile avoids the attack, and counters with Ice Beam. After some swift dodging, Noivern eventually gets hits by the move, and falls in the stream of water; he is then attacked by Night Slash, and is knocked out.\n\nAsh sends out his {{AP|Hawlucha}} to battle next, who uses {{m|Karate Chop}} to attack the Sharp Claw Pokémon, but Hawlucha misses every strike. Weavile successfully leads him in the water and uses Ice Beam at his feet, but the Wrestling Pokémon avoids the attack. However, the Ice Beam manages to freeze the stream of water, so that Hawlucha has difficulty walking over it. Weavile uses another Ice Beam, and Hawlucha takes the super-effective hit head on. Weavile follows up with another Night Slash, but Hawlucha blocks it; Clemont notes that Hawlucha is using the ice to reduce the damage from attacks. Weavile uses Night Slash again, knocking Hawlucha backwards, but Ash is unconcerned and claims that Hawlucha gets stronger by taking his opponent\'s attacks. Alain asks Weavile to use Night Slash again, but Hawlucha responds this time by flying towards the Sharp Claw Pokémon, and throwing it onto the battlefield. Hawlucha then uses {{m|Flying Press}} to successfully knock Weavile out, while inadvertently breaking off the ice as well. Serena, Clemont and [[Sawyer]] talk about the trust between Ash and his Pokémon, and [[Lysandre]] takes a note of the strength of Ash\'s Pokémon. Mairin shouts a cheer for Alain, as he sends out his {{p|Bisharp}} to battle, which uses {{m|Thunder Wave}} to {{status|Paralysis|paralyze}} the Wrestling Pokémon. Alain has Bisharp use {{m|Guillotine}}; Hawlucha retaliates with {{m|X-Scissor}}, and the two Pokémon collide head-on. Hawlucha tries to use {{m|High Jump Kick}} but misses, and Bisharp uses Guillotine to knock out Hawlucha. {{an|Tierno}} and {{an|Trevor}} note Alain\'s strength as Ash and Alain recall their Pokémon; an excited Alain remarks to himself how battling with Ash involves a lot of fun for him and makes him forget about time completely.\n\nAlain sends out his {{p|Unfezant}} next, while Ash calls out his {{AP|Talonflame}}. The Proud Pokémon and the Scorching Pokémon have a little exhibition of their flying prowess, before their Trainers command them to use {{m|Steel Wing}}. The two collide, then begin flying against each other again. Ash commands a {{m|Flame Charge}} in order to allow Talonflame to build up speed and move ahead of Unfezant, and Alain responds by having Unfeazant power up with a {{m|Sky Attack}}. The two moves counter eah other, after which Alain has Unfezant use {{m|Air Slash}} next. Unfeazant allows Talonflame to move ahead of it in order to set it up for an easy attack, and while Talonflame swiftly dodges most of the projectiles still takes a hit. Talonflame retaliates with another Flame Charge next, successfully hitting the Proud Pokémon. Unfezant uses Sky Attack while Ash has his Talonflame use {{m|Brave Bird}}, and the head-on collision of moves knocks both Pokémon out.\n\nWith only three Pokémon left per side, the battlefield goes down for changing. Clemont expresses his concern about the fate of the battle, and Trevor remarks that one little mistake can change the course of the battle. Clemont reveals to Tierno, Trevor, and {{an|Shauna}} that Ash has never managed to defeat Alain, leading Shaunto wonder about the latter\'s strength, but Serena asserts her own belief, stating that Ash\'s strength has increased a lot since [[XY116|the last time Ash and Alain battled]]. On the battlefield, Pikachu cheers on Ash, and the latter encourages Alain to have fun to the end. Alain smiles, and remarks to himself about Ash\'s sportsmanship. Mairin notices Alain smiling, revealing that she had never seen him smile before. Lysandre comments that the finals are about to reach the climax, and that every eye will be upon [[Lumiose City]].\n\nThe new battlefield is revealed to be a grass-field. Ash sends out his Pikachu to face off against Alain\'s {{p|Metagross}}. Pikachu begins the battle by using Thunderbolt, but Metagross uses {{m|Agility}} to evade the attack and constantly cut off Pikachu when he tries to get some distance. Metagross strikes Pikachu with {{m|Metal Claw}}, and follows up another hit with {{m|Rock Slide}}. A damaged Pikachu moves the rocks away, and is hit by a {{m|Meteor Mash}}. Still hanging on, the Mouse Pokémon counters another Meteor Mash with an Electro Ball, and then jumps atop the Iron Leg Pokémon. Metagross tries to shake Pikachu off, but Pikachu\'s hold is tight, who uses Thunderbolt to deal serious damage. After some effort, and encouragement from its Trainer, Metagross manages to shake Pikachu off itself, but the latter uses Iron Tail on the heavily damaged Metagross, and successfully knocks it out. Mairin seems displeased at the loss, while the group in the sidelines is happy that Ash has taken the lead once again. Diantha and Professor Sycamore praise Ash for his cleverness; [[James]] is happy as well that Pikachu has won, something which does not seem to please [[Jessie|his]] {{MTR|teammates}}. \n\nFor his next Pokémon, Alain sends out his {{TP|Alain|Charizard}}, worrying Ash\'s friends. Ash has his Pikachu use {{m|Quick Attack}} to hit the Flame Pokémon, followed by a super effective Thunderbolt, bringing Charizard to its knees. Serena wishes luck to Ash and Pikachu, and everyone watches with utter curiosity as the Kalos League finals are reaching their absolute climax.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
