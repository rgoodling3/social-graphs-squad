VS {{tt|Huuro|Skyla}}, A Decisive Air Battle!!\'\') is the 68th episode of the {{series|Best Wishes}}, and the 725th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on March 1, 2012 and in the United States on June 30, 2012.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/15_20-an-amazing-aerial-battle/-->\n<i>After some convincing by a group of young challengers and Skyla’s grandfather, Skyla takes Ash up on his Gym Battle challenge. Skyla remains convinced she’s going to win (after mentally envisioning what Pokémon Ash will use), but Ash has other ideas! The three-on-three match begins with Ash’s Krokorok versus Skyla’s Swoobat. Swoobat’s aerial attacks prove to be too much for Krokorok, and Ash is soon down one Pokémon.\n\nNext, Ash chooses Tranquill, in a battle of two Flying types! They appear to be evenly matched, but Tranquill’s speed quickly proves to be too much for Swoobat, who’s worn out from its first battle.\n\nWhen Skyla calls for Unfezant, Ash switches Tranquill out for Pikachu—and Pikachu takes Unfezant down easily with a supereffective Electro Ball! Skyla calls on her Swanna next, and Ash is preparing for a quick victory—but Skyla has figured out how to overcome Swanna’s huge type disadvantage, and uses Aqua Ring to deflect Pikachu’s Electric-type attacks! Pikachu just can’t get through Swanna’s defenses, and Swanna is victorious.\n\nBut it’s not over yet, because Ash’s Tranquill can still battle! At first it struggles against the much faster Swanna—but in the heat of battle, it evolves into Unfezant! This amazing event makes things much more evenly matched, and a fierce Flying-type battle ensues. Unfezant’s new moves prove to be too much for Swanna, and Ash wins the match!\n\nAfter awarding Ash the Jet Badge and resolving to battle for real from now on, Skyla tells him the closest Gym is in Icirrus City. Our heroes decide to make that their next destination, and Ash is excited to realize that he only needs two more badges to enter the Unova League!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} reveals his choices for his [[Gym]] {{pkmn|battle}} against [[Skyla]]: {{p|Tranquill}}, {{AP|Krokorok}}, and {{AP|Pikachu}}. Skyla commends Ash for his well-balanced team, but she believes that she will win so there will be no point in battling. However, the [[Pokémon Trainer]]s who were spectating the earlier battle between Cilan and Skyla want to see Skyla battle Ash, allowing Ash to skip all of their turns to watch another true battle. With some convincing from {{an|Miles}} as well as {{TP|Skyla|Swanna}}\'s agreement, Skyla accepts Ash\'s challenge. Skyla runs through an Air Battle and deduces that Krokorok, with {{t|Flying}}\'s immunity to {{type|Ground}} moves, Krokorok will lose to her {{p|Swoobat}}. Her {{p|Unfezant}}, being the evolved form of Tranquill, will easily outclass Ash\'s Tranquill. With two of them out of the way, only Pikachu has a fighting chance. Ash tries to voice his opinions, but Skyla stops him and tells him to come back to the [[Mistralton Gym|Gym]] the next day at noon.\n\nLater that night at the [[Pokémon Center]], Ash plans his strategy to take down Skyla. Ash tells {{an|Iris}} and {{an|Cilan}} that he had decided to use Tranquill, Krokorok, and Pikachu on a whim, but he decides that the will of his {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} will help him prevail. The next day, Ash, Iris, and Cilan return to the Gym where a large crowd has gathered to finally see a real Gym battle. Cilan hopes that Ash will win and change Skyla\'s heart so that Cilan\'s battle the [[BW067|previous day]] wasn\'t for nothing. As Miles introduces Ash and Skyla, Ash ascends from underground on a platform to the field. On the opposite side, a large cannon comes out and fires Skyla high into the sky. After a flashy display of gliding through hoops tied to balloons with her glider pack, Skyla lands on the field ready to begin the match. Miles declares that the Gym Battle will be 3-on-3 and promptly begins the match.\n\nAsh sends out Krokorok first as Skyla sends out her Swoobat. Krokorok starts off by using {{m|Crunch}}, however Swoobat dodges and retaliates with {{m|Air Cutter}}. Krokorok quickly uses {{m|Dig}} to dodge the attack to stay underground, out of Swoobat\'s reach. Swoobat flies low trying to predict where Krokorok will appear. Krokorok jumps from out of the ground and unleashes {{m|Stone Edge}}. Swoobat reflects it back at Krokorok it with {{m|Gust}} but one manages to hit Swoobat while all of the others repelled by Gust are dodged by Krokorok. Swoobat recovers from its damage and fires off an Air Cutter attack, which throws Krokorok into the ground, knocking it out.\n\nTranquill is sent out to replace Krokorok. Tranquill starts off with an Air Cutter, but Swoobat counters with its own Air Cutter. Tranquill then uses Gust only to be stopped by Swoobat\'s own Gust. Skyla tells Swoobat to fly up high, but Tranquill chases it. Tranquill attacks with {{m|Wing Attack}} which Swoobat manages to dodge, but she follows up with Air Cutter which hits Swoobat and sends it to the ground, putting it out of the battle.\n\nAsh asks Skyla if she has changed her mind yet, but Skyla replies that Swoobat was already at a disadvantage from its battle with Krokorok, and that the battle is going exactly as she had planned. Skyla decides to call out her Unfezant, which puts Tranquill at a disadvantage due to its higher form. Tranquill starts off with a {{m|Quick Attack}}, but Unfezant dodges and then starts to fly downward with Tranquill following, then suddenly ascends causing Tranquill to stop her attacks. Unfezant fires off an {{m|Air Slash}} but Tranquill manages to dodge all of the attacks, but is heavily fatigued. \n\nAsh decides to recall her back for now, and Pikachu steps into the field to challenge Unfezant. With the advantage of Pikachu\'s {{t|Electric}} type over Flying types, Pikachu starts off with an {{m|Electro Ball}} but Unfezant quickly flies up to dodge. Unfezant retaliates with an Air Slash, which manages to hit Pikachu. Unfezant starts to use {{m|Aerial Ace}}. Ash tells Pikachu to ready an {{m|Iron Tail}} and wait until Unfezant gets close. Right as Unfezant is about to hit Pikachu, Pikachu attacks Unfezant with his prepared Iron Tail then hits Unfezant with an Electro Ball, causing Unfezant to faint.\n\nWith the advantage now on Ash\'s side, he asks Skyla what she thinks now. Skyla, still says things are going the way she had thought, since she knew Ash would rely on Pikachu heavily in the battle. Skyla calls out Swanna. Pikachu attacks with {{m|Thunderbolt}} but Swanna activates an {{m|Aqua Ring}} which neutralizes Thunderbolt. Pikachu tries to attack with Electro Ball, but Aqua Ring once again blocks it. Skyla reveals that she watched videos of Miles back when he was the [[Gym Leader]] and learned of this strategy to help fight off Swanna\'s glaring weakness to Electric attacks. With no possibility that Pikachu can utilize his electricity, Pikachu attacks with Iron Tail, but Swanna flies up high and dodges. As Ash notices the rings, which Skyla flew through during her decent to the field, he tells Pikachu to use Quick Attack. Pikachu uses the rings to help it reach Swanna and Quick Attack barely manages to hit Swanna. Swanna attacks back with {{m|Bubble Beam}} which knocks Pikachu off of the rings then continues to attack with {{m|Hurricane}}. Hurricane throws Pikachu into the air and Swanna attacks with {{m|Brave Bird}}. Pikachu crashes into the ground. Skyla expects that Pikachu is finished, but Pikachu stands up. However, the damage is too much for Pikachu and Ash decides that Pikachu shouldn\'t push himself anymore. Miles declares Pikachu unable to battle.\n\nAsh sends Tranquill back out and Tranquill starts off with a Quick Attack, which clips Swanna. Tranquill unleashes an Air Cutter attack which Swanna dodges until one manages to score a clean hit on it. Tranquill quickly rushes back down to the ground and attacks with Gust, but Swanna counters and overpowers Gust with a Hurricane. Hurricane swallows Tranquill and throws her onto the ground, injuring her. However, Tranquill begins to glow as she stands back up, Tranquill evolves into {{AP|Unfezant}}. With her new form and her new found vigor, Unfezant attacks with Air Cutter but Swanna flies up to dodge. Unfezant chases after it, but Swanna quickly turns and attacks with Brave Bird, hitting Unfezant. Swanna tries to attack once more but Unfezant flies faster than Swanna, allowing it to escape the attack. Swanna begins to tail Unfezant throughout the Gym but is unable to hit her. Unfezant snaps behind Swanna and uses her new move, Aerial Ace. Swanna and Unfezant fly around in circles trying to hit one another with no avail. Unfezant finally manages lock onto Swanna and attacks it with Aerial Ace, causing an explosion. As the smoke clears, Swanna falls down to the field, knocking it out, allowing Ash to win the match.\n\nAfter the battle, Skyla announces that she will no longer use Air Battles, realizing that the efforts of both the Trainer and their Pokémon can bring unpredictable results. She apologizes to Miles, but Miles is happy that Skyla has realized the error of her ways and looks forward to her new start, battling the way Gym Battles were meant to be. Without further delay, Skyla thanks Ash for the great battle and awards him with the {{Badge|Jet}}. Skyla, after asking Ash where he plans on heading out to next, suggests that he should head out to [[Icirrus City]].\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:Ash Jet Badge.png|thumb|220px|Ash holding the Jet Badge]]\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
