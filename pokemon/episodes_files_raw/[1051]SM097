Sleeping {{tt|Mokuroh|Rowlet}} zzz\'\') is the 97th episode of the {{series|Sun & Moon}}, and the 1,036th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on November 18, 2018 and in the United States on March 27, 2019.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/22_05-no-stone-unturned/-->\n<i>Hau and his partner Dartrix are training hard for the island challenge when they have a run-in with Ash and Rowlet. When Ash learns that Hau’s grandfather is Kahuna Hala, he challenges his new friend to a battle!\n\nDartrix wins easily, but Rowlet is fired up, and at a suggestion from Professor Burnet, Ash decides to teach it a new move. Returning to the woods where they first met, they encounter Trumbeak and Toucannon, who try to teach Rowlet to use Bullet Seed. That isn’t a move Rowlet can learn, but with determination, it does master Seed Bomb (after swallowing an Everstone)—and in the rematch, Rowlet emerges victorious!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Hau]] runs through a [[Melemele Island]] forest as his {{p|Dartrix}} practices its {{m|Razor Leaf}}. Just as Hau declares his intent to challenge [[Hala|his grandfather]], Dartrix senses something and fires a Razor Leaf into a nearby shrub. Hau checks the location and finds {{Ash}}, {{AP|Pikachu}}, and {{Rotom}} pinned to a tree trunk. As Ash greets him, Hau quickly notices Ash\'s [[Z-Ring]] and asks if he competed in Hala\'s [[Island challenge|grand trial]].\n\nAsh and Hau sit down to talk further, and Ash learns that Hau is Hala\'s grandson. Due to Hau\'s current experience, Hala has refused to battle him. Hau adds that he and his father recently returned to [[Alola]] after a long time away from the [[region]]. He explains that he is training close to the trial site, while Ash says he and Pikachu were just exploring Melemele when they stopped after seeing Dartrix\'s impressive skills. As Ash asks whether Dartrix is the evolved form of {{p|Rowlet}}, Rotom interjects and recites its data on Dartrix. Ash holds up [[Bag|his backpack]] and introduces Hau and Dartrix to his still-sleeping {{AP|Rowlet}}. Dartrix is immediately alarmed by Rowlet\'s bed hair and begins grooming it, but quickly becomes exhausted. Hau is amazed that Rowlet actually defeated Hala\'s {{p|Crabrawler}}, while his Dartrix was unable to. Soon enough, Hau and his Dartrix eagerly accept Ash\'s challenge to a battle.\n\nBefore the match begins, Rowlet and Dartrix exchange intense stares, and Rotom takes its position as the battle\'s [[Battle judge|referee]]. Hau makes the first [[move]], but Rowlet falls asleep mid-battle and dodges Dartrix\'s {{m|Leaf Blade}}. After Ash wakes Rowlet up, it uses Razor Leaf, but Dartrix\'s own Razor Leaf slices its way through; Rowlet manages to dodge it. As Dartrix prepares to use Leaf Blade, Ash attempts to place his [[Grassium Z]] onto his Z-Ring, but he accidentally drops it in the grass. As Ash frantically searches for it, Rowlet is defeated by Dartrix\'s attack. While Ash is disappointed, Rotom claims that Rowlet appeared to be unusually serious and more powerful in battle. Ash challenges Hau to a rematch after seeing Rowlet\'s increasing aggression, but Hau declines because he has an appointment with his father to attend. Instead, the two {{pkmn|Trainer}}s promise to meet up the next day for the rematch.\n\nOvernight, Ash tells {{an|Professor Kukui}} and [[Professor Burnet]] about Hau and Dartrix. Meanwhile, Rowlet continues to practice its techniques against a {{m|Substitute}} {{pkmn|doll}}. Burnet asks Ash if retaliating with a new move would be more exciting. Rotom searches its database as Burnet tells the story about Royal Mask\'s {{TP|Professor Kukui|Incineroar}} learning {{m|Cross Chop}} from {{m|Brick Break}}. Kukui interrupts the conversation and goes on to recite the Royal Mask\'s famous motto, "If you\'ve got doubts, go back to your roots." Burnet explains that it means to go back to the beginning and Kukui adds something like a place or important event to Rowlet may help. Ash thinks of an idea and announces that he and Rowlet will practice a new move the next day.\n\nThe following day, Ash escorts Rowlet to the location where they first met. Rotom is immediately concerned by Ash\'s logic, but Ash reassures it. Rowlet flies off and soon encounters {{DL|Toucannon\'s flock|Trumbeak}}. Ash follows Rowlet and Trumbeak as they fly over to {{DL|Toucannon\'s flock|Toucannon}}\'s nest. Toucannon greets Ash, and soon, it and Trumbeak fly down and begin eating rocks on the ground. The odd behavior perplexes Ash and Pikachu, but Rotom explains that this trait is common amongst Bird Pokémon and that it helps them digest their food properly. Then, to everyone\'s surprise, Trumbeak and Toucannon showcase their {{m|Bullet Seed}} attacks. The pair starts teaching Rowlet the attack, but Rowlet\'s species cannot learn the move and thus it is unable to perform it, despite Ash\'s reassurances.\n\nAsh joins the practice session. He stuffs his mouth full of round fruit and to everyone\'s surprise, Ash performs his own Bullet Seed, skillfully hitting the target. Ash explains that the trick to a successful Bullet Seed is focusing the energy in your stomach and keeping your eyes on the target. Rowlet is greatly encouraged and goes to look for the perfect stone. It soon finds a particularly round rock, but Rotom is alarmed and reveals that Rowlet just swallowed an [[Everstone]], an item that prevents [[evolution]]. Ash is shocked and tries to get Rowlet to spit the item out. Rotom then suggests that Rowlet tries another Bullet Seed. Rotom suggestion works, and the Everstone lands at Ash\'s feet. As Ash holds up the Everstone, Rowlet swoops in and promptly swallows it again. Rowlet returns to practicing on the target, landing several successive hits with the Everstone and swallowing the rock on the rebound. Soon enough the practice pays off and Rowlet\'s technique has developed into a {{m|Seed Bomb}} attack.\n\nWith a new move now mastered, Ash rushes over to meet Hau for the promised rematch. Hau apologizes for having to leave, and the match begins. Rowlet showcases its new move, Seed Bomb, and lands a hit on Dartrix. Hau is left amazed but confused by Ash\'s odd Seed Bomb technique. Rowlet soon strikes Dartrix with its {{m|Peck}} attack. Dartrix knocks Rowlet to the ground with Razor Leaf and follows up with a Leaf Blade. Dartrix pins Rowlet to a tree trunk with several blade quills. In desperation, Ash has Rowlet use Seed Bomb, but Dartrix knocks the attack away with its Leaf Blade. Just as Dartrix goes in for a finishing Leaf Blade, Ash puts his Grassium Z into his Z-Ring and has Rowlet free itself from the Razor Leaves with its surge in power. Rowlet unleashes {{m|Bloom Doom}} and Dartrix is defeated.\n\nHau tears up at his loss, but soon picks himself up. Rowlet and Dartrix thank each other as Ash and Hau agree to battle after Hau completes Hala\'s grand trial. Rowlet spots its Everstone on the ground and quickly swallows it before returning to sleep. Hau and Ash wave goodbye to each other as they walk in opposite directions.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
