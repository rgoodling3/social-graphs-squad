(Part 1)\'\'\' (Japanese: \'\'\'ポケモンレンジャー！デオキシス・クライシス！！ (前編)\'\'\' \'\'Pokémon Ranger! Deoxys Crisis!! (Part 1)\'\') is the 171st episode of the {{series|Advanced Generation}}, and the 445th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on April 13, 2006 and in the United States, first as an hour-long special on October 28, 2006.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/09_26-pokemon-ranger-deoxys-crisis-part-1/-->\n<i>Our heroes spot a confused flock of Pokémon and realize something isn\'t right, especially once an unusual aurora appears in the sky and their Poké Balls and PokéNav stop working! That\'s when they spot Solana, the Pokémon Ranger, who helps get the Pokémon going in the right direction. She explains that the Rangers have detected strange geomagnetic activity, and just then, the group sees a Deoxys in the sky! Could it be the source of the disturbance?\n\nWith Nurse Joy\'s help, Solana reasons that Deoxys may be connected to an old meteorite that crashed nearby. Solana goes to investigate alone—at least, that\'s what she thinks. Team Rocket wants Deoxys for the boss, and they secretly follow her to the meteorite cave. So does Max and the rest of the crew! Solana reluctantly lets Ash and company tag along. Inside the cave, she finds a Miltank and captures it because it may help them with Deoxys.\n\nOnce they find the meteorite, Deoxys emerges. It\'s in pain and is clearly hostile to them, but Solana can\'t capture it to calm it down unless it\'s in Normal Forme. She has Miltank use Heal Bell to soothe Deoxys\' pain, but it still won\'t be captured. Team Rocket reveal themselves, but Max and Meowth are getting strange impressions from Deoxys so both of them try to talk to it. Deoxys possesses Meowth and uses it to communicate with Max, but this backfires when Deoxys vanishes into a strange dimension and decides to take both Max and Meowth with it!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} continue on to {{an|May}}’s next {{pkmn|Contest}}. May is excited in that she needs one more [[Ribbon]] in order to get into the [[Kanto Grand Festival]]. {{an|Brock}} is excited that he gets to revisit [[Pewter City]], while Ash is preparing for the [[Battle Pyramid]]. They reach a cliff edge and look out to the mountain range. They notice the {{p|Swablu}} and {{p|Altaria}} flying off as an {{wp|Aurora (astronomy)|aurora}} suddenly appears, something [[Max]] knows is amiss. {{AP|Pikachu}} starts emitting electricity, not feeling well. The Swablu and Altaria flock fly blindly as Ash tries to bring out {{AP|Swellow}}, but its {{i|Poké Ball}} fails to deploy. None of May\'s or Brock\'s Balls work. Max pulls out the [[PokéNav]], which is also down. They notice [[Solana]] nearby as she tries to help the {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}.\n\nSolana uses her [[Capture Styler]] to capture an Altaria. It uses {{m|Refresh}} to help the other Swablu and Altaria, getting them to safety. Solana points out that {{wp|Earth\'s magnetic field|geomagnetic}} irregularities have been present, which explains the anomalies. The Capture Styler worked because it is sealed against {{wp|electromagnetism}}. Pikachu notices something as they spot a {{p|Deoxys}} emerging from a portal. Max locks eyes with Deoxys, experiencing a vision as it retreats into a portal. Solana leads the group to a nearby [[Pokémon Center]]. [[Nurse Joy]] mentions to Solana that the computer system is disabled to the point of not being able to boot up. The presence of Deoxys is suspected to be the cause as the events have been going on for a week. Solana mentions that it happened [[M07|before]] at [[LaRousse City]] where [[Professor Lund]] mentioned that it appeared via a [[Meteorite]]. Nurse Joy mentions that a meteorite crashed in the mountains ten years ago. They want to find the meteorite as Nurse Joy gets a map. Max wants to go with Solana to see Deoxys, but Solana declines since it is dangerous. Joy hands Solana the map as {{TRT}} overhears, wanting to get Deoxys for {{an|Giovanni|the Boss}}, thinking about another [[boss fantasy]]. Team Rocket follows Solana.\n\nSolana notices {{p|Plusle}} being affected by the geomagnetic disturbance as she approaches a cave. Solana notices Max following as Ash and his friends find Max. Solana lets them follow as Brock takes the geomagnetic scanner. The group heads into the cave as Team Rocket follows. Brock mentions the scanner’s status as Max pushes ahead. The geomagnetic disturbance suddenly disappears, the scanner pointing out all clear. However, Solana believes it is intermittent. Max gets impatient and presses ahead, noticing a {{p|Miltank}}. Solana uses the Styler to capture Miltank. The group finds the meteorite. Another disturbance fires up as Deoxys appears atop the meteorite.\n\nPikachu is severely affected the disturbance, same with Plusle, as Deoxys switches to [[List of Pokémon with form differences#Deoxys|Attack Forme]], firing {{m|Psycho Boost}}. Everyone dodges as Pikachu fires {{m|Thunderbolt}}, but Deoxys switches to [[List of Pokémon with form differences#Deoxys|Defense Forme]] to protect. Solana decides to use her Styler to capture Deoxys, but it must be in [[List of Pokémon with form differences#Deoxys|Normal Forme]]. Deoxys switches to Normal Forme and she makes her move, but it quickly changes to [[List of Pokémon with form differences#Deoxys|Speed Forme]] and dodges. Max hears Deoxys trying to talk as it switches to Normal. She tries again, but it switches to Defense and resists the Styler. Max looks into its eyes as it fires another Psycho Boost, everyone dodging. Team Rocket arrives and {{MTR}} points out that Deoxys in pain. Deoxys flies around as Solana\'s Styler points out Deoxys is in pain, but from an unknown reason.\n\nSolana has Miltank use {{m|Heal Bell}} to help Deoxys, the Pokémon switching to Normal Forme. The geomagnetic disturbance level goes down as she attempts another capture, but Deoxys switches to Defense form to resist, trying to speak again. It attacks with Psycho Boost, sending everyone flying. Miltank runs off as Team Rocket shows up and recite their {{motto}}. Deoxys appears behind them and sends everyone but Meowth running. Meowth tries to talk to Deoxys as Max climbs up onto the meteorite to Deoxys. Meowth can\'t understand Deoxys as it emits a {{m|Safeguard}} around the meteorite and the three. Deoxys takes over Meowth and uses it as a translator, mentioning that it is scared. Max tries to probe Deoxys as he plans to listen. An image of a meteorite appears in Max’s mind as Deoxys mentions how cold and scared it was during the space flight. Deoxys takes Meowth and Max through the portal, disappearing into {{wp|Parallel universe (fiction)|another dimension}}.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} meet up with {{OBP|Pokémon Ranger|Ranger series}} [[Solana]] again and encounter the [[Mythical Pokémon]] {{p|Deoxys}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Deoxys}} (Speed Forme)\n\n=====TV episode debuts=====\n* {{p|Deoxys}} (All Formes)\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:Deoxys Crisis DVD.jpg|thumb|220px|Japanese DVD art]]\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* {{an|Giovanni}} ([[Boss fantasy|fantasy]])\n* [[Solana]]\n* [[Pokémon Center]] employee\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Mime Jr.}} ({{OP|James|Mime Jr.}})\n* {{p|Sceptile}} ({{OP|Ash|Sceptile}})\n* {{p|Swellow}} ({{OP|Ash|Swellow}})\n* {{p|Combusken}} ({{OP|May|Combusken}})\n* {{p|Marshtomp}} ({{OP|Brock|Marshtomp}})\n* {{p|Plusle}} ([[Solana]]\'s)\n* {{p|Deoxys}} ({{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Deoxys|anime}})\n* {{p|Miltank}}\n* {{p|Swablu}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Altaria}} (multiple)\n\n==Trivia==\n* In some areas of Japan, this episode and [[AG172|the following one]] were broadcast separately, instead of together as a one-hour special. As a result, the opening changes from \'\'[[AG173|All That Glitters is Not Golden!]]\'\' debuted in \'\'Part 2\'\' instead. The English dub also originally broadcast this as a special, but it is considered two separate episodes.\n* Beginning with this episode, the {{pkmn|anime}} is directed by 須藤典彦 \'\'Norihiko Sudō\'\', who replaces 日高政光 \'\'Masamitsu Hidaka\'\'.\n* In Japan and {{pmin|the United States}}, this episode was aired as a special to coincide with the release of {{ga|Pokémon Ranger}}. As a result, it aired out of Japanese order in the United States, as did the later Pokémon Ranger specials.\n* Pokémon Ranger\'s two sequels, {{g|Ranger: Shadows of Almia}} and {{g|Ranger: Guardian Signs}}, also got anime specials in the form of \'\'[[DP071|Pokémon Ranger and the Kidnapped Riolu! Parts One]] [[DP072|and Two]]\'\', and \'\'[[DP169|Pokémon Ranger: Heatran Rescue!]]\'\'.\n* This episode was based on a [[Ranger Net]] mission called \'\'Gain Deoxys\'s Trust?!\'\'. Similar to that mission, Deoxys can only be captured in its Normal Forme.\n* Although most, if not all, genderless Pokémon are referred to as male in the Latin American dub, the episode calls Deoxys a female Pokémon, with the use of "{{tt|ella|she}}" by most of the characters.\n* Deoxys in these two episodes speaks through {{MTR}} via telepathy, much like the giant {{p|Tentacruel}} in \'\'[[EP019|Tentacool & Tentacruel]]\'\'.\n* This episode references \'\'[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]\'\'; Solana uses [[Professor Lund]]\'s research for her mission.\n* {{TRT}} doesn\'t blast off in this episode.\n* This episode marks the first animated appearance of {{p|Deoxys}}\'s Speed Forme, due to {{game|Emerald}} being released after \'\'[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]\'\'.\n\n===Errors===\n* {{Ash}} could hear Meowth when he was inside {{m|Safeguard}}. However, in \'\'[[AG146|Fear Factor Phony]]\'\', when {{p|Abra}} was using Safeguard, it could be not heard from the outside.\n* When Deoxys flies around after using {{m|Psycho Boost}}, it was shown to be in Defense Forme, but was in Attack Forme when it attacked, without visibly changing.\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=77FF77|bordercolor=55DD55\n|zh_cmn={{tt|神奇寶貝保育家！代歐奇希斯危機！！(前篇)|Pokémon Ranger!
