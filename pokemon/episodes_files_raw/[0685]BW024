It first aired in Japan on March 24, 2011 and first aired in the United States on July 16, 2011.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/14_24-emolga-the-irresistible/-->\n<i>Bianca has rejoined Ash and the gang as they leave Castelia City for the Nimbasa Gym. Along the way, they meet an Emolga, and Bianca is instantly smitten with the super-cute Pokémon! Vowing to catch Emolga at all costs, Bianca attempts to battle it using her Minccino. But Emolga gets away, and Bianca takes off in pursuit, along with Ash and Cilan.\n\nMeanwhile, Iris and Axew have taken off separately to track down Emolga—and end up tumbling down a steep hill into a Swoobat nest! With Emolga’s help, they manage to escape, but the angry Swoobat chase them into a cave.\n\nStill determined to catch Emolga, Bianca is searching the forest, disturbing a powerful Scolipede and an angry Galvantula in the process. Finally, Cilan sees the electric evidence of Emolga’s Discharge attack, and leads Ash and Bianca to the cave where the Swoobat cornered Iris and Axew! Ash and Pikachu manage to drive off the Swoobat, and our heroes are reunited!\n\nAs Cilan prepares a celebratory feast, Emolga approaches the group again, apparently willing to be caught this time...but much to Bianca’s dismay, the adorable Pokémon seems to want Iris for its Trainer instead. And so the journey continues, with Emolga as Iris’s newest friend!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nA trio of {{p|Patrat}} are getting some apples from a tree and manage to collect a lot of them. Nearby, an {{TP|Iris|Emolga}} watches. She pretends to be exhausted and uses {{m|Attract}} to swindle the Patrat of their apples. Later, {{Ash}}, {{an|Iris}}, {{an|Cilan}}, and {{an|Bianca}}, who is revealed to be traveling with the group on their journey to [[Nimbasa City]], are just finishing lunch as Iris brings in some apples for the group for dessert. Bianca complains that apples aren\'t true dessert, saying that chocolate is. Suddenly, [[Ash\'s Oshawott]] pops out of his {{i|Poké Ball}} and eats an apple and becomes happy. Iris throws an apple for Axew to catch. Suddenly, {{TP|Iris|Axew}}\'s apple rolls down a hill as he goes after it. The Emolga that stole apples from the Patrat sees Axew running down the hill, so she comes out and catches the apple. She is about to leave until she sees Iris\'s big plate of apples.\n\nEmolga begins thinking of a plan to get the group\'s apples, and gives Axew his apple back. Everything goes as planned for Emolga, as Iris thanks Emolga by giving her the plate of apples, but Bianca, out of nowhere, grabs Emolga and smothers her in hugs. Ash and Cilan, along with {{AP|Pikachu}} and {{AP|Oshawott}} follows behind, admiring Emolga\'s cuteness. Deciding that she wants to catch it, Bianca sends out {{TP|Bianca|Minccino}} to battle Emolga. As Emolga fires {{m|Attract}} at Minccino, but Minccino counters by using an Attract attack of his own. However, Emolga\'s wins out, and just before it hits Minccino, [[Ash\'s Oshawott]] takes the hit, and becomes attracted with Emolga, much to Ash\'s frustration, so he recalls Oshawott to his Poké Ball. \n\nEmolga then flees as Bianca, Iris, and Axew go after it, with Ash, Cilan and Pikachu following. Emolga stops on a tree branch and sees more fruit growing on the tree. Emolga remembers a sinister Bianca and Minccino, as she angrily grabs two apples and chows them down. Iris and Axew catch up to Emolga, and Axew offers his apple to Emolga. Iris claims that Axew has a little crush on Emolga, and Axew starts dancing. The Sky Squirrel Pokémon decides to use the same plan as before with Axew, but Bianca appears on the scene again. After a brief battle with Bianca\'s Minccino once again, Emolga flees into [[tall grass]], with Axew and Iris in pursuit. Ash and Cilan catch up, and Ash suggests that Bianca should give up, but she refuses, so the trio continue to search.\n\nMeanwhile, as Iris and Axew finally spot Emolga, Axew and Emolga start sliding down a hillside, and Iris goes after them and catches them in her arms. Unfortunately, the rock they\'re on breaks from the main hill, and they slide into the forest. There, they stumble upon a {{p|Swoobat}}\'s nest. After Emolga fights off the Swoobat, they rest at a nearby lake. Emolga decides to play a little game in the water by throwing {{m|Hidden Power}} orbs into the water, creating ripples. However, she accidentally makes one way too strong, creating a big wave in the lake that splashes a nearby Swoobat. So the whole nest of Swoobat begin to chase the trio again, but they escape. Meanwhile, Ash, Cilan and Bianca go down the hill, after Iris and Emolga. As they continue their search, they get attacked by a {{p|Scolipede}} and a {{p|Galvantula}} because Bianca misinterprets their rustling in a trees and a bush to be Emolga.\n\nMeanwhile, Iris, along with Axew and Emolga, hide behind a rock from the Swoobat until they use {{m|Round}} to expose them. Surrounded, Iris desperately calls out {{TP|Iris|Excadrill}} for help, but as usual, Excadrill ignores Iris. Emolga then uses Attract on the Swoobat (and Excadrill by accident), but the female Swoobat are unaffected. Ash, Cilan, and Bianca then arrive on the scene as they combat the Swoobat. Ash\'s Pikachu uses {{m|Thunderbolt}}, but there are still more Swoobat. Suddenly, Oshawott appears again and prepares to defend Emolga. However, he is quickly defeated by a powerful {{m|Charge Beam}} and recalled. So Pikachu and Emolga use a Thunderbolt-{{m|Hidden Power}} combo to defeat the remaining Swoobat. Bianca, impressed by Emolga\'s strength, still wants to catch her, but decides to give up so she won\'t get shocked again.\n\nBack at their picnic table, Cilan decides to make a "special dinner" for the group, consisting of apples. Suddenly, Emolga appears and jumps into Iris\'s arms. Ash says that Emolga likes her so Iris decides to catch her.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:Iris catches a Pokémon.png|thumb|220px|Iris after catching Emolga]]\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
