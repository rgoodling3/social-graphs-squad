It first aired in Japan on September 13, 2012, in the United Kingdom on December 28, 2012, and in the United States on January 5, 2013.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/15_46-the-road-to-humilau/-->\n<i>Our heroes’ new acquaintance Cameron is off to the Humilau Gym to win his eighth Gym badge, and Ash, Cilan, and Iris have decided to tag along! On the way, Ash and Cameron discover they have a lot in common and start chatting away, so when they take a wrong turn and get separated from Iris and Cilan, they don’t notice until their friends are well out of sight. To make matters worse, it starts to rain—hard! The boys seek shelter in a cave, and after Meloetta finds them some fruit for dinner, they decide to take a nap.\n\nMeloetta wakes them when the rain stops, and after some false starts, Cameron follows his nose to the ocean to find Humilau City. They’re not quite sure where the Gym is, though—at least until Gym Leader Marlon surfaces in front of them, riding his enormous Wailord! Marlon gives them a lift to his unusual Gym, built right into the water, where they reunite with Iris and Cilan.\n\nIt’s time for Cameron’s Gym battle! His Ferrothorn quickly defeats Marlon’s Jellicent with a supereffective Thunderbolt, but something seems strange—and when Cameron tries to use Thunderbolt against Marlon’s Mantine, he discovers what happened: Jellicent’s Ability, Cursed Body, disabled the move! Without Thunderbolt, Ferrothorn loses in short order, and Cameron decides he needs a Pokémon better suited to the Gym’s aquatic battlefield. He sends out his Samurott, and the battle moves underwater. The spectators can’t see what’s going on below the surface as the two Pokémon trade attacks. But when they come up again, it’s clear Samurott has managed to get the upper hand. It knocks Mantine out with a powerful double Razor Shell, and Cameron wins the Wave Badge!\n\nWith eight Gym badges each, Ash and Cameron are both ready to enter the Unova League. They part ways for now, but promise to see each other there, as the journey continues!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nWhile they are walking to [[Humilau City]], {{Ash}} and {{un|Cameron}} talk about the [[Unova League]]. {{an|Cilan}} remarks that the two get on really well, which {{an|Iris}} says is because they are both little kids. But when they look around, Ash and Cameron are gone, and Cilan thinks they took a wrong turn. Meanwhile, Ash and Cameron are walking in the completely wrong direction. Suddenly, {{an|Meloetta}} flies past and materializes in front of Ash and Cameron. After introducing himself, Cameron realizes Cilan and Iris are gone. Ash and Cameron start to look when Ash falls off a cliff, but manages to grab some plants. Cameron comes over and manages to pull Ash up.\n\nAt this point, Ash and Cameron realize they are hopelessly lost. As they try to find their way back, it starts to rain. The two trainers manage to find a cave for shelter. The two are hungry and decide to eat, but both realize they forgot to pack any food with them. Meloetta floats off and finds an apple tree. The group collects the apples and gorge themselves in the cave. Waiting for the rain to stop, Ash and Cameron exchange their dreams. They both have similar goals. Ash wants to be a [[Pokémon Master]] while Cameron wants to be a [[Pokémon Champion]].\n\nEventually the rain stops and the sky clears, allowing Cameron to use the stars to navigate. As they are walking, Cameron walks off a cliff similar to the way Ash did but grabs a root to stop him from falling. Roles reversed, it is now up to Ash to save Cameron. Ash can\'t pull up Cameron and starts to get dragged down. Cameron tells Ash to let go, but Ash will not. Ash starts to fall when Riolu and {{AP|Pikachu}} grab him and pull the two up.\n\nFinally, the two trainers see the ocean in the distance and run toward it, ready for Cameron\'s upcoming [[Gym]] battle. They get to the city and are looking for the Gym when a {{p|Wailord}} with a man on its back surfaces in front of them. At the [[Humilau Gym]], Iris and Cilan are waiting for Cameron and Ash to arrive when {{TP|Iris|Axew}} sees them in the distance riding the Wailord. The man on the Wailord\'s back introduces himself as [[Marlon]], the city\'s [[Gym Leader]].\n\nThe battle is on a water battlefield with floating platforms. Cameron and Marlon agree to a 2-on-2 battle. Confident, Cameron calls on Riolu to battle, but Riolu is back at the dock. Snapping his headband to regain his focus, Cameron is ready to battle. Marlon sends out his {{p|Jellicent}} and Cameron sends out his {{p|Ferrothorn}}. Ferrothorn looks to be at a disadvantage though because it is having a hard time balancing on the stage\'s floating platforms. Cameron attacks first with {{m|Pin Missile}}, but Jellicent dives underwater, but quickly comes up to attack with {{m|Shadow Ball}} that Ferrothorn dodges. Ash and Iris are impressed with Cameron\'s battling abilities. Ferrothorn unleashes a super-effective {{m|Thunderbolt}} that manages to hit Jellicent. Jellicent [[fainting|faints]], but his {{a|Cursed Body}} Ability disables Ferrothorn\'s Thunderbolt.\n\nNext, Marlon calls out his {{p|Mantine}}. Knowing {{type|Electric}}s are super-effective against {{t|Water}}- and {{type|Flying}}s like Mantine, Cameron calls for another Thunderbolt, but it doesn\'t work because Jellicent\'s Cursed Body Ability has disabled the attack. Ash and {{ashfr}} are worried that Cameron won\'t be able to win this battle. Cameron has Ferrothorn use Pin Missile instead, but Mantine uses {{m|Wing Attack}} followed by {{m|Bullet Seed}} before Ferrothorn is able to attack. A final {{m|Psybeam}} knocks Ferrothorn out.\n\nFor his next Pokémon, Cameron calls out his {{p|Samurott}}. Mantine uses Bullet Seed, but Samurott dives underwater to dodge. Marlon has Mantine follow and the battle shifts to an underwater battle. Mantine uses Bullet Seed again, but Samurott evades the attack and uses {{m|Hydro Cannon}} from behind. Dazed, Mantine is unable to dodge Samurott\'s {{m|Aqua Jet}}, launching both Pokémon out of the water. Mantine tries Bullet Seed for a third time, but Cameron has Samurott deflect the attack with {{m|Razor Shell}}. Mantine swoops down with {{m|Wing Attack}}, but Samurott meets the aerial attack with a double Razor Shell, knocking out Mantine and winning Cameron the battle. Marlon presents Cameron with the {{Badge|Wave}}, giving Cameron the eight Badges he needs to compete in the Unova League.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
