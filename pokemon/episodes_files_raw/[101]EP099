Ice Battle!!\'\') is the 99th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on June 3, 1999 and in the United States on April 15, 2000. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/02_46-the-mandarin-island-miss-match/-->\n<i>Ash, Misty and Tracey are on Mandarin Island where Ash has just won three battles in a row. But, he finally meets his match when they run into, Prima, one of the very best trainers on the Orange Islands. Misty is thrilled to meet her hero because she also trains water-type Pokémon, but, it\'s Ash who learns a very valuable lesson from this trainer who also sets him on course for a chance at another Orange League badge!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nOn [[Mandarin Island South|Mandarin Island]], {{Ash}} finishes off a {{p|Butterfree}} with {{AP|Bulbasaur}}\'s {{m|Razor Leaf}}. Later on, as Ash and {{an|Misty}} eat, {{Tracey}} tells them that [[Lorelei|Prima]] is going to give a lecture on the island. Misty is ecstatic, and tells Ash and Tracey that Prima is her hero. She hears a voice behind her, and turns to see Prima herself. Misty and Tracey introduce themselves while Ash chokes on his sandwich. She walks past them, however, and bends down to look at {{TP|Misty|Togepi}}.\n\nNearby, {{MTR}} watches from the bushes while [[Jessie]] and [[James]] eat. James sees Prima and recognizes her, but cannot ascertain her name. Prima then looks out at the ocean, and makes many philosophical comments about nature. Ash asks for a {{pkmn|battle}}, but Prima ignores him. Ash arrogantly interprets this as an admission that she is afraid to battle and goes off in search of someone else.\n\nAsh eventually does find an opponent who accepts his challenge. As Prima watches, Ash offers to let the boy set up the rules and they agree on two {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} each. Ash sends out {{AP|Squirtle}}, and the boy releases a {{p|Persian}}. Squirtle uses {{m|Water Gun}}, but Persian dodges it. It uses {{m|Thunderbolt}}, but Squirtle uses {{m|Withdraw}}. It then pops out of its shell and {{m|Skull Bash}}es Persian, knocking it out. The boy then sends out a {{p|Tauros}}, who {{m|Tackle}}s Squirtle right away, knocking it out. Ash withdraws Squirtle and sends out {{AP|Charizard}}, but Ash still cannot control Charizard and it burns him.\n\nPrima continues to watch as Tauros uses {{m|Take Down}}. Charizard then uses {{m|Flamethrower}}, knocking out Tauros in one hit. He then {{m|Fly|flies}} into the air and attempts to burn everything in sight. Ash tries to call it back, but the [[recall]] beam from the {{i|Poké Ball}} misses. When Ash gets burnt by Flamethrower again, Prima intervenes, sending out her {{p|Slowbro}}, who uses {{m|Disable}}, immobilizing Charizard in midair. It then brings it down to the ground, and Ash succeeds in calling it back. Prima asks Ash if he knows what he is doing, and he defends himself by saying that he was in the top sixteen in the [[Indigo Plateau Conference]]. Unimpressed, Prima asks the trio to come to her demonstration later, and they enthusiastically accept.\n\nLater, Ash and {{ashfr}} watch Prima battle from the stands of Mandarin Island Stadium. Team Rocket also sneaks in, dressed as food vendors. James now fully recognizes Prima, and they plan to steal her Pokémon. The demonstration goes on for a while and Prima defeats every Pokémon she goes up against. Ash watches intently, determined to try and pick up some tips. After the demonstration, Prima invites Ash and his friends to her house for some tea. There, Ash announces his suspicions that Prima is trying to teach him reverse psychology. Prima tells them that every person has a particular way of acting in and out of battle. She then explains that she is like the water, usually going with the flow, but when she is in battle, she becomes as cold as ice. She walks outside, and tells Ash that the most important thing is knowing where his strength lies. She then insists that Ash may be strong in some ways, but he needs to develop what comes from the inside.\n\nAsh then challenges Prima to a battle once again, which she accepts. They agree on one Pokémon each, and send out their Pokémon. Ash uses Pikachu, and Prima chooses Cloyster. Pikachu uses Thunderbolt, but Cloyster Withdraws into its shell. Pikachu then uses {{m|Agility}}, but is knocked back by Cloyster\'s {{m|Reflect}}. Next Pikachu uses {{m|Thunder}}; it hits Cloyster, but it begins glowing red. Tracey warns Ash that this is {{m|Rage}}, which increases its Attack level. Pikachu tries a {{m|Quick Attack}}, but is defeated by {{m|Aurora Beam}} and Take Down.\n\nPrima calls back Cloyster, and looks at Pikachu to see if he is okay. She tells Ash that he has the skills he needs to be a Pokémon Master, but adds that he needs to remember that his Pokémon are the ones who win the [[Badge]]s. She then tells him that with his Pokémon and friends by his side, he will always succeed. She finally reveals that if he wins all of the Gym Badges in the [[Orange League]], he will be presented with an "Honorable Trainer" trophy.\n\nSuddenly, {{TRT}} arrives and ask Prima for a CD recording of her lecture. She replies that it is on tape only, and whispers to Ash and his friends that it is $18.95, shocking Team Rocket before they say their {{motto}}. Misty correctly guesses that their original plan was to steal Prima\'s Pokémon, but they tell her that they decided to go after Pikachu, figuring they would lose against Prima. Ash gets ready to fight, but Prima tells him that she will take care of it. She immediately sends out {{p|Jynx}}, who uses {{m|Ice Punch}} and freezes Team Rocket. Jynx then uses {{m|Blizzard}} and blows them into the sky. The pieces from the ice block rain down, making sparkles in the sky.\n\nThat evening, Prima tells Ash that the nearest [[Trovita Gym|Gym]] is on [[Trovita Island]], which is straight across the bay on the other side of Mandarin Island. Ash and his friends thank Prima before heading off.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

Also, a {{p|Machamp}} says "{{p|Machop}}".\n* When Jessie says "Prepare for trouble, and defeat", the split in her shirt goes past the "R" and to her collar.\n* When Jynx uses {{m|Ice Punch}}, Prima incorrectly orders her to use {{m|Ice Beam}} in the dub.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[Pikachu\'s Jukebox]]: {{OBP|Viridian City|song}}\n* In the dub, Lorelei is incorrectly referred to as \'\'\'Prima\'\'\'. [[4Kids Entertainment]] has claimed that this is due to "Lorelei" having an extra syllable over her Japanese name, "Kanna", although it is also possible that the writers did not know that she already had an English name.\n* All of the references to Prima\'s status as a member of the Elite Four are removed from the dub.\n** This would later create a minor contradiction when {{an|Misty}} mentions this encounter with Prima in \'\'[[EP140|Wired for Battle!]]\'\' and refers to her as an Elite Four member.\n* A 38-second scene, after Ash suggests that Prima is only denying him a battle because she will lose, was cut in some versions of the English dub as well as in all international dubs based on it. It is cut in all [[List of English language Adventures in the Orange Islands home video releases (Region 1)|U.S. DVD releases]], but not on two older [[List of English language Adventures in the Orange Islands home video releases (Region 4)|Australian DVD releases]], and was previously broadcast on [[Kids WB]] and [[Cartoon Network]]. In the dub version where it is not cut out, the segment is zoomed in. This is likely due to the scene focusing on Prima\'s cleavage. The dialogue is as it follows:\n::\'\'\'Ash:\'\'\' Hey, what\'s so funny? Not only am I an undefeated Champion on this island, but I\'m practically a Pokémon Master! C\'mon, Prima, one battle?\n::\'\'\'Misty:\'\'\' The only thing you\'re the Master of is disaster!\n::\'\'\'Ash:\'\'\' Who asked you? Maybe you want me to teach you a lesson instead of Prima. Hey, I guess I could use another easy win.\n::\'\'\'Misty:\'\'\' What do you mean, \'another easy win?\'\n::\'\'\'Ash \'\'(walking away)\'\':\'\'\' Oh well, if the great Prima\'s scared of me, I guess I\'ll find somebody who\'s not afraid to lose.\n::\'\'\'Misty \'\'(annoyed)\'\':\'\'\' Ugh... that Ash is so... If he ever did battle you, he\'d see he\'s not as great as he thinks he is!\n\n:In the original Japanese version, he challenges her to a {{pkmn|battle}}, but she smiles and does not take him seriously, making him blush in embarrassment and anger. Ash then says something inappropriate about Misty in front of Prima. This really angers Misty, she shouts at Ash, and he walks away to find another {{pkmn|Trainer}} to battle. In the versions with the cut, it is simply implied that he feels sorry for her because she didn\'t accept his challenge.\n\n<gallery>\nDeletedsceneEP099.png|The original Japanese scene, without the zoom added in the dubbed version\nZoomedinsceneEP099.png|Zoomed-in scene, from an Australian DVD\n</gallery>\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FFDDAA|bordercolor=FFBB55\n|zh_cmn={{tt|四天王科拿，冰之戰鬥|Lorelei of the Elite Four, Ice Battle}}\n|cs={{tt|Zápas na Mandarinkovém ostrově|A battle on Mandarin Island}}\n|nl={{tt|De Mandarin Island Miss Match|The Mandarin Island Miss Match}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Sirena sur l\'île Mandarine|Lorelei on Mandarin Island}}\n|de={{tt|Ash und die Lektion auf der Mandarininsel|Ash and the lesson on Mandarin island}}\n|he=תחרות באי מנדרינה {{tt|\'\'Takharut ba\'Ee Mandarina\'\'|Competition at Mandarina Island}}\n|hu={{tt|Ash csatája a Mandarin szigeten|Ash\'s Battle on the Mandarin Island}}\n|it={{tt|Lezioni di vita|Life lessons}}\n|ko=사천왕 칸나! 물과 얼음의 마음\n|no={{tt|Mandarinøyas overraskelse|The surprise of Mandarin Island}}\n|pl={{tt|Mistrzyni Wyspy Mandarynek|Mandarin Island Mistress}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Batalha Errada na Ilha Mandarin|Wrong Battle at the Mandarin Island}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|O Combate da Ilha Mandarin|The Battle at Mandarin Island}}\n|ro={{tt|Meciul de pe Insula Mandarin|The Match on the Mandarin Island}}\n|ru={{tt|Поражение на Мандариновом острове|Loss at the Mandarin Island}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Duelo en la isla Mandarín!|Duel at Mandarin island!}}\'\'\'\n|es_eu={{tt|Combate femenino de isla Mandarina|Mandarin island feminine combat}}\n|sv={{tt|Prima Pokémon|Prime Pokémon/Prima Pokémon}}\n}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP098 |\nprevtitle=A Way Off Day Off |\nnextcode=EP100 |\nnexttitle=Wherefore Art Thou, Pokémon? |\nseries=Original series |\nepisodelist=List of original series episodes |\ncolorscheme=Orange }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0099}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|099]]\n[[Category:Banned episodes]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Atsuhiro Tomioka]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded and directed by Yoshitaka Fujimoto]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Yoshitaka Fujimoto]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Yoshitaka Fujimoto]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Sato Yamamoto]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Ash]]\n[[Category:Episodes featuring Elite Four members]]\n\n[[de:Ash und die Lektion auf der Mandarin Insel]]\n[[es:EP101]]\n[[fr:EP099]]\n[[it:EP099]]\n[[ja:無印編第99話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第100集]]'}
