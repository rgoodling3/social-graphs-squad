They come across trees filled with a wide variety of [[Berry|Berries]]. Ash takes a bite out of a [[Tamato Berry]] and quickly discovers it to be extremely [[Flavor|spicy]].  They stop by a [[Pokémon Center]], where [[Nurse Joy]] is initially startled by Ash\'s swollen lips. While Nurse Joy checks out all of their Pokémon, Ash goes outside to continue working with {{AP|Snorunt}} to improve its {{m|Ice Beam}}. Outside, {{TRT}} is relaxing on the ground from their gardening job when a {{p|Munchlax}} steps on all of them. In anger, they give chase. Suddenly, [[Jessie]] stops at a nearby window when she sees a [[Berry Blender]] inside. Together they come up with a new plan. Meanwhile Snorunt continues launch its Ice Beam, but with extremely low accuracy. Ash accidentally gets hit by one of the rogue Ice Beam, but his wounds from the Tamato Berry are at least healed.\n\n{{an|Brock}}, {{an|May}}, and [[Max]] decide to make their own [[Pokéblock]]s after Nurse Joy gives them permission to use the Berries in the garden. May comes up with her own Berry recipe called "May\'s Purple Surprise" consisting of two [[Pecha Berry|Pecha Berries]], one [[Oran Berry]], one [[Bluk Berry]], and a small bit of Tamato Berry. The result is something that everyone, Pokémon and human alike, agrees is disgusting. However, the Munchlax that bothered Team Rocket wanders into the Pokémon Center, and turns out to be the one exception and loves May\'s Pokéblocks. Team Rocket then comes in [[List of Team Rocket\'s disguises|disguised as professional Pokéblock tasters]], scamming people by offering advice on creating the perfect Pokéblocks while {{MTR}} and {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} steal all the Pokéblocks and blenders. To everyone\'s surprise, [[Jessie]] likes May\'s Pokéblock too. Soon everyone realizes that they\'re Pokéblocks are gone, and blame Munchlax, claiming it ate them all. Team Rocket chime in to make sure Munchlax takes all the blame for the theft.\n\nAs they argue, Munchlax wanders off. Outside it finds more Berries, but gets cornered by the theft victims. Despite the lack of evidence, they still believe Munchlax is the thief. May and the group, including Nurse Joy, defend Munchlax since no one actually saw the Pokémon eat the blocks. May decides to catch it, and says that as its Trainer, she will take responsibility for disciplining it. She calls on {{TP|May|Combusken}} to battle it. Combusken tries to use {{m|Fire Spin}} and {{m|Sky Uppercut}}, but Munchlax ends up dodging the [[move]]s. After Munchlax takes a short nap, it\'s finally ready to battle. It dodges another attack after getting distracted by a nearby Berry. Back inside, Team Rocket continue making Pokéblocks to sell. [[James]] samples a Tamato Berry and runs outside screaming from the spice. He ends up running right next to where Ash and the others are. The bag he\'s carrying has a hole in it, and when Pokéblocks fall out, everyone realizes who the real thieves are. Just then Jessie sneaks up from behind and grabs {{AP|Pikachu}} in a net.\n\nJessie, James, and Meowth take off with Pikachu in their hot air balloon, but with one Fire Spin from Combusken, Pikachu is set free. Then Ash has Snorunt use Ice Beam, but its accuracy is still poor and it hits a nearby tree, freezing it solid. Just when Team Rocket think they\'re going to make a clean getaway, one of the frozen tips of the tree slices through their balloon and it explodes, sending them blasting off. All of the stolen Pokéblocks begin falling through the sky, and Munchlax quickly runs around eating them all. May takes the opportunity to try to catch it, but Munchlax also swallows the {{i|Poké Ball}}. To everyone\'s surprise, the Poké Ball is activated inside {{TP|May|Munchlax}}\'s mouth, and it is {{pkmn2|caught}}. With that, their journey continues to the [[Grand Festival]] in Slateport City.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:May catching Munchlax.png|thumb|220px|Munchlax getting caught]]\n* {{an|May}} catches a {{TP|May|Munchlax}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n=====TV episode debuts=====\n* {{p|Munchlax}} ({{OP|May|Munchlax}})\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* Children\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:PTC AG117.png|thumb|200px|right|Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]\n[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]: {{p|Bagon}}\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Swellow}} ({{OP|Ash|Swellow}})\n* {{p|Grovyle}} ({{OP|Ash|Grovyle}})\n* {{p|Corphish}} ({{OP|Ash|Corphish}})\n* {{p|Torkoal}} ({{OP|Ash|Torkoal}})\n* {{p|Snorunt}} ({{OP|Ash|Snorunt}})\n* {{p|Combusken}} ({{OP|May|Combusken}})\n* {{p|Munchlax}} ({{OP|May|Munchlax}}; new)\n* {{p|Forretress}} ({{OP|Brock|Forretress}})\n* {{p|Ludicolo}} ({{OP|Brock|Ludicolo}})\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:Grovyle Pokéblock effect.png|thumb|200px|\'\'Ashita no Joe\'\' reference]]\n* Before the context of {{tt|Haruka Delicious|May\'s Purple Surprise}} was known, the Japanese title of this episode was incorrectly translated as "May Deliciously Captures Munchlax".\n* The English dub title is a pun on the phrase "\'\'very, very interesting\'\'".\n* {{an|Brock}} mentions [[Natalie]] from \'\'[[AG012|The Lotad Lowdown]]\'\', who gave him the recipe book in that episode.\n* In \'\'[[AG075|Whiscash and Ash]]\'\', when [[Sullivan]] attempted to catch [[Nero]] with a [[Master Ball]], it ate the ball whole and got away without being caught. However, in this episode, Munchlax swallowed the Poké Ball May used and was caught from the inside-out, which contradicts the failed catch in \'\'Whiscash and Ash\'\'.\n* This is the first appearance of a [[Generation IV]] Pokémon in the main series, the Pokémon in question being a {{p|Munchlax}}. However, one did appear previously in \'\'[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]\'\'.\n* [[Ash\'s Grovyle]]\'s reaction to {{an|May}}\'s Purple Surprise is a reference to the ending of the boxing anime \'\'{{wp|Ashita no Joe}}\'\'.\n* This episode marks one of the rare occasions in which a member of {{TRT}} refers to one of the main protagonists by name. In this occasion, [[James]] calls May by her name.\n* This is one of the few episodes where {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} doesn\'t pop out after Team Rocket finishes their {{motto}}.\n\n===Errors===\n* In one scene, Munchlax\'s underbelly is colored cream instead of teal.\n* In the scene where James dropped the bag with Pokéblocks from Team Rocket\'s balloon, his swollen lips were colored yellow instead of red.\n* When {{m|Fire Spin}} rips a hole in [[Jessie]]\'s bag, she isn\'t wearing gloves.\n* After James runs out of the [[Pokémon Center]], his and Jessie\'s bags turn purple.\n* When May starts making "May\'s Purple Surprise", the {{i|Poké Ball}} shape on her bandanna is on the left side of her head.\n\n<gallery>\nAG117 Error.png|Jessie\'s missing glove\nAG117 error.png|Color error\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n====[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]====\n* Question: Trainers, Which of these Pokémon is not an evolution of {{p|Eevee}}?\n* Choices: {{p|Espeon}}, {{p|Bagon}}, {{p|Vaporeon}}\n* Answer: OK, Trainers!
