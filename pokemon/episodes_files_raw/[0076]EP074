Pokémon League Opening Ceremony!\'\') is the 74th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on December 10, 1998 and in the United States on October 23, 1999. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/02_20-all-fired-up/-->\n<i>On the day before the Pokémon League Tournament, Ash, Brock and Misty watch as the torchbearer runs by on his way to Indigo stadium. They learn that it is the flame of a Moltres, a legendary Pokémon that stands for the whole spirit of the Pokémon League that lights the torch. Ash\'s excitement and nervousness build up to the next morning as he joins the other trainers in the march of the athletes. But, its Team Rocket once again who tries to spoil the moment when they attempt to steal the flame of the Moltres.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAt the [[Indigo Plateau]], {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} approach a large crowd that is cheering, and Ash thinks they are cheering for him. However, they are all actually cheering on the Torch Bearer, who is said to light up a huge flame that burns for the duration of the [[Indigo Plateau Conference]]. The flame is said to be derived from {{p|Moltres}} and represent the ambitions and competitive spirits of all {{pkmn|Trainer}}s. Impulsively, Ash approaches the Torch Bearer with the hopes of taking over the duty. However, he is confronted by [[Officer Jenny]], who explains that only approved competitors can hold the Torch. Ash shows that he is a competitor with his [[Badge]]s pinned to the inside of his shirt.\n\nJenny tells Ash that he needs to be approved, when a man arrives and says they should bend the rules by letting Ash be the Torch Bearer in honor of his spirit. Jenny introduces the man as [[Charles Goodshow]], the President of the Pokémon League Torch Committee. Goodshow reiterates that the competition is about spirit, and that Ash would be a perfect pick for the role of the Torch Bearer. As the previous Torch Bearer transfers the flame onto Ash\'s unlit torch, Ash explains to {{AP|Pikachu}} that it is very valuable and it shall be kept safe in his possession.\n\nJust then, {{TRT}}, intent on stealing the Torch and some Pokémon, traps Ash and Pikachu in a large sinkhole as they are running with the Torch. Team Rocket jumps out of their balloon; {{MTR}} lands on Ash and {{m|Fury Swipes|swipes}} him, causing Ash to let go of the Torch. Meowth catches it, but quickly throws it away after catching fire, allowing Pikachu to catch it. [[James]] sends out {{TP|James|Victreebel}} and commands it to bite Meowth to put out the flame. Instead, Victreebel catches fire as well and starts to chase Team Rocket. Ash sends out {{AP|Squirtle}} to put out [[Jessie]], James, Meowth, and Victreebel. Despite having been saved, Team Rocket explains to Ash that they will not stop trying to get the Torch because it could sell for a huge price and get them lots of money.\n\nJames jumps up and prepares to tackle Pikachu for the Torch, but it throws the torch away and uses an {{t|Electric}} attack on him. Ash and Jessie both go for the Torch, and get their hands on it. They begin grappling and Squirtle leaps onto Jessie\'s face to help Ash, while Meowth jumps onto Ash and begins tickling him. Jessie ultimately wrestles control of the Torch away from Ash, and Team Rocket soon drifts away in their balloon. Though Ash is initially distraught by this, Goodshow reveals a miniature lantern that he carries around his neck at all times, which holds a small flame taken from the fire of Moltres. Meanwhile, Jessie notices that the flame in the Torch is about to go out. Meowth explains that she just needed to turn it up, and operates a small switch on the bottom of the Torch handle. This causes a massive flareup that singes them all, before the flame completely goes out.\n\nAfter Officer Jenny uses the lantern flame to light a new Torch, Ash resumes running, and goes on to pass the flame to {{an|Misty}}, who runs to {{an|Brock}} and gives the Torch to him. Brock then runs to Goodshow and gives the Torch to him, whereupon he invites the group to the opening ceremony, which will take place the following day. In the evening, Ash and his friends are mingling with other Trainers when they meet up with {{Gary}} and [[Gary\'s cheerleaders|his cheerleader entourage]]. He soon leaves after some gloating and snide comments. Overnight, Ash becomes restless with worry from Gary\'s comments and goes out for a walk. He heads to the [[Indigo Plateau]] stadium while Goodshow sits amongst the grandstands and watches on. There, Ash resolves to beat the Pokémon League.\n\nThe next day, the opening ceremony of the League begins with the competitors walking onto the field. The last Torch Bearer is about to light the flame when Team Rocket, disguised as League officials, swipes the torch from her. {{TP|James|Weezing}} uses {{m|Smog}}, and Jessie lights the main flame. Then, Team Rocket heads inside a robot and puts the Moltres Flame on its back. Pikachu attempts to electrocute the robot, but it resists the electricity. Team Rocket attempts to incinerate Ash while using the flame, but Moltres suddenly appears and obliterates Team Rocket\'s mecha, blasting them off. The crowd seems unfazed, as Moltres reignites the Stadium Torch\'s flame. Despite the distraction, Ash and the other competitors set their sights on the burning Stadium Torch and listen to Goodshow\'s welcome speech.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

In \'\'[[EP057|The Breeding Center Secret]]\'\', Victreebel\'s dub voice was provided by [[Eric Stuart]], but from this episode onward, the dub leaves Victreebel\'s Japanese voice undubbed.\n* This is the first episode to feature a Legendary Pokémon whose name is mentioned in the episode, as Ash\'s Pokédex didn\'t recognize {{an|Ho-Oh}} in \'\'[[EP001|Pokémon - I Choose You!]]\'\' and Gary\'s Pokédex failed to recognize the armored {{OBP|Mewtwo|original series}} in \'\'[[EP063|The Battle of the Badge]]\'\'.\n* Another example of [[anime physics]] appears in this episode. When Victreebel swallowed a burning Meowth to put out the flame, the fire continued to burn, even though its oxygen had been cut off.\n\n===Errors===\n* When Team Rocket first do their motto, James appears to be wearing shoes rather than boots.\n* In the {{pmin|Sweden|Swedish}} dub, when the truck drives down into the hole that {{TRT}} dug, Ash can be heard falling down the hole despite not falling down the hole.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[Pikachu\'s Jukebox]]: [[What Kind of Pokémon Are You?]]\n* The Pokémon League flame is referred to as the 聖火 (sacred flame) in the Japanese version and just "the torch" in the dub.\n* Misty and Brock\'s reactions to Ash\'s excitement are slightly more out of cynicism than surprise in the dub.\n* Misty mentions [[Ash\'s Charizard]] as an example why he wouldn\'t be able to catch and train Moltres in the dub. In the original, she doubts Ash\'s skills in general.\n* Ash initially mistakes Charles Goodshow for [[Santa Claus]] in the dub, despite the fact that he had met Santa prior in \'\'[[Holiday Hi-Jynx]]\'\'. In the original, he just asks who the "old geezer" is.\n* During the scene where Ash, Misty, and Brock carry the torch, the second verse of the \'\'[[Pokémon Theme]]\'\' is used in the dub.\n** In the original Japanese version, \'\'[[Aim to Be a Pokémon Master]]\'\' is used.\n** In the {{pmin|Sweden|Swedish}} dub, the Pokémon Theme started from the beginning.\n* Ash\'s monologue when he\'s laying in bed after remembering Brock and Gary\'s discouraging remarks is completely different between the dub and original. In the dub, he says they\'re both wrong and that he will win. In the original, he says he needs to get some sleep because the competition starts the next day.\n* Following this, at the stadium, Ash expresses doubt in the dub that he might not be ready or no good, then reaffirms that he will win if he does the very best he can. In the original, he reminds himself that this is where he will battle and that he has to fight the only way he knows how.\n* Charles Goodshow tells Ash that they could use a spirited young man like him to deliver the flame to \'\'\'Indigo Stadium\'\'\', this was changed to \'\'\'Indigostaden\'\'\' (Indigo City) in the {{pmin|Sweden|Swedish}} dub.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=AAFFAA|bordercolor=FFAAAA\n|zh_cmn={{tt|開火，神奇寶貝聯盟的火焰|Opening Fire, Flame of the Pokémon League}}\n|cs={{tt|Plamenné zahájení turnaje|Flamy opening of the tournament}}\n|da={{tt|Nu Går Det Løs|It\'s Off Now}}\n|nl={{tt|In Vuur en Vlam!|All Fired Up!}}\n|fi={{tt|Poltetta veressä|Fire in blood}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|La Team Rocket met le feu|Team Rocket on fire}}\n|de={{tt|Im Zeichen der Flamme|In sign of the flame}}\n|he=הכל נשרף {{tt|\'\'Ha\'kol nisraf\'\'|Everything burned}}\n|hi=मै हूँ तैयार पोकेमोन लीग के लिए!{{tt|\'\'Main hoon tayar Pokemon league ke liye!\'\'|I am prepared for the Pokémon League!}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n|hu={{tt|Az örök láng|The Eternal Flame}}\n|it={{tt|Il grande torneo|The great tournament}}\n|ko=시작! 포켓몬 리그\n|no={{tt|I fyr og flamme|In fire and flames}}\n|pl={{tt|Tajemniczy ogień|Mysterious fire}}\n|pt_br={{tt|No Maior Fogo!|On Full Fire!}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Todo Entusiasmado!|All Fired Up!}}\n|ro={{tt|Toți Sunt Aprinși|All Fired Up!}}\n|ru={{tt|Всё в огне!|All is in fire!}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Todos prendidos!|All fired up!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|A todo gas|On full throttle}}\n|sv={{tt|Pokémonelden|The Pokémon fire}}\n}}\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP073 |\nprevtitle=Bad to the Bone |\nnextcode=EP075 |\nnexttitle=Round One - Begin! |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Kanto}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0074}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|074]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Hideki Sonoda]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Kiyotaka Itani]]\n[[Category:Episodes by one-time directors]]\n[[Category:Episodes by one-time animation directors]]\n[[Category:Pokémon League episodes]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Ash]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a Legendary Pokémon appears]]\n\n[[de:Im Zeichen der Flamme]]\n[[es:EP076]]\n[[fr:EP074]]\n[[it:EP074]]\n[[ja:無印編第74話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第75集]]'}
