It first aired in Japan on August 18, 2019 and is scheduled to air in the United States on December 21, 2019.\n{{spoilers}}\n<!--\n==Blurb==\nOfficial Blurb from Pokémon.com goes here, with source link-->\n<!--Please do not alter the blurb to fix any errors, they are meant to be presented as they are on the official site.-->\n\n==Plot==\nAs his semifinals match against {{an|Gladion}} approaches, {{an|Kiawe}} takes on {{Ash}} in a training {{pkmn|battle}}. [[Kiawe\'s Turtonator]] strikes {{AP|Torracat}} with {{m|Dragon Tail}}, while Torracat responds with {{m|Revenge}} that pushes Turtonator back. The boys end their training session after Torracat\'s {{m|Fire Blast}} collides with Turtonator\'s {{m|Flamethrower}}. Later, the group goes to the docks to meet up with Kiawe\'s sister [[Mimo]], but find she is nowhere in sight. {{an|Sophocles}}, having spoken to the concierge, informs Kiawe that the boat arrived 30 minutes earlier. Kiawe rushes over to the [[Manalo Stadium]], suspecting Mimo went there.\n\nMeanwhile, Mimo is lost as she wonders atop of the stadium, when she spots {{tc|Team Skull Grunt}} trio [[Tupp]], [[Rapp]] and [[Zipp]] graffitiing the pavement. She orders them to stop, but the grunts decide to send out their Pokémon to deal with her. As they prepare to attack, [[Gladion\'s Silvally]] steps in and lashes the grunt’s Pokémon with an {{m|Air Slash}}. Gladion orders thee trio to scram. Tupp, however, refuses to back down until Gladion’s intimidating glare proves too much and the grunts leave. Gladion [[recall]]s Silvally to its [[Premier Ball]]. Mimo introduces herself, explaining that she hopes to see brother battle today. Gladion realizes Mimo is Kiawe\'s younger sister and escorts her to the stadium. Mimo grabs a hold of Gladion’s hand, causing Gladion to remember his own sister, Lillie, though he brushes the thought off. On their way, Kiawe rushes to hug his sister, overjoyed to see that she is fine. He then realizes Gladion is standing there, and Mimo clarifies that Gladion saved her from Team Skull. Kiawe thanks him, though Gladion replies that it was nothing. Lillie and the others suddenly arrive and are relieved to see Mimo is fine. Mimo apologizes for making them worry, though Kiawe remind her that next she should wait till he arrives. Gladion decides to make a move, and Kiawe replies that he will see him at the match. Mimo is left puzzled, and she is then shocked to learn that her big brother is facing Gladion. Kiawe assures Mimo that everything will be fine, declaring that with her support he will be unbeatable. Mimo, however, has her doubts.\n\n{{TRT}}, in their food truck, toast each other with drinks for selling all of their doughnuts before noon. They quickly feel at odds however, admitting that something is amiss. {{MTR}} realizes that they are on the verge of losing their evil. [[Jessie]] and [[James]], now proudly wearing their [[Team Rocket]] uniforms, declare that they will aim to perform righteous evil, setting their sights on steal the [[Manalo Conference]] trophy prizes. Meowth adds that they need a bigger plan, suggesting they steal all of the contestants\' Pokémon. James notes that they will need a new mecha to achieve their goals, so Jessie states they need to get funding for that. Team Rocket then glumly realize that they will need to continue selling doughnuts to fund their evil schemes. Back at [[Bewear\'s den]], {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Stufful}} and {{an|Bewear}} step out of their hot spring after feeling hungry. The {{p|Oranguru}} robot emerges from the tree hollow and offers the pair a bowl of honey-dipped {{Berries}} to enjoy. Bewear and Stufful promptly return to relaxing in the water with their snack.\n\n[[Guzma]] greets his gang of grunts, declaring that he will destroy the entire League. As the grunts cheer, [[Plumeria]] warns Guzma not to let his guard down when he faces Ash in the semi-finals. Guzma brushes off her concerns, declaring that he is an unbeatable Trainer. Plumeria looks despondent as the grunts cheer for their leader, and she admits that they don\'t realize why Guzma is undefeated.\n\nOn the battlefield, Kiawe and Gladion confront each other. [[Olivia]] steps onto the battlefield as the referee, but trips over. After recovering, Olivia declares that she wants to see the most out of both opponents, adding that both sides will now use two Pokémon. Kiawe calls out his {{TP|Kiawe|Marowak}}, while Gladion selects {{TP|Gladion|Lycanroc}}. Kiawe makes the first move, but Lycanroc dodges, and jumps away as the {{m|Bonemerang}} makes its return. Lycanroc powers up with {{m|Swords Dance}} before unleashing a {{m|Stone Edge}}. Marowak evades the jagged stones and rushes in for a retaliatory {{m|Iron Head}}. Lycanroc is prepared as it strikes Marowak with Stone Edge, sending Marowak flying onto the field. Kiawe tries another strategy, and uses {{m|Flare Blitz}} to evade Lycanroc\'s Stone Edge defense before hitting it with an Iron Head. As Marowak leaps away, Lycanroc quickly recovers and responses with a Stone Edge to knock Marowak out of the match.\n\nMimo starts to cry, but instantly cheers up when Kiawe calls out his next Pokémon, Turtonator. Gladion has Lycanroc use Stone Edge, though Turtonator demolishes the move with its Dragon Tail and swats Lycanroc into a wall. As Lycanroc recovers, Turtonator readies another Dragon Tail. Lycanroc braces for impact, with its {{m|Counter}} staving off the attack and sending both sides backwards. The two sides stand back up, and Turtonator soon engulfs its opponent in a Flamethrower. Gladion has Lycanroc take the attack, causing it to enter its red-eyed state, before launching into an {{m|Outrage}}. Turtonator turns its back and Lycanroc rushes directly into an explosive {{m|Shell Trap}}, which takes Gladion by surprise. Lycanroc, however, is still energized and rushes in for another Outrage. Kiawe orders another Shell Trap, but Lycanroc bypasses Turtonator and strikes it from the front. Kiawe is in distress, as Outrage should\'ve made Lycanroc uncontrollable. Lycanroc then unleashes a barrage of punches, striking Turtonator each time. Kiawe orders Turtonator to focus and endure the attacks. As Lycanroc takes a swing at Turtonator’s central hole in its shell, Turtonator unleashes a ball of energy which [[Caster]] announces was a {{m|Focus Blast}}. Kiawe is pleased and has Turtonator follow up with another Focus Blast which defeats Gladion’s Lycanroc. As the battle turns to a one-on-one clash, Gladion sends out his Silvally to take on Turtonator.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
