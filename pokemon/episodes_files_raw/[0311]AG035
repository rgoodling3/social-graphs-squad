The First Pokémon Contest Challenge!!\'\') is the 35th episode of the {{series|Advanced Generation}}, and the 309th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on July 24, 2003 and in the United States on May 29, 2004. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/06_47-win-lose-or-drew/-->\n<i>May enters Beautifly in the beauty contest, but Team Rocket is too late to enter their Dustox. At the competitions, the person in line right before May is none other than her rival Drew. Drew\'s Roselia gives an excellent performance, netting him an extremely high score. May is more determined than ever to beat Drew.\n\nMeanwhile, Team Rocket is busy holding a "charity drive" scam for PokéBlocks. A little old man stops to talk to them about PokéBlocks. The contest is heating up with a Milotic stealing the show. May is up again in the contest and she and her Beautifly toss a disc back and forth, like they practiced before.\n\nIn the next round, she has to battle Drew who defeats her. He then looses to the contestant with the Milotic. May and Drew part on good terms and the scene ends with the old man still intently talking to a slumbering Team Rocket about PokéBlocks.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{an|May}} rushes towards the [[Contest Hall]] with {{Ash}}, {{AP|Pikachu}}, [[Max]], and {{an|Brock}} following behind. Luckily she makes it just before the cut off time. Realizing they have three hours to spare until the [[Slateport City]] [[Pokémon Contest]] begins, Brock asks what they should do. Ash admits he is hungry again from all the running, so the group leaves to find a restaurant. Afterwards, {{TRT}} strut into the Contest Hall and perform their {{motto}} for the receptionist. The lady then informs them that they have just missed the registration deadline, much to [[Jessie]]\'s disappointment. The trio sit on park bench wondering what to do next. They watch as a male {{pkmn|Trainer}} is busy {{pkmn|training}} with his {{p|Poochyena}}, rewarding it with some [[Pokéblock]]s. [[James]] suggests they sell Pokéblocks, with Jessie and {{MTR}} cheering to the money making scheme. Meanwhile, the Slateport Contest is about to get underway as [[Vivian Meridian|Vivian]] steps onto stage. She presents the Slateport [[Ribbon]] and introduces the [[Contest Judge|panel of judges]], formed by the Chief of the [[Pokémon Activities Committee]], [[Raoul Contesta]]; the {{pkmn|Fan Club Chairman|President}} of the [[Pokémon Fan Club]], [[Mr. Sukizo]]; and the {{pkmn|Center Nurse|operator}} of the [[Pokémon Center]], [[Nurse Joy]]. Backstage, May is anxious and her nerves are beginning to get to her. Ash, Max, and Brock comfort her as [[Drew]] smiles from around the corner.\n\nThe [[Appeal|Appeals Round]] begins and, one after another, [[Pokémon Coordinator]]s take the stage to showcase their {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} in such a way that their appearances and skills are highlighted. Soon it is Drew\'s turn and he tells his {{TP|Drew|Roselia}} to use {{m|Petal Dance}}, landing on the stage with a graceful curtsy. Roselia follows up with a twirling {{m|Stun Spore}} and {{m|Magical Leaf}} combination. For its grand finale, Roselia disappears into a blizzard of petals before slicing them with a Magical Leaf attack for a dazzling display. As Vivian comments on how beautiful it is, Drew earns the highest score yet, with a 29.4. Drew walks backstage and begins to talk to May. They are interrupted by {{ho|Robert}} as he and his {{p|Milotic}} begin to perform. Max comments that many say that Milotic is the most beautiful Pokémon and Brock agrees. Milotic uses {{m|Safeguard}}, causing it to radiate with a green glow. Ash rushes out to check his [[Pokédex]] on Milotic, and Max adds that it is considered the most beautiful Pokémon. Milotic fans out its tail to show off its magnificent scales to the roaring crowd. The last entrant, May is now up. She walks out onto the stage nervously. Vivian announces that this is her first Contest. May gets ready to send out {{TP|May|Beautifly}} but falls. Vivian asks if she is alright and May replies yes, getting to her feet and releasing Beautifly. May throws a frisbee and Beautifly uses {{m|String Shot}} to whip it back. May orders Beautifly to use {{m|Gust}} to send the frisbee back, though May almost fails to catch it. May then tells Beautifly use {{m|Silver Wind}} while spinning, which creates a Silver Wind tornado effect. May ends her performance with a bow and Beautifly landing on her head. Drew is mildly impressed and May earns a 24.9 much to her disappointment. May walks backstage and Drew hands her a rose, causing her to blush, until he explains that it is for Beautifly and not her, before saying that she still has a lot of training to do. Outside Team Rocket are dressed up and ready to sell, but have no Pokéblocks. They are thinking about stealing some from the contestants, but change plans when an old man approaches and offers to teach them the secrets about Pokéblocks. They immediately agree, excited about learning the secrets. The old man\'s lecture causes James to fall asleep as he tries to take down notes. \n\nMay and Drew watch as the eight Coordinators moving on to the [[Contest Battle]]s are revealed, including themselves and Robert. Brock worries that May has not had enough experience battling. May and Drew are facing each other as the second round match-ups begin. May sends out Beautifly and Drew calls out Roselia as the battle begins. Drew has Roselia use Magical Leaf and Beautifly counters with a Gust. The manoeuvre works momentarily, but the Magical leaf still injures Beautifly, costing May some of her valuable points. Drew informs May that Magical Leaf is a [[move]] that always hits. Roselia follows up with Stun Spore, but it doesn\'t affect Beautifly. Beautifly sends out String Shot, though it is shredded by Roselia\'s Magical Leaf, causing May to lose more points. May orders a Silver Wind, but it is countered by Petal Dance. Beautifly manages to fly up to avoid the petals as Drew then orders {{m|Solar Beam}}. May has Beautifly use String Shot, but Roselia has fully charged its attack and scores a direct hit on its opponent. Beautifly looks worse for wear as it drops to the battlefield in exhaustion. With only half the time up, the judges call the battle off. Drew is the winner and moves on to the next stage, much to the disappointment for May and her friends. The boys find May backstage as she struggles to control her tears. They try to comfort her, admitting that it is tough losing.\n\nMay\'s focus turns to the television screen as Drew takes on Robert\'s Milotic in the next round. Vivian reveals that Roselia has already taken some hits, and Robert appears to have the upper hand. Milotic lashes its opponent with an {{m|Iron Tail}}. Roselia sends out Magical Leaf, but Robert cuts through it with {{m|Twister}}. Robert is declared the winner and he goes on to win the whole Contest. May is cheering along with everyone else, having gotten over her sadness. As Drew leaves the Contest Hall, May runs out and tells him that she will win next time. Drew laughs and tells her that they will have to see about that. Back with Team Rocket, the man continues to tell them all about Pokéblocks till nightfall, unaware that his students are fast asleep.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{an|May}} enters the [[Slateport City]] [[Pokémon Contest]], making her debut as a {{pkmn|Coordinator}}.\n* [[Drew]] and {{ho|Robert}} enter the Slateport Contest as well.\n* Drew defeats May in the first round of the [[Contest Battle|Battle Stage]], eliminating her of the competition.\n* Robert defeats Drew in the finals, earning the Slateport [[Ribbon]].\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* [[Vivian Meridian]]\n* {{ho|Robert}}\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Milotic}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* [[Drew]]\n* [[Vivian Meridian]]\n* [[Raoul Contesta]]\n* [[Mr. Sukizo]]\n* {{ho|Robert}}\n* {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP AG035.png|thumb|200px|right|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Dustox}}\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Beautifly}} ({{OP|May|Beautifly}})\n* {{p|Roselia}} ({{OP|Drew|Roselia}})\n* {{p|Milotic}} ({{ho|Robert}}\'s; debut)\n* {{p|Psyduck}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Ponyta}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Bellossom}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Forretress}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Poochyena}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Wingull}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Shroomish}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Azurill}} (Coordinator\'s)\n\n==Trivia==\n* The episode\'s title is a reference to the phrase "\'\'win, lose, or draw\'\'", as well as an album of the {{wp|Win, Lose or Draw (album)|same name}} by {{wp|The Allman Brothers Band}}.\n* {{TRT}} doesn\'t blast off in this episode.\n* This episode featured the first speaking appearance of [[Raoul Contesta]] and [[Mr. Sukizo]].\n* {{TP|Drew|Roselia}}\'s performance was similar to [[Dawn\'s Ambipom]]\'s performance in \'\'[[DP061|Team Shocker!]]\'\', where the Pokémon disappeared from sight during their flashy big finish. However, unlike Ambipom, who didn\'t pass to the next round because of that, Roselia did.\n* This episode was the first to air in Japan after the theatrical release of \'\'[[M06|Jirach: Wish Maker]]\'\'.\n\n===Errors===\n* [[Drew]] is missing his sleeves in a short scene right after losing to {{ho|Robert}}.\n* The old man explains to Team Rocket that Spicy Pokéblock increases a Pokémon\'s Smartness. However, in the games, it actually increases Coolness.\n* {{Ash}} and [[Max]] state that {{TP|May|Beautifly}} has the advantage over Roselia because of its Bug typing. This is not true, as {{p|Roselia}} is part {{type|Poison}}, so {{type|Bug}} moves do normal damage to Roselia.\n* Vivian calls {{m|Solar Beam}} the most powerful {{type|Grass}} move. However, [[Generation III|at the time]], that title was taken by {{m|Frenzy Plant}}.\n<gallery>\nFile:AG035 Error.png|Drew\'s missing sleeves\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=9999FF|bordercolor=FF7777\n|zh_cmn={{tt|小遙！初次挑戰神奇寶貝華麗大賽！|May!
