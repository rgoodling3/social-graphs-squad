The Final Gym!!\'\') is the 108th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on August 12, 1999 and in the United States on September 9, 2000. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/03_03-pokemon-double-trouble/-->\n<i>Ash is anxious to square off against the Gym Leader who holds the final badge of the Orange League. But then he learns that this Gym Leader is none other than the kindly townswoman who just helped him rally against a Team Rocket sneak attack.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrive at [[Kumquat Island]] for Ash\'s fourth and final [[Orange League|Orange Crew]] {{pkmn|battle}}. As they are walking on the beach, a woman rushes in and abruptly hugs Ash. She then realizes what is happening and apologizes, saying that she mistook Ash for her son [[Travis]], who had, like Ash, started a Pokémon journey with a {{p|Pikachu}}. Just then, the beach is attacked by {{TRT}}\'s [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|Robo-Rhydon]], driven by {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}} and {{TP|Jessie|Lickitung}} and weaponized by {{TP|James|Weezing}}. [[Jessie]] tells Weezing to use {{m|Hyper Beam}}, but it instead uses {{m|Smog}}, to her disappointment. Nevertheless, the attack still causes beach-goers to flee in a panic.\n\nAsh decides to stop Team Rocket, but Jessie has Arbok use {{m|Poison Sting}} on Ash and {{AP|Pikachu}}. However, the woman has her {{p|Alakazam}} use {{m|Reflect}} to block the attack. She scolds Team Rocket, warning them to never return. Alakazam uses its {{m|Psychic}} to seal the mechanical Rhydon\'s mouth shut while another Smog attack is fired, subsequently filling Team Rocket\'s control cabin with smog. Ash sends out {{AP|Charizard}}, who uses {{m|Take Down}} on the robot. In the confusion, James inadvertently presses one of the buttons, causing Arbok to use {{m|Acid}}, which tears a hole in the Rhydon robot. Charizard responds with {{m|Flamethrower}}, which overloads the robot\'s machinery, causing it to explode and send Team Rocket flying.\n\nThe woman introduces herself as [[Luana]], the final member of the Orange Crew, and a local hotelier whose hotel includes a workout Gym and an indoor Pokémon stadium. Ash and his friends are invited to stay in her hotel\'s most exquisite suite free of charge, and they agree on a [[Double Battle]], to be held the next day, for the final Orange League Badge. In the match, both leader and challenger will use two {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} simultaneously, and the match ends when the first Pokémon is unable to battle, wherein the opposing team are declared the winners. While in the hotel\'s hot spring, Ash and Tracey discuss strategies. Ash is committed to have Pikachu battle, but Tracey surmises that Alakazam will battle. Lacking any {{t|Ghost}} or {{t|Bug}} types that could deal an effective blow, Ash ponders who else could stand up to Alakazam\'s power.\n\nThe next day, the battle begins, with Luana sending out Alakazam and {{p|Marowak}} against Pikachu and Charizard. However, it is revealed that before the match began, Pikachu and Charizard developed a grudge with one another following an innocuous stomp by Charizard that knocked Pikachu over. [[Sheldon]] calls for the match to begin and Pikachu rushes towards his opponents. However, Charizard\'s {{m|Flamethrower}} manages to hit Pikachu, burning the Mouse Pokémon\'s tail. Ash commands Charizard try to use {{m|Tackle}} on Alakazam. However, Alakazam\'s {{m|Psychic}} stops Charizard midair. As a result, Ash commands Pikachu to use {{m|Thunder Shock}}, but the attack hits Charizard instead. Ash scolds Pikachu, but the small Pokemon shrugs at his concerns.\n\nAfter momentarily watching on as Charizard takes successive {{m|Bonemerang}} and Psychic attacks, Pikachu Thunder Shocks Alakazam, freeing Charizard from its Psychic. Luana has Marowak use {{m|Body Slam}} on Pikachu, but Charizard manages to catch Pikachu with its wing. With the two now willing to cooperate, Charizard {{m|Fly|flies}} with Pikachu on its back, allowing Pikachu to use {{m|Thunderbolt}} on Marowak, disrupting its concentration. Meanwhile, Charizard continues to fly towards Alakazam, who prepares to land a {{m|Hyper Beam}} at point-blank range. When Charizard pulls up at the last minute, Alakazam is hit with Marowak\'s wayward Bonemerang attack, sending it and the charged Hyper Beam backwards. Much to Luana\'s shock, the Hyper Beam hits Marowak. Sheldon checks the two Pokémon and reveals they have been knocked out, earning Ash the victory.\n\nAfter Ash receives the {{Badge|Jade Star}} for the victory, Luana tells Ash that he is finally able to compete in the [[Orange League]] against the [[Orange Crew Supreme Gym Leader]] for the [[Winner\'s Trophy]]. Leaving Kumquat Island, Luana tells Ash that if he encounters Travis, he should deliver him a warm message from home. Ash and his friends sail away on {{AP|Lapras}}\'s back, waving to Luana and her hotel staff. Elsewhere, Team Rocket\'s cries for help remain unanswered and they are forced to wait out at sea on the remains of their Robo-Rhydon.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

However, it should be noted that this battle ends when either one of the {{pkmn|Trainer}}\'s Pokémon [[Fainting|faints]] as opposed to the Double Battles introduced [[Generation III|later]] in the {{pkmn|games}}, in which both opposing Pokémon would need to be knocked out to earn the win.\n* This is the first of two episodes that featured {{Tracey}} without his headband on.\n* This is the first episode to have a [[Battle judge|referee]] in a [[Gym]] battle. Almost every Gym battle has a referee from this point on.\n* Although James reveals that he had intended to teach his {{TP|James|Weezing}} {{m|Hyper Beam}}, he never does get around to actually teaching it.\n* After [[Luana]] reveals her status as [[Gym Leader]] in the English dub, Jessie comments "I don\'t care if you\'re in the Orange Crew or the Grapefruit League", possibly a stealth reference to Major League Baseball\'s Spring Training league in Florida.\n* This is the second episode in which {{Ash}} is mistaken for a woman\'s son, the first being \'\'[[EP027|Hypno\'s Naptime]]\'\'.\n\n===Errors===\n* Before the characters enter the Gym, Luana moves her mouth as if speaking but doesn\'t actually say anything.\n* In the training room of the hotel, a {{p|Sandslash}} has the voice of a {{p|Sandshrew}}.\n* When Ash sends out {{AP|Charizard}} to face {{TRT}}, his backpack disappears.\n* When Charizard uses {{m|Take Down}} on the {{p|Rhydon}} robot, the cream-colored spots on its soles disappears.\n* When Team Rocket blasts off, {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}}, {{TP|Jessie|Lickitung}}, and {{TP|James|Weezing}} disappear.\n* During the battle, Charizard is affected by {{m|Bonemerang}}, a move that shouldn\'t affect it because its part {{t|Flying}}.\n* Charizard uses {{m|Tackle}}, which he and his pre-evolutions [[Anime move errors|can\'t learn in the games]].\n* {{p|Marowak}} is affected by {{AP|Pikachu}}\'s {{m|Thunderbolt}}, but it shouldn\'t have affected Marowak since it is a {{type|Ground}}.\n* In the {{pmin|Poland|Polish}} dub, after Weezing uses {{m|Smog}}, Meowth states that James can\'t learn {{m|Hyper Beam}} by himself.\n\n<gallery>\nAsh Charizard Take Down.png|Charizard\'s soles error\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[Pikachu\'s Jukebox]]: [[Together Forever]]\n* Part of the scene where Luana hugs Ash and squishes his face in-between her breasts, thinking that he is her son, is removed from the dub.\n* A scene with a {{p|Jynx}} on a treadmill, a {{p|Pinsir}} attacking a punchbag, and a {{p|Venusaur}} lifting dumbbells was removed, possibly because it contained Jynx in its original design.\n* During Ash\'s Gym battle, Luana commands her Marowak to use {{m|Body Slam}} on Pikachu in the English dub. In the original Japanese version, she commands Marowak to use {{m|Double-Edge}}.\n\n<gallery>\nKumquat Island Jynx Pinsir.png|Deleted scene\n</gallery>\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FFDDAA|bordercolor=FFBB55\n|bg={{tt|Покемон – двойни проблеми|Pokémon – double problems}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|接棒決戰，最後的道館！|Tag Battle, The Final Gym}}\n|cs={{tt|Dvojité problémy|Double problems}}\n|nl={{tt|De Dubbele Uitdaging|The Double Challenge}}\n|de={{tt|Der Pokémon-Doppelkampf|The Pokémon-double fight}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Double match Pokémon|Pokémon double battle}}\n|he=קרב כפול {{tt|\'\'Krav Kaful\'\'|Double Battle}}\n|hu={{tt|Csapatszellem|Team Spirit}}\n|it={{tt|Doppio incontro|Double match}}{{tt|*|Original 2000 dub}} <br> {{tt|Partita doppia|Double match}}{{tt|*|2014 K2 TV dub}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Pokémon Encrenca em Dobro|Double Trouble Pokémon}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Duplo Sarilho de Pokémon|Pokémon Double Trouble}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Prepárense para los problemas Pokémon!|Prepare for Pokémon trouble!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Doble problema Pokémon|Pokémon double trouble}}\n|pl={{tt|Podwójne kłopoty|Double trouble}}\n|ro={{tt|Pericol Dublu Pokémon|Double Danger Pokémon}}\n|hi=Ash ने जीता  आखरी ऑरेंज लीग बैज {{tt|\'\'Ash ne jeeta aakhri Orange league badge!\'\'| Ash won the final Orange league Badge!}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}} \n}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP107 |\nprevtitle=Pokémon Food Fight! |\nnextcode=EP109 |\nnexttitle=The Wacky Watcher! |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Orange}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0108}}\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Sato Yamamoto]]\n[[Category:Episodes by one-time directors]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Ash]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which Ash gets a Badge]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Toshiaki Suzuki]]\n[[Category:Episodes with Gym battles]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Hideki Sonoda]]\n[[Category:Original series episodes|108]]\n\n[[de:Der Pokémon-Doppelkampf]]\n[[es:EP110]]\n[[fr:EP108]]\n[[it:EP108]]\n[[ja:無印編第108話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第109集]]'}
