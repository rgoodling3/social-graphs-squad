It first aired in Japan on November 21, 2013 and in the United States on March 1, 2014.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/17_07-giving-chase-at-the-rhyhorn-race/-->\n<i>Ash, Clemont, and Bonnie convince Serena to join them on their travels! She returns a handkerchief Ash lent her long ago at Pokémon Summer Camp, and he finally remembers her as the girl in the straw hat. He used his handkerchief to wrap up her knee after she hurt it in a fall at camp, and she’s kept it ever since!\nThey’re still reminiscing when they’re interrupted by a rumbling roar, and then see several Rhyhorn, with riders on their backs, pounding toward them! Apparently the track they’re walking along is really a Rhyhorn racecourse—and the race is in full swing! Officer Jenny takes them into Odyssey Village and shows them where the racing Rhyhorn live. She says that tomorrow, the race will be open to first-timers, and Ash is excited to enter!\n\nHe quickly realizes he doesn’t know the first thing about Rhyhorn racing—he even has trouble getting up onto Rhyhorn’s back. But Serena’s mom used to be a Rhyhorn racer, so Serena is pretty good at this stuff, and she shows him the ropes. She even shares her mom’s advice, “Be one with Rhyhorn,” which seems to help Ash get the hang of things!\n\nThe next day, it’s time for the race! Of course, the Team Rocket trio have been lurking about as usual, and they interrupt the race in an attempt to catch the racing Rhyhorn—and Pikachu, too! Ash and the other racers are tied up and unable to help, but Clemont, Serena, and Bonnie are soon on the scene! Clemont and Bonnie free the captured Rhyhorn while Serena and Fennekin hold Team Rocket at bay, and then the Rhyhorn close in to send the villains blasting off again.\nBefore leaving the village, Serena calls her mom to introduce her new friends and share her travel plans! Ash, Clemont, Bonnie, and Serena excitedly make preparations to head out for Cyllage City. But first, Serena has a gift for Ash! She baked some cookies to recognize his hard work, and to thank him for helping her all those years ago. There are enough cookies for everyone, so they won’t be traveling on an empty stomach as the journey continues!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} are departing [[Santalune City]], when Ash queries {{an|Serena}} as to her next destination. She hesitates, unsure, but Ash invites her to join their group, a suggestion that {{an|Clemont}} and {{an|Bonnie}} immediately agree to. Serena agrees and uses her guidebook to inform them that in order to reach [[Cyllage City]], the site of Ash\'s next Gym battle, they must first travel through Lumiose City.\n\nWhile in the woods leading to Lumiose City, Ash contemplates challenging the Lumiose Gym again. Upon Clemont\'s recommendation, Ash begins to search for a Pokémon to catch. In the meantime, Clemont asks Serena why she decided to go on a journey in the first place. Serena explains that she wants to return Ash\'s handkerchief to him and explains how they had met so many years ago. At [[Professor Oak]]\'s Summer Camp, an event attended by both Ash and Serena, Serena had gotten lost in a forest and fell over after being startled by a wild {{p|Poliwag}}, injuring her knee in the process. Serena was frightened and called out for [[Grace (Kalos)|her mother]]. Soon after, Ash, who was looking for the same Poliwag, found her and wrapped his handkerchief around her knee in order to help her get back on her feet. He then gave Serena the advice to "never give up until it\'s over", a phrase that Ash and many of his friends, including Serena, has repeated throughout the anime series. After helping Serena to her feet, Ash had led her out of the forest and back to the camp.\n\nAfter Serena relates this story and returns the handkerchief to Ash, he finally remembers her. Serena also says that she wanted to see Ash again as well as give his handkerchief back, but that she never expected that he wouldn\'t recognize her. Suddenly, the ground begins trembling as a group of {{p|Rhyhorn}} racers speed down the forest path. [[Officer Jenny]] drives up soon after, informing the group that they are on a Rhyhorn race track. She takes them to the track\'s starting line as Serena explains the rules of Rhyhorn racing to Ash. After Officer Jenny convinces Ash to participate in a race the next day, the group parts ways with her at a Rhyhorn stable, and Serena gives Ash advice on how to properly approach and ride Rhyhorn. Meanwhile, {{TRT}} is watching them and plot to steal the Rhyhorn and {{AP|Pikachu}}.\n\nAfter they change into Rhyhorn racing outfits, Serena begins training Ash on how to ride a Rhyhorn properly. However, the Rhyhorn keeps throwing Ash off and Serena shows him the proper technique. However, when she tries to make Rhyhorn run, it throws her off and the Rhyhorn all begin eagerly licking her (and eventually Bonnie as well). At this, Serena realizes that the Rhyhorn are actually very friendly Pokémon. Later, Ash begins riding and his skills improve. Surprising herself, Serena gives Ash the same advice that her mother had given her [[XY002|not too long ago]]. As a result, Serena realizes that maybe she has misjudged Rhyhorn racing. That night, while everyone is sleeping, Serena bakes cookies for the group while {{TP|Serena|Fennekin}} watches her.\n\nThe next day, the race is set to begin. As the {{WP|Racing flags#Green flag|green flag}} waves to start the race, Ash and his Rhyhorn get off to a shaky start, but they manage to catch up to the other racers after a while. However, [[James\'s Inkay]] squirts ink on the cameras broadcasting the race, prompting Serena, Clemont, Bonnie, and Fennekin to go investigate. Meanwhile, Ash is confused that he can\'t see any of the other Rhyhorn racers, but a net suddenly drops out of the sky and snares him as Pikachu and Rhyhorn are captured in a cage. Team Rocket appears, reciting their {{motto}}, and Ash sees the other racers tied up the same way he is and their Rhyhorn stolen as well. As {{MTR}} starts to drive the train of cages away, he and parts of the cages are hit by a {{m|Mud Shot}} from [[Clemont\'s Bunnelby]] as Clemont arrives to battle Team Rocket. Serena, Bonnie, and Fennekin approach from the other direction and, much to everyone\'s surprise, Fennekin asks Serena to battle Team Rocket. Fennekin uses an {{m|Ember}} attack, causing [[James]] to drop the device that controls the cages. Before [[Jessie]] or James can stop to pick it up, Clemont grabs a rock and aggressively smashes the device, which frees Pikachu and the Rhyhorn. Surrounded by the angry Rhyhorn, Team Rocket is sent mercilessly blasting off as Officer Jenny arrives to check on the situation.\n\nLater that evening, Ash, Clemont and Bonnie introduce themselves to Serena\'s mother, as Ash tells her about Serena teaching him to ride a Rhyhorn. Embarrassed, Serena tells her mother that she will be traveling with Ash, Clemont, and Bonnie, which her mother agrees to be a wonderful experience for her. Later, Serena gives Ash a pouch containing the cookies that she made earlier, which she says is a thank-you gift for what happened when they were younger. She also gives cookies to Clemont and Bonnie.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
