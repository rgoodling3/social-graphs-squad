It first aired in Japan on April 27, 2017 and in the United States on July 22, 2017.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/20_24-alolan-open-house/-->\n<i>It’s Open House day at the Pokémon School, and Ash’s mom has made a surprise visit to see his special presentation! Ash is really nervous about speaking in front of everyone, and Rotom Dex offers to use its new voice-sampling function so it can do the talking instead.\n\nThe trick works at first, but Rotom Dex gets carried away, citing complicated research at top speed until Professor Kukui figures out what’s going on. He gives Ash another chance to talk about what he’s learned in Alola, and this time, it comes from the heart. Ash’s friends promise to help him learn even more, and his mom couldn’t be prouder!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} is working on a speech for Family Visit Day at the [[Pokémon School]] when {{Delia}} and [[Mimey]] appear at the door. They reveal that they came from [[Kanto]] to attend the Family Visit Day, and to see Ash\'s presentation. Ash introduces them to his Pokémon and {{Rotom}}, which Delia nicknames them. As {{AP|Litten}} walks past Delia, she picks it up and pet it. {{an|Professor Kukui}} offers Delia tea and Ash goes to take care of it. While in the kitchen, he overhears the adults talking about his report. He panics until Rotom offers a solution. Meanwhile, {{AP|Rockruff}} and {{AP|Rowlet}} join Litten in Delia\'s cuddling.\n\nThe next day, Ash, Delia, and Litten meet with [[Anela]] from the market. {{an|Lillie}}, [[Snowy]] and [[Hobbes]] introduce themselves to Ash\'s mother. Delia is surprised to see the white Vulpix, which Ash explains that it is an {{alo|Vulpix}}. [[Samson Oak]] and his Vulpix walk out to greet them. In the classroom, they meet up with {{ashcl}}. Many parents of the students are present in the classroom. {{an|Mallow}} notices Ash\'s mother, and explains that her parents are busy at the [[Aina\'s Kitchen|restaurant]]. Kiawe says that his parents are busy with the farm. {{an|Sophocles}} waves to his parents. {{an|Lana}}\'s sisters [[Harper and Sarah]] are running all over the place but their [[Lana\'s mother|mother]] calms them down. Ash\'s classmates ask him if he is ready for his presentation. Ash exclaims that he will be fine.\n\nKukui invites Ash to the front of the class to present his report. As Ash speaks, it was revealed in a flashback that Rotom uses his voice sampling feature to help Ash on the report. Rotom, with Ash\'s voice, explains about the differences of the regular and Alolan Vulpix. Sophocles\'s father is impressed with Ash\'s report, however his classmates get suspicious. Kukui sees Rotom in Ash\'s back, and realizes what happened. Rotom starts to malfunction and begins talking at a fast pace, and doing different replications. Professor Kukui finally removes Rotom from Ash\'s shirt, and his classmates are impressed with Rotom\'s voice imitation. Kukui tells him to do it on his own this time, on what he had learnt since he came to [[Alola]]. Delia encourages her son. Ash starts to talk about his journey in Alola, his new Pokémon, and how he enjoys everyone\'s support. The school bell rings and Kukui tells everyone to have a look around the school. Delia hears a commotion from below.\n\nDownstairs, three {{tc|Team Skull Grunt}}s—[[Tupp]], [[Zipp]], and [[Rapp]]—are looking to ride the {{p|Tauros}}. They begin wreaking havoc and attacking the visitors when Delia steps in. She decides to battle the grunts with Litten. Rapp commands her {{p|Zubat}} to use {{m|Bite}} while Delia tells Litten to dodge it, and Litten uses {{m|Scratch}}. Ash comes forward and decides to battle alongside his mother. He sends in {{AP|Pikachu}} and Rockruff. Zubat, {{p|Salandit}}, and {{p|Garbodor}} use {{m|Toxic}} but Pikachu, Rockruff, and Litten dodge it. Pikachu uses {{m|Quick Attack}} while Rockruff uses Bite and Litten uses Scratch. Ash and Pikachu finish the battle with a {{m|Gigavolt Havoc}}, and Team Skull retreats. Delia congratulates Pikachu and Litten on the battle while mimicking the [[Z-Move]] pose with Litten in her hands. His classmates exclaims the similarity between Ash and his mother. Everyone volunteers to clean up the damage.\n\nDelia leaves to return to Kanto and jokes about bringing Litten back with her, to which Ash objects. She later bids farewell to her son and Professor Kukui.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
