It was first broadcast in Japan on December 2, 1997 and in the United States on October 23, 1998.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/01_34-the-bridge-bike-gang/-->\n<i>In the course of a journey, one meets up with many different things. Returning to civilization after a long period of wandering, our heroes find a bridge that reaches 20 kilometers in length. There is no way to reach Sunnytown—on the other side of the bridge—but by crossing. The bridge, however, has been designed especially for bicycles. The party tries to purchase bicycles in order to cross the bridge, but lacking the funds and otherwise at a complete loss, they decide to stop by the Pokémon Center and re-evaluate their plans. At the Pokémon Center, by pure luck, a job awaits them—delivering medicine to Sunnytown.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}}, {{an|Misty}}, and {{an|Brock}} come across a bridge, but when they try to walk on it, an officer named {{OBP|Norman|EP036}} says only the bike track was ready, not the actual road. Devastated, {{ashfr|the group}} then sees a [[Bicycle|bike]] store, though their prices prove to be expensive. The group retreats to the [[Pokémon Center]] to think of a plan to get a bike. Suddenly, a worried [[Nurse Joy]] appears and says she had to deliver medicine for injured {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} over the bridge to [[Sunnytown]], but she cannot leave the Center because she has Pokémon to attend to. Ash and Misty agree to carry out the task for her after Nurse Joy informs them she has several spare bikes. Misty and Brock ride a tandem bicycle, whilst Ash leads in his single bike, enjoying the bridge\'s view and fresh air. Meanwhile, below the bridge, [[James]] rows an inflatable boat whilst [[Jessie]] and {{MTR}} peer through their binoculars and notice Ash and his friends. Jessie and James mention the area could almost be considered their hometown and make plans to target {{AP|Pikachu}}.\n\nJust after Ash and his friends finish their refreshments, they find themselves surrounded by a group of wild bikers. They tried to escape, but the gang\'s leader [[Chopper]] challenges Ash to a {{pkmn|battle}}. He sends out his {{p|Golem}} and Ash calls on {{AP|Bulbasaur}}. Golem\'s shell protects it from Bulbasaur\'s {{m|Vine Whip}} and it easily wins with a single {{m|Tackle}}. Ash then sends out {{AP|Charmander}}, who sets Golem alight with its {{m|Flamethrower}} and {{m|Fire Spin}}. Golem\'s Tackle misses Charmander, and it strikes several of the gang members instead. Chopper withdraws his Golem, but the {{i|Poké Ball}} is still hot from Charmander\'s attack.\n\nNext, [[Tyra]], the other leader of the bike gang, sends out {{p|Cloyster}} against Misty, who tries to send out {{TP|Misty|Starmie}}, but {{TP|Misty|Psyduck}} appears instead. Misty decides to give it a chance, but Psyduck\'s attacks repeatedly backfire on it. Before Psyduck has a chance to develop a headache from Cloyster\'s own attacks, {{TRT}} arrives, riding on unicycles and saying their {{motto}}. They receive a heroes\' welcome from the bicycle gang, who refer to Jessie as "Chainer Jessie" and "Big Jess" for her penchant of swinging a chain around as she rode her bike, and James as "Little Jim" and "Trainer James" because he was the only one in the group who had to use training wheels. Just as Team Rocket and the bike gang begin to attack Ash, Misty, and Brock, the police arrive. The bike gang immediately rides off, almost leaving Team Rocket behind. When [[Officer Jenny]] arrives, she offers them a ride, though she retracts her offer after being called to another emergency. As the [[weather]] becomes ferocious and turns into a storm, the bicycle gang and Team Rocket seek refuge in a building. Chopper and Tyra then challenge Team Rocket to ride through the storm on their unicycles. The whole trio falls for the peer pressure and accepts the task.\n\nIn [[Sunnytown]], Nurse Joy calls the other Pokémon Center; she is worried that medicine hasn\'t arrived to cure the injured Pokémon, a {{p|Shellder}}. As Ash and his friends continue to ride through the rainstorm, the bridge lifts to allow a ship to pass through. However, they determinedly continue riding. Simultaneously, Team Rocket are trying their hardest to pedal their unicycles up the other side of the upturned bridge. Just as Ash, Misty, and Brock are not going to make it, they see Team Rocket jumping from the other side and promptly bounce on their heads, sending the trio into the water while allowing themselves to be propelled upward and on to the other side. As they pass the bike gang, they are challenged to a battle. When Ash refuses and tells them that he is delivering medicine for a sick Pokémon, the gang decides to escort them. They arrive in time, and Nurse Joy quickly pours the medicine into the tank, instantly improving Shellder\'s condition. Misty phones through to the other town\'s Nurse Joy, alerting her to their arrival. The bike gang promptly calls Ash and Misty "Awesome Ash" and "Mighty Misty". Brock tells Tyra that she can call him "Honey", only to receive a slap.\n\nMeanwhile, Team Rocket emerges out of the water, stacked on a single unicycle and covered in seaweed.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

However, Golem\'s shell is protected from being hit with Vine Whip, even though Grass-type moves should be super effective on Rock- and Ground-types.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[PokéRap]]: Day 1 (Version 2)\n* Originally, Misty wanted curry while Brock wanted \'\'{{wp|Chazuke|ochazuke}}\'\' or pancakes. In the English version, Misty wants a hot dog while Brock wants deep-dish extra cheese pizza.\n* The Pokémon Center\'s poster had text removed.\n* Misty complains about doing all the work on the bike she and Brock share, while originally she was upset because she wanted a bike only she rode, not a shared bike.\n* Big Jess and Little Jim were originally addressed with 姉御 \'\'Anego\'\' (big sister) and 兄貴 \'\'Aniki\'\' (big brother).\n** Jessie\'s original nickname was チェーンのムサシ \'\'Chēn no Musashi\'\' (Chain {{tt|Musashi|Jessie}}) instead of Chainer Jessie. While James\'s was 補助輪のコジロウ \'\'Hojorin no Kojirō\'\' (Training Wheels {{tt|Kojirō|James}}) instead of Trainer James.\n* In the Danish dub, Norman\'s dialogue is altered to include a contemporary pop culture reference to {{wp|Scandlines}} TV commercial characters Kaj and Bøje, a pair of seagulls.\n* In the Swedish dub, Norman states that the bridge is \'\'en och en halv mil\'\', 15 kilometers.\n* In the Swedish dub, in the end, Jessie and James say "nu är det Jul igen" \'(\'now it\'s Christmas again\'\'), probably making a pun on the fact that \'\'hjul\'\' (\'\'wheel\'\') and \'\'Jul\'\' (\'\'Christmas\'\') have the same pronunciation and the fact that they are cycling on a unicycle.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=AFA|bordercolor=FAA\n|zh_cmn={{tt|暴風雨的單車路 / 暴风雨的单车路|Big Storm at Cycling Road}}\n|cs={{tt|Kolařský gang|The bicycle gang}}\n|da={{tt|Brobisserne|definite plural of a term referring to a bridge construction worker.
