(Japanese: '''鋼鉄島の遺跡！''' ''The Ruins of {{tt|Steel Island|Iron Island}}!'') is the 111th episode of the {{series|Diamond & Pearl}}, and the 577th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It aired in Japan on January 22, 2009 and in the United States on June 20, 2009.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/12_07-saving-the-world-from-ruins/-->\n<i>Team Galactic has taken over the Iron Island ruins, where their Spear Key has unleashed a strange energy from the ruins. On top of that, the frequency from their machines has driven the local Steel-type Pokémon berserk! The energy has overwhelmed Riley's Lucario, and Lucario attacks Riley and our heroes. Fortunately, Riley is training to be an Aura Guardian, and he uses his own Aura to shield everyone. At Riley's insistence, Pikachu hits Lucario with a Thunderbolt—Lucario backs off, but then it charges Team Galactic! In the meantime, the energy from the ruins has triggered reactions from distant Mt. Coronet and even the meteorites in Veilstone City, and scientists around the region are scrambling to figure out what's happening.\n\nBack on Iron Island, Commander Mars' Purugly defeats Lucario, but Riley realizes Lucario was trying to destroy Team Galactic's machines. As our heroes run to finish what Lucario started, Piplup falls into the same cavern where Barry and Team Rocket were trapped after their own scrap with Team Galactic. When Dawn tries to help get them out, an angry Steelix knocks her into the cavern! Riley holds Steelix at bay while Ash and Brock finish the mission; as soon as Pikachu destroys Team Galactic's machinery, Steelix and the island's other Steel-type Pokémon calm down.\n\nThis also shuts down the ruins, so Team Galactic beats a quick retreat. As a parting gift, they wire the ruins with enough explosive to blow up Iron Island. Riley and Lucario run to disarm the bombs, but Ash and Brock need to rescue their friends from the cavern. James' Carnivine comes to the rescue: it uses a new move, Vine Whip, to help pull itself to the surface, then pulls up everyone else. As our heroes rejoice, Commander Mars, now a safe distance from the island, hits the detonator for the explosives. The whole island trembles, but remains intact!\n\nRiley and Lucario used their combined powers of Aura to contain the detonating bombs and channel them high above the island to explode harmlessly. With everything quiet for now, Cynthia's grandmother Carolina flies in to examine Team Galactic's handiwork. Both the ruins and Team Galactic's machine are made of the same compound as the Veilstone meteorites; Team Galactic must be using that to locate Spear Pillar, a key to summoning Dialga and Palkia. Riley offers to help Carolina survey the island, but Ash and his friends have other things on their mind. They part on friendly terms with Barry, then get on the ferry. Their destination: Dawn's next Contest and Ash's next Gym battle!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{cleanup|section}}\nContinuing from the [[DP110|last episode]], {{p|Lucario}} is trying to attack {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}}. [[Riley]] blocks it using his [[Aura]] and comments that he and [[Riley's Lucario|his Lucario]] are [[Aura Guardian]]s in training. After Lucario gets shocked by {{AP|Pikachu}}'s {{m|Thunderbolt}}, it runs away to the source of the waves, which is a machine that [[Team Galactic]] had made.\n\nLucario faints after a battle with Mars, so {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} go to help. While jumping over a big hole, {{TP|Dawn|Piplup}} accidentally falls in. {{an|Dawn}} discovers this is the hole where {{an|Barry}} and {{TRT}} are. Dawn tries helping them up from the hole when a Steelix appears, making Dawn fall in as well, and attacks them. Riley goes back to help them, while Ash battles with [[Mars]] and destroys the machine allowing Team Galactic to scan only 60% of [[Mt. Coronet]] in their search for the [[Spear Pillar]]. Mars is defeated, but escapes with the [[Spear Key]] and informs them that she has installed bombs in the ruins, and will blow it up at any second. She then gets off the island in a helicopter. Ash then uses Chimchar to use {{m|Dig}} to help everybody escape the hole, but the ground is too hard, causing it to be recalled. Ash informs every one of this causing James to cry with {{TP|James|Mime Jr.}}. {{TP|James|Carnivine}} watches [[James]] crying and then learns {{m|Vine Whip}}, and uses its new move to help everyone escape the hole.\n\nRiley says that he and Lucario would try something to disarm the bomb and tells the others to run as far as they can. When Riley and Lucario find the bombs, they attempt to take it off, but can't. Mars then detonates the bombs but there is no explosion. Riley and Lucario had used an Aura Bubble to trap an explosion in it. They then send it to the sky and the island is safe. [[Professor Carolina]] arrives and studies the stones Team Galactic had left and asks [[Riley]] to help her study the island's mysterious connection with the [[Veilstone City]] meteorites.\n\nBack at [[Team Galactic]] Headquarters, Mars apologizes to [[Cyrus]] for her failure in destroying Iron Island. Cyrus tells her it's only a temporary setback, and places [[Saturn]] in charge of excavating the [[Spear Pillar]]. Even with only a 60% scan, Team Galactic have still made headway in their search for the Spear Pillar and their quest for the ability to control [[Sinnoh]] space-time will continue.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and {{an|Brock}} succeed in stopping [[Team Galactic]] in their search for the [[Spear Pillar]].\n* [[James's Carnivine]] learns {{m|Vine Whip}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* [[Charon]]\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{an|Barry}}\n* [[Riley]]\n* [[Mars]]\n* [[Cyrus]]\n* [[Saturn]]\n* [[Professor Carolina]]\n* {{tc|Galactic Grunt|Team Galactic Grunts}}\n* {{tc|Scientist}}s\n* [[Jupiter]] (cameo)\n* [[Charon]] (cameo)\n* [[Reggie]] (cameo)\n* [[Yuzo]] (cameo)\n* [[Professor Rowan]] (cameo)\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Piplup}} ({{OP|Dawn|Piplup}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Mime Jr.}} ({{OP|James|Mime Jr.}})\n* {{p|Staravia}} ({{OP|Ash|Staravia}})\n* {{p|Grotle}} ({{OP|Ash|Grotle}})\n* {{p|Chimchar}} ({{OP|Ash|Chimchar}})\n* {{p|Sudowoodo}} ({{OP|Brock|Sudowoodo}})\n* {{p|Croagunk}} ({{OP|Brock|Croagunk}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Yanmega}} ({{OP|Jessie|Yanmega}})\n* {{p|Carnivine}} ({{OP|James|Carnivine}})\n* {{p|Empoleon}} ({{OP|Barry|Empoleon}})\n* {{p|Lucario}} ({{OP|Riley|Lucario}})\n* {{p|Purugly}} ({{OP|Mars|Purugly}})\n* {{p|Staraptor}} ([[Reggie]]'s)\n* {{p|Golbat}} ({{tc|Galactic Grunt|Team Galactic Grunts}}'; multiple)\n* {{p|Magnemite}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Magneton}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Lairon}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Aron}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Geodude}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Skarmory}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Steelix}}\n* {{p|Aggron}}\n* {{p|Kricketot}} (×2; under [[Reggie]]'s care)\n* {{p|Bidoof}} (×3; under [[Reggie]]'s care)\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[Professor Oak's Big Pokémon Examination]]: {{p|Skarmory}}\n* During the title card sequence in the Japanese version, the title card music from the {{series|Advanced Generation}} is played instead of the normal music.\n* Music from ''[[M08|Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]'' and ''[[M09|Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea]]'' is used as background music.\n* The way {{TP|James|Carnivine}} learned {{m|Vine Whip}} is somewhat similar to how {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}} and {{TP|James|Weezing}} evolved.\n* This episode marks the second time in the {{pkmn|anime}} that one of {{TRT}}'s Pokémon is seen learning a new move.\n** The first time was [[James's Cacnea]] in ''[[DP054|Once There Were Greenfields]]''.
