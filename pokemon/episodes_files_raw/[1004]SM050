The Kidnapped {{tt|Hoshigumo|Nebby}}!!\'\') is the 50th episode of the {{series|Sun & Moon}}, and the 989th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on November 16, 2017, in New Zealand on March 1, 2018, and in the United States on March 30, 2018.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/21_07-fabas-revenge/-->\n<i>Lillie can touch Pokémon again! While our heroes celebrate, a disgraced Faba is determined to prove himself to Lusamine by summoning an Ultra Beast—the same one that threatened Lillie years before. He kidnaps Nebby and convinces it to teleport him into his research lab at Aether Paradise.\n\nAsh, Gladion, Lillie, and Lusamine go after Faba, arriving just as a panicked Nebby transforms into a chrysalis and the Ultra Wormhole begins to open! The Ultra Beast known as UB-01 Symbiont emerges and attacks Lillie—but Lusamine throws herself in front of her daughter, and the Ultra Beast engulfs her instead and takes her back through the wormhole!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{an|Lillie}} writes in her diary about the events of the [[SM049|previous episode]]. At [[Aether Paradise]], {{an|Lusamine}} discusses the events that happened in the lab area with [[Wicke]] and [[Professor Burnet]]. They report that no one has found {{an|Faba}} yet. At the [[Pokémon School]], Lillie embraces all of {{ashcl|the group}}\'s Pokémon now that she is able to touch Pokémon again, and enjoys every moment. {{an|Gladion}} arrives at Aether Paradise to see Lusamine and states that they have to find Faba. He refuses to leave it up to the Foundation and leaves in an angered mood. At school, {{an|Professor Kukui}} demonstrates how to jump Rope and {{Ash}} and {{AP|Pikachu}} give it a go. {{DL|Light trio (anime)|Solgaleo|Nebby}} is sleeping with {{AP|Rowlet}} in Ash\'s backpack near the fence, unaware that Faba is watching them. He plans to redeem himself to Lusamine by opening an [[Ultra Wormhole]] but he will need Nebby to do it.\n\nLillie has her turn at jump Rope and is soon joined by everyone\'s Pokémon. Faba manages to lure Nebby out of the backpack with star candy. {{TRT}} are attempting to sell [[Malasada]]s near the school when they spot Faba attempting to catch Nebby. Faba swings his net to catch Nebby only to catch {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} instead. Team Rocket grabs Nebby and, after recalling Wobbuffet, run away. Faba gives chase only for Nebby to {{m|teleport}} them to {{an|Bewear}}, who takes them back into its den. Nebby teleports itself back to the school where Faba decides to use its powers to his advantage. Rowlet draws everyone\'s attention to Nebby\'s disappearance and they spot Nebby teleporting Faba to his research area.\n\nGladion arrives at the school and they fill him in on Faba. They guess that Faba and Nebby are at Aether Paradise so Lillie arranges for [[Hobbes]] to fly them there by plane. Faba prepares the equipment needed to open an Ultra Wormhole before containing Nebby so that it doesn\'t escape and subsequently use its power. Faba activates the device which draws power from Nebby and an Ultra Wormhole begins to open. Arriving at Aether Paradise, Ash, Gladion, and Lillie meet up with Lusamine and head down to the research area. Faba watches the Wormhole open as the others arrive. Ash tries to free Nebby but fails as Faba refuses to close the Wormhole. With help from Pikachu and {{TP|Gladion|Umbreon}}, Nebby is freed, causing the Wormhole to close. Nebby evolves into {{p|Cosmoem}}, which causes the Wormhole to start opening again.\n\nA {{DL|Ultra Beasts (anime)|Nihilego}} emerges from the Wormhole and it makes Faba unconscious. Lusamine sends out her {{p|Clefable}} to attack Nihilego, only for Clefable to be overpowered. All attempts to battle Nihilego fail as Nihilego approaches Lillie. Gladion steps forward to protect her only for Lusamine to step in front of both of them, causing her to be captured by Nihilego. Nihilego and Lusamine retreat through the Ultra Wormhole, which closes behind them.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
