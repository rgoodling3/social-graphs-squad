Swell Up!! Full Battle!!!\'\') is the 142nd episode of the {{series|Sun & Moon}}, and the 1,081st episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on October 6, 2019<!-- and is scheduled to air in the United States on *day*-->.\n{{spoilers}}\n<!--\n==Blurb==\nOfficial Blurb from Pokémon.com goes here, with source link-->\n<!--Please do not alter the blurb to fix any errors, they are meant to be presented as they are on the official site.-->\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[Full Battle]] between {{Ash}} and {{an|Professor Kukui}} continues. {{AP|Lycanroc}} uses {{m|Counter}} to send the oncoming {{m|Rock Slide}} back at {{p|Braviary}}. Kukui turns Braviary\'s descent into a {{m|Sky Drop}}, and it manages to fly Lycanroc into the air despite its jaws clamping down on its talons. Braviary makes an 800 meter ascent before soaring back down at a breakneck pace, slamming Lycanroc into the battlefield below. Despite the heavy impact, Lycanroc returns to its feet and unleashes a {{m|Stone Edge}}. Braviary slices through the sharp boulders with {{m|Steel Wing}} and strikes Lycanroc down with a {{m|Superpower}} attack. Lycanroc stands to its feet, but soon collapses from the blows. [[Hala]] rules Lycanroc out of the match, marking the first defeat of the clash.\n\nAsh decides to make the round an aerial affair as he calls {{AP|Rowlet}}, still donning its {{p|Decidueye}} cloak, onto the field. Rowlet is initially startled by its opponent, though Ash orders it to remain focus and use {{m|Razor Leaf}}. Braviary, however, destroys the attack with a Steel Wing before going on to pursue Rowlet while still maintaining its Steel Wing. Ash retaliates with {{m|Seed Bomb}}, with the [[Everstone]] striking Braviary directly in the face. Braviary recovers again and approaches with Steel Wing. The clash turns into a game of tennis as Braviary deflects some of Rowlet’s Seed Bomb attacks, though it misses others and is struck by the Everstone projectile. Braviary eventually ends the face off, striking Rowlet down with a wack of its Steel Wing. Kukui orders a follow up Superpower, though Rowlet returns with a {{m|Brave Bird}} and sends Braviary hurtling into the battlefield. Kukui is surprised that Braviary is knocked out.\n\nFor his third choice, Kukui calls {{p|Venusaur}} out. Ash orders a Brave Bird, though Venusaur traps Rowlet inside its flower. With its opponent effectively immobilized, Venusaur charges up a powerful {{m|Solar Beam}} for a cataclysmic close-range attack. Rowlet makes a last-ditch escape with {{m|Feather Dance}} and it emerges unscathed. Rowlet puts on its cloak once again before launching into another Brave Bird. Venusaur knocks Rowlet off-course with a {{m|Sludge Bomb}} and uses {{m|Vine Whip}} to batter it into the field to win the round.\n\nAsh decides to go for the [[type]] advantage and calls {{AP|Torracat}} out to face Venusaur. Torracat is reenergized and its bell is swelling with flames from absorbing {{TP|Professor Kukui|Incineroar}}\'s earlier {{m|Blast Burn}} attack. Venusaur ensnares Torracat with its vines, though Torracat\'s counter {{m|Fire Fang}} leaves Venusaur reeling from the burning. Torracat unleashes a {{m|Fire Blast}}, easily scorching through Venusaur\'s Sludge Bombs, to defeat its opponent. Kukui recalls his defeated Venusaur, and Ash decides to switch Torracat out so it can face off against Incineroar later. \n\nKukui selects his powerful {{p|Empoleon}}, adding that it swims around the {{pkmn|world}} to research sea currents. Ash settles with using {{AP|Pikachu}}. He starts things off with an {{m|Electroweb}}, though Empoleon slices through the trap with {{m|Metal Claw}}. Pikachu leaps into action with an {{m|Iron Tail}}, clashing several times with Empoleon’s Metal Claw. Kukui breaks up the {{t|Steel}} [[move]] exchange and has Empoleon approach with {{m|Drill Peck}}. Pikachu blocks the attack with an Electroweb. Empoleon replies with {{m|Whirlpool}}, trapping Pikachu in the water vortex. As Pikachu emerges in a dizzied state, Ash recalls him back from the field and throws {{AP|Melmetal}} into the fray. Empoleon attempts to douse its opponent with a {{m|Hydro Pump}}, though Melmetal spins rapidly to repel the attack. Melmetal fires off a {{m|Flash Cannon}}, knocking Empoleon off balance. Empoleon replies with a Whirlpool, but Melmetal takes it head-on and is not caught in the current. Empoleon shields itself, but is struck out and defeated by Melmetal\'s hefty {{m|Double Iron Bash}} technique. \n\nKukui is pumped by the tough battle so far, and calls out his powerhouse, Incineroar, back onto the field. Starting off with {{m|Darkest Lariat}}, Incineroar manages to repel an oncoming Flash Cannon and land a hit on Melmetal. Ash has Melmetal reply with his own swinging attack, though Incineroar unexpectedly grabs a hold of Melmetal\'s fists. Melmetal rushes in to test its brute strength against Incineroar, with both sides not budging a bit. With Melmetal in close-range, Incineroar engulfs its opponent in a Blast Burn attack. Melmetal succumbs to the intense heat and collapses in defeat. Still anticipating a clash with Torracat, Kukui pulls Incineroar from the field.\n\nKukui, instead, calls his {{p|Lucario}} out as his fifth Pokémon, and Ash replies with {{AP|Naganadel}}. [[Wicke]] is impressed to see an [[Ultra Beast]] sent out onto the battlefield, and {{an|Lusamine}} remarks that they did the right thing in giving Naganadel to Ash. Naganadel is thrilled by the crowd of spectators and spins in excitement. {{DL|Guardian deities (anime)|Tapu Koko}} watches on in anticipation as the round begins with a clash of {{m|X-Scissor}} and {{m|Close Combat}}.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
