It was first broadcast in Japan on August 11, 2005 and in the United States on May 13, 2006.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/08_45-rough-tough-jigglypuff/-->\n<i>On their way to the Battle Arena, Ash and his friends are snagged by a net trap. But for once, it's not Team Rocket—it's a fellow named Mitch and his Loudred, and they're tyring to catch Jigglypuff! Mitch used to be a company executive until his daughter Lisa requested a Jigglypuff for her birthday, and for six months he's been in the woods trying to get one. Every Jigglypuff comes to tease him, and every day Jigglypuff gets away scot free. Plus, Lisa's birthday is tomorrow!\n\nAsh decides to help Mitch out, but Jigglypuff puts everyone to sleep, even Team Rocket. What's more, it's tough, and it's not impressed when they try to lure it with food! So they trick it into battling Loudred and using Rollout, which rolls it right into the cabin—now covered in sound-reflecting panels. Pikachu battles Jigglypuff until it uses Sing, and the echoes of its attack put it to sleep.\n\nNow Mitch can catch Jigglypuff, but he realizes it belongs in the forest after all. He and the kids return to town, where Lisa is happy to have her dad home even if he didn't bring a Jigglypuff. Just then, Jigglypuff comes flying in, angry at Mitch for leaving. It turns out that Jigglypuff liked playing with Mitch, and it decides to stick around. So now Lisa has two new Pokémon friends!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nWhile traveling toward the [[Battle Arena]], {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} are caught in a net and suspended in a tree. They first suspect that this is {{TRT}}'s doing, but {{an|Brock}} thinks it may be something else. A {{p|Loudred}} appears, followed by its {{pkmn|Trainer}}, [[Mitch Mitchum|Mitch]], who apologizes for the mix up. After getting Ash and his friends down and bringing them inside his cabin, he gives them his business card, which describes him as a professional [[Pokéblock]] taster. An intrigued May checks out Mitch's Loudred on her [[Pokédex]]. Mitch makes it up to them by letting their Pokémon try some of his company's Pokéblock, which the Pokémon eat.\n\nAsh asks Mitch why he left the company and who the trap was set for, which he hesitates to answer. Suddenly, the Pokémon—except for {{TP|May|Munchlax}}, who is still eating—sense something coming from the bushes. A {{p|Jigglypuff}} emerges, and Mitch declares that he will handle it, ordering Loudred to use {{m|Mega Punch}}. The blow lands, but Jigglypuff bounces right back into action. Mitch then calls for {{m|Hyper Voice}}, but Loudred is {{DL|Status condition|Infatuation|infatuated}} with Jigglypuff and unable to attack due to Jigglypuff's {{a|Cute Charm}} [[Ability]]. Jigglypuff giggles and unleashes a surprising {{m|Flamethrower}}, followed quickly by {{m|Sing}}, lulling everyone but Loudred to sleep. Jigglypuff laughs and escapes, prompting Loudred to snap out of its infatuation and wake Mitch up, who immediately expresses his anger over failing to capture Jigglypuff yet again.\n\nHigh above in their [[Team Rocket's mechas|balloon]], {{TRT}} notices Jigglypuff's skills and decides to catch it. {{MTR}} [[Boss fantasy|fantasizes]] that {{an|Giovanni}} could use it as a decoration, exercise ball, and sleeping aid.\n\nWhile the Pokémon are used as sentries around the cabin, Ash and friends ask Mitch why he's out here. Mitch explains that he requested leave from his job six months ago to catch his daughter [[Lisa Mitchum|Lisa]] a Jigglypuff for her fifth birthday, which was her only request. He left home to go to the woods in which he knew that Jigglypuff lived. Being an amateur Trainer, Mitch at first simply tried throwing {{i|Poké Ball}} after Poké Ball at one particular Jigglypuff he had found, failing each time. Even after catching his Loudred, whose {{a|Soundproof}} Ability would be useful, the Jigglypuff has continued to outsmart him. Mitch then reveals that Lisa's birthday is tomorrow, but he has already written to her saying that he would not be home for her birthday because he promised to get her a Jigglypuff. Ash and his friends agree to help Mitch capture Jigglypuff. \n\nTeam Rocket is listening in on their conversation using audio equipment while eating rice balls when Jigglypuff shows up next to them. They try to catch it, but Flamethrower makes them toast. They get back up to go after it, but Jigglypuff puts [[Jessie]], [[James]], Meowth, and {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} to sleep. Loudred and {{TP|Brock|Mudkip}} alert Ash, his friends, and Mitch to the scene. Mitch and Ash challenge Jigglypuff to a battle using Loudred and {{AP|Pikachu}}. [[Max]] warns Ash not to attack it directly and Brock suggests to Mitch that he use {{m|Uproar}} to render Sing ineffective. Uproar hits, but Jigglypuff hardly notices it. Pikachu uses {{m|Thunderbolt}}, but Jigglypuff jump high into the air and hits Pikachu twice with {{m|Rollout}}. The third Rollout hits Team Rocket, waking them up and sending Meowth and Wobbuffet into Loudred's ears. Team Rocket recites their {{motto}}, but are interrupted by Mitch, who thinks that they are Ash's friends and hands them his business cards. Loudred blasts the two Pokémon out of its ears, hitting Jessie and James and sending them all blasting off. Jigglypuff escapes, but Brock suggests that outsmarting it might be better than battling it.\n\nThey set out a bowl of Brock's special [[Pokémon food]] as bait, but Jigglypuff does not care for it, to Brock's dismay. May then tries to offer it {{an|Professor Oak}}'s Pink Surprise Pokéblock, but Munchlax swipes it away in a flash. After thinking for a bit, Max figures out a plan to put Jigglypuff to sleep, making it easier to capture. As part of the plan, Mitch lures Jigglypuff into a battle. Loudred's Hyper Voice hits Jigglypuff, at which point Ash says that it can only escape now by using Rollout. Sure enough, it does, and rolls straight towards Loudred, who dodges at the last second. Unable to stop itself, Jigglypuff rolls into the metal cladded cabin. Ash and Brock promptly shut the door behind it. Pikachu appears inside as well and uses Thunderbolt, which reflects many times but still misses. Jigglypuff uses Flamethrower, which also bounces around, hitting neither Pokémon. Jigglypuff bounces off the walls, dodging Thunderbolts until it slams into Pikachu. Both land on the floor, but Jigglypuff begins to Sing. Pikachu drifts off to sleep, but the metal also reflects the musical notes, sending Jigglypuff to sleep too. Ash awakens Pikachu and Brock urges Mitch that now is his chance. However, he realizes that Jigglypuff would be better off living freely in the forest and decides not to catch it. Mitch believes that Loudred would be a good enough present and the group leaves the woods. Jigglypuff wakes up later that night to a full bowl of Pokémon food, but appears saddened.\n\nThe next morning, Mitch arrives at home and greets [[Rikako|his wife]] on the front lawn. Lisa comes out as well, excited to see her father. Lisa is sad at first because she didn't get a Jigglypuff as promised, but is simply thrilled to have her father home again as well as Loudred to play with. From up above, Jigglypuff lands after having traveled while inflated to Mitch's house. It is angry that Mitch stopped chasing it in the woods, but Lisa is overjoyed to see it anyway. Mitch asks Jigglypuff if it would like to stay with his family, which it agrees to. Lisa asks Jigglypuff to Sing with her, but this results in them all falling asleep.\n\n==Major events==\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{an|Giovanni}} ([[Boss fantasy|fantasy]])\n* [[Mitch Mitchum]]\n* [[Lisa Mitchum]]\n* [[Rikako]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:PTC AG138.png|thumb|200px|Pokémon Trainer's Choice]]\n[[Pokémon Trainer's Choice]]: {{p|Ursaring}}\n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Phanpy}} ({{OP|Ash|Phanpy}})\n* {{p|Swellow}} ({{OP|Ash|Swellow}})\n* {{p|Grovyle}} ({{OP|Ash|Grovyle}})\n* {{p|Corphish}} ({{OP|Ash|Corphish}})\n* {{p|Combusken}} ({{OP|May|Combusken}})\n* {{p|Munchlax}} ({{OP|May|Munchlax}})\n* {{p|Squirtle}} ({{OP|May|Squirtle}})\n* {{p|Forretress}} ({{OP|Brock|Forretress}})\n* {{p|Mudkip}} ({{OP|Brock|Mudkip}})\n* {{p|Loudred}} ([[Mitch Mitchum|Mitch]] and [[Lisa Mitchum|Lisa]]'s)\n* {{p|Jigglypuff}} ([[Mitch Mitchum|Mitch]] and [[Lisa Mitchum|Lisa]]'s; new)\n\n==Trivia==\n* The Japanese voices of [[May's Combusken]] and [[Jessie's Dustox]] are both [[Rikako Aikawa]] filling in for [[Chinami Nishimura]].\n* This is the final episode in which [[Brock's Forretress]] is voiced by [[Eric Stuart]] and [[Ash's Swellow]] by [[Darren Dunstan]].\n* This episode marks the second time that the [[narrator]] is affected by {{p|Jigglypuff}}'s {{m|Sing|song}}; the first time was in ''[[EP243|Same Old Song and Dance]]''.\n\n===Errors===\n* When {{Ash}} wants to battle Jigglypuff to help, [[Max]] tells Ash to remember its Cute Charm ''attack''; {{a|Cute Charm}} is actually an [[Ability]].
