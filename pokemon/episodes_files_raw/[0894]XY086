Molteau, the sudden appearance of a fiery Charmeleon lets them know that Trevor, their friend from Pokémon summer camp, is nearby! His goal is to take a photograph of the Legendary Pokémon Moltres, who is reputed to live on Mt. Molteau.\n\nThe Team Rocket villains are close behind, hoping to catch Moltres for the Boss. But first they grab Pikachu and a battle ensues near the volcano’s crater. The Legendary Pokémon awakens during the fray and sends Team Rocket blasting off with a powerful Flamethrower!\n\nUnfortunately, Moltres thinks our heroes are also enemies and turns its attack on them! While trying to protect Ash and his friends, Fletchinder evolves into a magnificent Talonflame. When Talonflame finds itself in trouble, Ash jumps to the rescue, saving his beloved Pokémon and proving to Moltres that he means it no harm.\n\nTrevor has gotten his photograph, our heroes have met Moltres, and Ash and Talonflame vow to work hard together. And now the journey to Anistar City continues!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode opens up with {{Ash}} and {{Ashfr}} arriving at the foot of [[Mt. Molteau]] and speculating that it may be a volcano. Hearing a noise to their right, they notice a {{TP|Trevor|Charmeleon}} stepping out behind some bushes. {{AP|Pikachu}} and {{TP|Clemont|Dedenne}} express their delight and run towards the Charmeleon, only to find Charmeleon retaliating with {{m|Flamethrower}}. The Charmeleon is revealed to be {{an|Trevor}}’s as he arrives and meets the group, only to find himself attacked with Charmeleon\'s Flamethrower too.\n\n{{an|Serena}} asks why Charmeleon is in an awful mood, and Ash suggests maybe Charmeleon wants a battle. Charmeleon agrees and Ash decides to battle with {{AP|Fletchinder}}. Charmeleon begins by attacking with {{m|Fire Spin}}, which Fletchinder dodges. Charmeleon then uses Flamethrower, which Fletchinder deflects with {{m|Steel Wing}}. Fletchinder then hits back with {{m|Flame Charge}}. Charmeleon takes the attack and attacks back with {{m|Dragon Claw}}. Charmeleon then uses Flamethrower, which Fletchinder dodges and uses Steel Wing again, this time knocking Charmeleon out. After the battle, Charmeleon seems to be much calmer than before.\n\nThe group then take a break to eat, and reminisce about their time at the [[Pokémon Summer Camp]]. Bonnie comments Charmeleon’s attitude hasn’t changed since then, and Trevor remarks how Charmeleon has been amazing in battle, earning him the [[Bug Badge]]. Trevor then asks the others whether they also are searching for {{p|Moltres}}, with his analysis having tracked down Moltres to Mt. Molteau. Trevor proceeds to show photos he had taken of {{p|Zapdos}} and {{p|Articuno}}, and continues to ramble on about other photos of other rare Pokémon which leaves the others dumbfounded. Afterwards, Ash and group decide the help Trevor in finding Moltres.\n\nMeanwhile, {{TRT}} are spying on the group, and decide to catch Moltres.\n\nAs the group walk up the mountain, Trevor shows them an obscured photo of Moltres on top of a big rock, exclaiming they also must go find the big rock to find Moltres. Clemont interjects and pulls out his device he calls [[Clemontic Gear|"Rock Searcher Mark 1"]]. Clemont inputs the photo’s landscape into the device’s memory, so that the device can find the same rock. The device shudders and moves towards a rock, which it scans and determines as a wrong match. It continues on moving and finding no correct matches.\n\nLater, Trevor notices a rare {{p|Crustle}} and {{p|Butterfree}} and stops to take photos. Meanwhile, as the group is distracted by Trevor, Team Rocket run past the group and follow Clemont’s device. As Team Rocket locate the device, the device happens to come across a rock of the correct match and rings out a bell. {{an|Jessie}}, frustrated, hits the device which explodes. Team Rocket run away as the group approaches, as Clemont cries over another failed invention. The device then malfunctions and chases the group, eventually falling into the volcano’s lava.\n\nTeam Rocket then interrupts by grabbing and capturing Pikachu in a capsule. Ash takes out Fletchinder while Jessie and {{an|James}} take out {{TP|Jessie|Gourgeist}} and {{TP|James|Inkay}}. Gourgeist attacks with {{m|Shadow Ball}} and Inkay attacks with {{m|Psybeam}} which Fletchinder dodges. Trevor comments on Gourgeist\'s rare {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Pumpkaboo and Gourgeist|size}} and takes photos of it, only to be stopped by Serena. Charmeleon then attacks by using Flamethrower, which is deflected by Inkay’s Psybeam. Gourgeist proceeds to attack with Shadow Ball and Inkay with Psybeam, which Fletchinder again dodges. Jessie and James continue the same attack, which Fletchinder dodges but the attacks hit a boulder, causing it to fall into the lava.\n\nAt this, a roar comes out of the volcano and Moltres appears from the lava. Moltres sets its eyes on Team Rocket which attack Moltres with Shadow Ball and Psybeam. Moltres retaliates with Flamethrower, causing them to blast off, as Pikachu falls out of their grasp. Fletchinder uses Steel Wing on Pikachu’s capsule to release Pikachu.\n\nMoltres now attacks Ash and the group, thinking that they are enemies. Ash takes out {{AP|Frogadier}}, and commands it to use {{m|Water Pulse}}, but the move evaporates before hitting Moltres. Charmeleon then attacks Moltres with Flamethrower. Moltres attacks back at the group with Flamethrower, which Fletchinder dodges. Moltres attacks Fletchinder again, this time hitting Fletchinder and causing it to fall, injured. Moltres then attacks the group, but Fletchinder races to them, and blocks the attack, while evolving into {{AP|Talonflame}} at the same time.\n\nTalonflame attacks Moltres with its newly learned {{m|Brave Bird}}. Moltres continues to retaliate with Flamethrower, and Ash commands Talonflame to attack with Brave Bird again. Moltres uses {{m|Fire Blast}}, which hits Talonflame, causing it to fall, tumbling towards the lava. Ash races and falls down toward the lava to catch Talonflame, his descent just stopped by Frogadier’s frubbles made into a rope.\n\nMoltres observing this decides that they are not enemies and flies off.\n\nAs the group walk down the mountain, Trevor views his photo of Moltres. Ash comments that he and his Pokémon have a lot of things to do, and Trevor decides to take a photo of Ash and his Pokémon.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:XY086 Ash VS Trevor.png|thumb|220px|Ash facing Trevor]]\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
