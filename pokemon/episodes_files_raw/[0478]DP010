To her disappointment, the stores\' Pokétch supply has mysteriously been recalled, but she gets a free Pokétch from Team Rocket. For some reason, Team Rocket are just giving Pokétch away! But a Shinx and its owner, Landis, expose Dawn\'s Pokétch as a fake. Landis should know—he\'s the son of the Pokétch corporation\'s president!\n\nLandis introduces his father to Dawn and her friends, who learn that the Pokétch corporation withdrew its merchandise when it heard that someone was distributing fakes. But Landis\' father does give our heroes a peek at the latest version of the real thing, a Pokétch that measures the Friendship between a Trainer and a Pokémon. As for the fake Pokétch, the truth is soon revealed: Team Rocket is using the fakes to transmit Psyduck\'s voice! Now lots of Pokémon are listlessly walking through the streets in a Psyduck-induced trance, headed right for Team Rocket\'s hideout, and Landis\' Shinx is one of them!\n\nOf course, our heroes must now stop Team Rocket from scooping up all the Pokémon and taking off in their Meowth balloon. Pikachu and Piplup try to stop them, but Team Rocket just adds those two to the collection as well. Dawn isn\'t having any more of this nonsense, so she helps Buneary unleash an amazing Ice Beam that puts the villains\' plans on ice. With the Pokémon freed, Shinx helps charge Pikachu up with electricity and Team Rocket are sent flying once again, without the benefit of a hot air balloon. Now Dawn can receive a real Pokétch of her own, and she\'s just about ready to take on the Jubilife Pokémon Contest!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{ashfr|The group}} arrives in [[Jubilife City]] with three days before the local [[Pokémon Contest]] and {{an|Dawn}}’s long-awaited debut. Dawn is set on getting herself a [[Pokétch]], a must have device for any {{pkmn|Coordinator}}. However, she is disappointed to find the local store is empty. The vendor explains that the [[Pokétch Company]] have recalled all unsold Pokétches. Dawn perks up again when she spots three clowns, actually {{TRT}} [[List of Team Rocket\'s disguises|in disguise]], giving away free Pokétches to the street crowd. Dawn pushes her way through the crowd. Team Rocket are shocked to see her, but give her a Pokétch anyway. They also insist that Ash and Brock take one as well, even though Ash says that he doesn\'t want one.\n\nThe group takes a break in a local park, where Dawn admires her Pokétch. A {{p|Shinx}} then walks up and Ash scans it on his [[Pokédex]], before wondering aloud why it is "barking" so much. Its Trainer, [[Landis]] and instantly reveals the Pokétches are fake. Dawn refuses to believe him, until Landis runs it under water, smearing the paint. When the group asks how he knew they were fake, Landis tells them that [[Pokétch Co. President|his father]] would never make one in such a "dumb" color. \n\nInside the [[Pokétch Company]] factory, Landis\'s father, who is also the Pokétch Co. President, apologizes for his son\'s behavior, but the group insist that it should be the people who made the fakes that should apologize. The President admits that he had the Pokétches pulled from the stores across [[Sinnoh]] because of the counterfeit crisis. Landis then discovers that Dawn is a {{pkmn|Coordinator}}, which prompts his father to show them a prototype Pokétch, which has a [[Friendship]] Checker application. Ash is keen to give the app a try on him and {{AP|Pikachu}}, and the President is surprised by the reading, stating that it is almost off the graph. Brock and {{TP|Brock|Croagunk}} go up next, and despite Croagunk only being a [[DP008|recent addition]], the reading reveals the pair are already quite close. Dawn, however, is shocked to learn that her friendship with {{TP|Dawn|Piplup}} is low. Landis’s father assures her that friendship increases as a Pokémon and {{pkmn|Trainer}} spend time together. Landis recommends Dawn not even both entering the Contest with those low stats. At this, Dawn orders Landis to test his friendship with Shix. Landis retorts that he is too young and still studying at {{si|Trainers\' School}}, much to Dawn\'s dismay. The President and his son wish Dawn all the best with her Contest, with Landis admitting she will need all the luck she can get.\n\nBy nightfall, Team Rocket\'s fake Pokétch goes into full throttle. With the help of a {{p|Psyduck}}, they utilize the fake devices\' speakers to broadcast a hypnotic tone to attract the Trainer\'s Pokémon directly to them. {{AP|Pikachu}} alerts Ash and his friends to the growing Pokémon procession, while Landis and his father abandon their inspection of the fake Pokétch to chase after their hypnotized Shinx. Landis and his father step outside to look for Shinx, but they instead find Ash and his friends. The father and son alert the group to their discovery of the Psyduck recording within the fake Pokétches. Ash and others follow the Pokémon directly to a giant holding container. Oddly the Pokémon just stand in the box, stuck in a trance. Landis rushes forward to rescue his Shinx, but Dawn leaps to his aid to stop the door crashing down on the young boy. Dawn demands to know who is behind the scheme. Team Rocket respond with their {{motto}} before inflating their balloon and firing up their propulsion engines for lift off. Piplup and Pikachu prepare for a {{m|Bubble Beam}} and {{m|Thunderbolt}} combination, but {{MTR}} launches two arms from the balloon, trapping Pikachu and Piplup inside glass capsules. Dawn sends out {{TP|Dawn|Buneary}} and tells it to use {{m|Ice Beam}}, but the Ice Beam can\'t quite reach the balloon’s height. Still determined, Dawn and Buneary close their eyes and take a moment to concentrate. Dawn calls for a maxed out Ice Beam, and the attack freezes Team Rocket. It also shorts out the rocket boosters, stopping them. As the balloon starts to descend slowly, Piplup and Pikachu are released from their capsules and start to fall. Ash sends out {{AP|Starly}}, and has it swoop into to rescue the pair. Starly manages to save Piplup, though Pikachu continues to plummet. Ash runs and dives to try to catch him, but misses and Pikachu hits the ground hard.\n\nAs Ash cradles Pikachu, Team Rocket’s balloon lands and the Pokémon walk out of the damaged container. Brock realizes that the fall must have snapped them out of their hypnosis, and Landis\'s father orders the Pokémon to go back to their Trainers. Team Rocket then break out of the ice and jump to the ground, set on getting revenge. They send out {{TP|Jessie|Seviper}} and {{TP|James|Carnivine}}. Carnivine, of course, {{m|Bite}}s onto James\'s head. Team Rocket then order Seviper and Carnivine to use {{m|Poison Tail}} and Bite respectively. Dawn decides to retaliate, and has Piplup use {{m|Peck}} and Buneary go in for a {{m|Dizzy Punch}}. Seviper and Carnivine are knocked back. Landis\'s father then tells Shinx to use {{m|Spark}} on Pikachu, which recharges Pikachu. Meowth extends his claws and Team Rocket and their Pokémon all jump towards Pikachu. Ash orders a Thunderbolt, which sends Team Rocket blasting off.\n\n[[Officer Jenny]] and [[Nurse Joy]] arrive shortly after, saying that they got there as fast as they could. Brock goes all heart-eyed, and starts to flirt with them, but Croagunk {{m|Poison Jab}}s him and drags him away. Landis then thanks Dawn for saving Shinx. He admits she will do well in the Contest, but says she shouldn’t expect to win much to Dawn\'s annoyance. With the counterfeit crisis solved, Dawn purchases a genuine Pokétch from the store the very next day, Now armed with a Pokétch on her wrist, Dawn turns her attention to her Contest training.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrive in [[Jubilife City]].\n* {{an|Dawn}} obtains a pink [[Pokétch]].\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n=====Main series debuts=====\n* {{jo|Marina}} (advertisement)\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Shinx}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* [[Officer Jenny]]\n* {{jo|Marina}} (cameo; advertisement)\n* [[Landis]]\n* [[Pokétch Co.
