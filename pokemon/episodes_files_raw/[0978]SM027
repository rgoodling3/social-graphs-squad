After hearing about Ash’s Z-Ring and his battles against Tapu Koko, Gladion agrees to meet up the next morning.\n\nThe battle is just getting started, with Ash’s Rockruff against Gladion’s impressive Lycanroc, when Team Rocket swoops in. Gladion and Lycanroc unleash a new Z-Move to send them blasting off again, and Ash is immediately interested in continuing the island challenge so he can get a Rock-type Z-Crystal!\n\nSchool is starting, so the battle is postponed—but it seems Ash has a new rival!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{tc|Team Skull Grunt}}s [[Tupp]], [[Rapp]], and [[Zipp]] are in an alleyway when {{an|Gladion}} walks past along with his {{TP|Gladion|Umbreon}}.
