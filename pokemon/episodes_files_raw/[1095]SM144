It first aired in Japan on October 20, 2019<!-- and is scheduled to air in the United States on *day*-->.\n{{spoilers}}\n<!--\n==Blurb==\nOfficial Blurb from Pokémon.com goes here, with source link-->\n<!--Please do not alter the blurb to fix any errors, they are meant to be presented as they are on the official site.-->\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}}\'s {{wp|exhibition game|exhibition match}} with {{an|Professor Kukui}} continues. {{DL|Guardian deities (anime)|Tapu Koko}}\'s {{a|Electric Surge}} transforms the battlefield with {{m|Electric Terrain}}. {{AP|Naganadel}} uses {{m|Sludge Bomb}}, but Tapu Koko uses {{m|Steel Wing}} to shield itself from the attack and continues to do so when Naganadel uses {{m|X-Scissor}}. Naganadel readies another X-Scissor, but it is hit by Tapu Koko\'s {{m|Dazzling Gleam}}. When Ash orders {{m|Dragon Pulse}}, everyone is shocked by this since Tapu Koko is a {{type|Fairy}} Pokémon and thus immune to {{type|Dragon}} [[move]]s. However, instead of hitting Tapu Koko, the attack goes past it and hits the ground below, stirring a lot of dust, which skews Tapu Koko\'s visibility. Naganadel lands an X-Scissor on its opponent. Tapu Koko charges through a barrage of Sludge Bombs to batter Naganadel with Dazzling Gleam and {{m|Discharge}}, which outruns Naganadel\'s {{m|Thunderbolt}} and defeats the {{an|Ultra Beasts|Ultra Beast}}. Ash takes a moment to thank Naganadel for its assistance before [[recall]]ing it back to its [[Beast Ball]].\n\nAsh calls {{AP|Pikachu}} out as his final Pokémon, and it uses Thunderbolt first. The attack collides with Tapu Koko\'s Dazzling Gleam. Pikachu then uses {{m|Quick Attack}}, but it fails to strike the airborne Tapu Koko. Kukui orders Tapu Koko to retaliate with Dazzling Gleam, but Pikachu leaps out of the way and counters with {{m|Iron Tail}}. Tapu Koko prepares to summon {{m|Nature\'s Madness}}, but Ash calls for an {{m|Electroweb}}, which contains the attack. Tapu Koko is again stunned by the stirred dust, allowing Pikachu to land a clean hit and send it towards the battlefield. Pikachu follows up with Electroweb, pinning Tapu Koko to the ground. Tapu Koko attempts to break its restraints using Discharge, but Pikachu stops it with Thunderbolt, creating a blinding yellow explosion of electricity.\n\nAfter the explosion has cleared up, the Electric Terrain dissipates and Kukui congratulates Ash on how much he\'s grown during the League. Tapu Koko approaches Kukui, pointing at his [[Z-Ring]]. Kukui realizes that Tapu Koko wants to launch a [[Z-Move]], but he explains that it isn’t possible as he already used up his Z-Move with {{TP|Professor Kukui|Incineroar}} earlier. Determined, Tapu Koko breaks out into sing and summons its fellow {{an|guardian deities}} to [[Manalo Stadium]]. The united quartet begin harmonizing together, showering the stadium in glittering scales. Both Ash and Kukui\'s Z-Rings start glowing, signaling that their Z-Power has been recharged. Tapu Koko also offers Kukui a [[Tapunium Z]] [[Z-Crystal|crystal]], previously thought to have been only an ancient myth. Kukui is taken aback, but complies with Tapu Koko\'s wishes. He calls out to Ash and orders him to launch his Z-Move at the same time, which Ash happily agrees to. Kukui performs the Z-Pose pose perfectly, passing on the ancient power to Tapu Koko. The ground trembles and the field fractures as a yellow headless giant emerges from underground, shocking everyone watching.\n\nEveryone in the stadium is startled by the sheer gargantuan Ash has to now face. Ash\'s attention, however, quickly turns to his [[Z-Power Ring]] as it begins sparking, his [[Electrium Z]] suddenly transforming into a [[Pikashunium Z]]. Ash promptly puts his {{AP|hat}} on Pikachu\'s head and prepares his own full power Z-Move. Tapu Koko takes its position as the head of the titan as Kukui orders it to attack with {{m|Guardian of Alola}}. Pikachu unleashes {{m|10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt}}, and the two signature Z-Moves clash. Ash and Pikachu briefly find themselves in a white void, where Ash tells Pikachu how they had felt the power of [[Alola]] throughout their travels across the [[region]], and now it was time to become one with that power. With extreme effort, Pikachu\'s Z-Move finally overpowers Guardian of Alola, enveloping Tapu Koko in a bright burst of energy. The blinding collision clears, with Ash and Pikachu visibly exhausted by the combined effort. Tapu Koko begins to descend gently before collapsing onto the debris-littered field. [[Hala]] makes the official judgment, ruling Tapu Koko unable to battle and proclaiming Ash as the winner of the exhibition match. Ash finally collapses from both exhaustion and relief, while the crowd erupts into cheers and applause, and {{ashcl|Ash\'s classmates}} are overjoyed.\n\nWhile Ash fully realizes he just won, {{DL|Guardian deities (anime)|Tapu Lele}} showers the battlefield in its sparkling scales, helping both Pikachu and Tapu Koko to recover from the exhausting battle. Kukui leaps forward and thanks Tapu Koko for its help with a handshake. Pikachu and Ash also thank their formidable opponents for the spectacular match. With the [[Manalo Conference]] now officially completed, Professor Kukui takes a moment to gaze over the crowd and he declares the League a success. Ash agrees, earning himself a pat on the head from his mentor. Kukui warns Ash not to get too overconfident from his victory, and the young Trainer accepts the advice.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
