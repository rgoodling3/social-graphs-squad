Pokévision Showdown!!\'\') is the 40th episode of the {{series|XY}}, and the 839th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on August 21, 2014 and in the United States on October 18, 2014.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/17_39-day-three-blockbusters/-->\n<i>On the third day of Professor Sycamore\'s Pokémon summer camp, all the teams get to make their own Pokévision video! Pokévision fans Serena and Shauna are extra excited, and Shauna tells Serena all about the famous Aria\'s latest Pokévision video and her performance at the Pokémon Showcase, where Pokémon performers show off their partnership in style!\n\nWhile scouting for a good shooting location, Serena and Ash tumble into a ravine! Ash twists his ankle, and while Professor Sycamore organizes a rescue party, Ash and Serena have time to talk about finding their dreams…even if Serena isn\'t quite sure what hers is yet.\n\nAfter the rescue, Serena directs the rest of Team Froakie in shooting their video. When the campers vote for their favorite at a screening, our heroes come out on top! Our heroes are now tied for the most points with their new friends in Team Squirtle, as their summer camp journey continues.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAs the [[Pokémon Summer Camp]] continues, {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} are all doing a morning jog, and {{an|Clemont}} falls behind substantially. Later, Ash, his friends, {{an|Shauna}}, {{an|Tierno}}, and {{an|Trevor}} all participate in a [[fishing]] competition, where they all fish for {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. Though they all fish out many Pokémon, Trevor gives Team Squirtle the win by fishing out a {{p|Wailord}}, the largest capture of them all, in stark contrast to the mere {{p|Magikarp}} and {{p|Tentacool}} that Tierno and Shauna reeled out.\n\nAs the fishing competition ends, everyone from the camp gathers around in a room as {{an|Professor Sycamore}} introduces the major activity of the day: a [[Pokévision]] showdown. He declares that each team must make a Pokévision video, and that the team with the best Pokévision video wins for the day. Later on, Team Froakie returns to their cabin. {{an|Serena}} reveals to the group her plans for the Pokévision video, which she maps out through drawings. Ash and his friends all agree to the plan.\n\nSerena and {{an|Bonnie}} then begin preparing [[Poké Puff]]s at the main hall, along with Shauna. As they do so, Shauna asks Serena if she has seen Aria\'s newest Pokévision video and mentions that Aria\'s popularity increased after she became a [[Pokémon Performer]]. This leaves Serena and Bonnie confused as they do not know what a Perfomer is. Shauna then explains that a Pokémon Performer participates in competitions called [[Pokémon Showcase]]s. They participate in a first round known as Theme Performance where they perform activities such as making Poké Puffs, grooming Pokémon, and performing with props, depending on the specific competition. After that, they compete in a Freestyle Performance where the Performers combine their skills with their Pokémon\'s moves. This becomes appealing to Serena and Bonnie as they are intrigued by this kind of idea. Shauna then goes on to explain that after winning three Showcases, a Performer heads onto the Master Class, and after winning there, they are awarded the title of {{DL|Pokémon Performer|Kalos Queen}}. She then states that {{an|Aria}} is currently the Kalos Queen. It is also revealed that Aria\'s {{p|Fennekin}} is now a {{TP|Aria|Braixen}}.\n\nLater on, Ash and his friends begin their Pokévision, and on the beach Team Squirtle begins their own. Serena begins running to an intriguing location to start the video, but she falls off the cliff. Ash quickly tries to save her, but also ends up falling with her. They both fall face down into the base of the cliff, while Clemont and Bonnie go seek help.\n\nAsh and Serena are then alone down in the cliff. Ash has injured his foot by this time, but Serena helps nurse it with a wet cloth. The two then have a personal conversation. Ash talks about his own dream, which is to become a [[Pokémon Master]], and says that Serena should take her time to find her own goal. Serena remarks on how amazing Ash is, to his own surprise. Later, they express their bonds with their respective [[starter Pokémon]]. Soon enough, Professor Sycamore arrives with Clemont, Bonnie, and Team Squirtle, along with {{TRT}} in disguise, who show up as rescue workers. They show up with ropes and help Ash and Serena get up the cliff. Team Froakie then finds a large plain, ideal for making the Pokévision video. They proceed to record the video there.\n\nAt nighttime, all of the teams have finished recording their videos and are in the main hall to watch all of them. Team Squirtle has a video showing off each of their respective Pokémon. Later, many other Pokévisions are shown and everyone watches. Shauna and Serena then go outside to the docks to have a personal conversation. Motivated by the events earlier on in the day, Serena reveals that she wants to go watch a Pokémon Showcase and see what a Performer does, and Shauna decides to go together with her.\n\nLater, the votes roll in. Team Froakie has won the competition in first place, with Team Chikorita and Team Charmander in second and third place, respectively. The groups then go on to continue their Summer Camp experience.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

However, this is incorrect on both counts. On {{an|Professor Sycamore}}\'s points screen early in the episode, after the first activity with points awarded Team Squirtle has 10 points, Team Chikorita has seven points, and Teams Froakie and Charmander, which must have tied in the fishing competition, each have three points. For the Pokévision activity Team Froakie gains 10 points, Team Chikorita gains seven points, Team Charmander gains three points, and Team Squirtle gains zero points. This would bring the totals at the end of the episode to 14 points for team Chikorita, putting them in the lead, 13 points for Team Froakie, and 10 points for Team Squirtle (with six points for Team Charmander, putting them in fourth place).\n<gallery>\nFile:XY040 error.png|Furfrou\'s trims colors errors\nFile:XY040 error 2.png|Jessie with lipstick while still in disguise as a cook\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=F16A81|bordercolor=025DA6\n|zh_cmn={{tt|莎莉娜VS莎娜！神奇寶貝短片對決！！|Shauna VS Serena!
