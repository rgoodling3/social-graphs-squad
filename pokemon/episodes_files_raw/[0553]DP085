Wings of Friendship!\'\') is the 85th episode of the {{series|Diamond & Pearl}}, and the 551st episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan, as part of a one-hour special along with [[DP084]], on July 3, 2008, and in the United States on December 13, 2008.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/11_33-fighting-fear-with-fear/-->\n<i>As Ash heads back to Hearthome City for his long-delayed Gym battle, he\'s concerned about his own Gligar\'s battle woes. Even though Ash gives Gligar lots of special training, it just can\'t get its act together. Gligar finally gives up and flies away, only to run into Gary Oak. Gary offers to help with Gligar\'s problem, starting by having a friendly battle between Gligar and Gary\'s Umbreon. Once the battle starts, Gligar panics, and Gary realizes what the problem is: Gligar is overcome by fear whenever it tries to fight.\n\nGary thinks Gligar should use a Razor Fang to evolve into Gliscor, and Gary just happens to have a Razor Fang he can give to Ash. Once Gligar is a powerful Gliscor, its fear will be a thing of the past! Gligar loves this idea, but Ash says no; he wants Gligar to conquer its fear before it evolves. Poor Gligar gets another shock when Team Rocket springs an ambush with their giant Gliscorbot, snatching Gligar and making a getaway. Ash manages to leap onto the Gliscorbot before it escapes, but that just means Ash and Gligar end up stuck in the same cage!\n\nWhile Team Rocket celebrates their catch by eating themselves into a stupor, Ash coaches Gligar to break them out of the cage with X-Scissor. With Gligar\'s help, the two of them then escape across a chasm, and Gligar\'s confidence begins to build. Just in time, too, because Team Rocket has caught up with their escaped captives! Ash tosses Gligar the Razor Fang and it evolves just in time to save them both from Team Rocket\'s clutches. In fact, by the time Gary and the others catch up to Ash, Gliscor has Team Rocket pretty well beat! Gary says his farewells and our heroes get back on the road to Hearthome City, now accompanied by a confident new Gliscor!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{cleanup|section}}\n{{Ash}}, {{an|Dawn}} and {{an|Brock}} begin eating. As they do, Brock seems happy at how well the group of Pokémon are getting along and how they seem to be enjoying the food. On ground level, {{TP|Dawn|Swinub}} starts to take too much of a liking to {{TP|Dawn|Piplup}}\'s food portion but is stopped by the no-nonsense penguin who pushes it back. {{AP|Turtwig}} gets between the two bickering Pokémon and stops the fight before it starts, while Ash and Dawn laugh at the squabbling duo. Ash then realizes that {{p|Gligar}} is nowhere to be found, and gets up and starts to look around for the missing Pokémon. Ash calls out its name, and is replied instantly by an affectionate Gligar who drops down from the sky and lands straight on top of Ash, slamming him to the ground. Ash wonders where Gligar went to, and Gligar starts to use {{m|X-Scissor}} to show Ash that it has been training. Ash is impressed, and Brock wonders if maybe it\'s trying harder to get stronger after [[DP081|being defeated]] by [[Paul]]\'s {{p|Gliscor}}. Dawn tells Brock to hush as he\'s hurting Gligar\'s feelings, and Ash comforts the upset Pokémon by telling it that they\'ll do some training together soon.\n\nAfter the group finish their meal, a practice battle between Gligar and {{AP|Buizel}} is set up so Gligar can practice some of its moves. Gligar seems confident, before Buizel starts to look at it with an evil smirk. Gligar\'s confidence starts to waver, but Ash tells it that everything will be fine and that a battle like this is just what it needs. Gligar is satisfied by this, and Ash starts the battle off by telling Gligar to use X-Scissor. Gligar tries hitting Buizel with the attack, but the Sea Weasel proves too fast for it and keeps dodging every attack. Ash then tells Buizel to use {{m|Aqua Jet}}, which it does jumping into the air and speeding towards Gligar with a high powered water attack. Gligar falls to the ground and starts crying, before jumping into Ash\'s arms and clinging to his head. Buizel continues its attack and smashes straight into Ash, who is far from impressed. Ash irritatedly asks Gligar what\'s wrong with it, causing Gligar to get discouraged. Dawn tells Ash that he\'s going about it the wrong way and kneels down to Gligar\'s level. She then starts comforting it by stroking it and gives it a hug, which makes Gligar blush and stop crying. Ash says that he doesn\'t want Gligar to get spoiled from being treated that way, but Brock notes that being so harsh on it won\'t get him anywhere, either.\n\n[[File:Ash scolding Gligar.png|thumb|220px|Ash scolding Gligar]]\nAsh then calls out Turtwig to battle against Gligar instead. Ash tells Turtwig to use {{m|Energy Ball}}, which Gligar manages to dodge but only because it\'s trying to run away. As it flies into the air, Ash tells Gligar to use {{m|Steel Wing}}, which it does, but falters when Turtwig stares at it ferociously, ready to defend. Gligar then spins around and starts chasing after Ash, who starts to run away. Gligar swoops down, knocking over Ash again with its weight. Ash starts to scold the Pokémon, saying that it\'s going to have to start toughening up and stop crying. Gligar takes it a little too harshly, and it flies away sobbing. Watching all of this happen is {{TRT}} who are hiding in the bushes nearby. [[James]] thinks that this is the perfect chance to steal Gligar, who will now be alone and defenseless. {{MTR}} explains that they could capture Gligar and send it to {{an|Giovanni|the Boss}}, who could use it to shield his eyes in the morning when the sun peeks in through the window. [[Jessie]] thinks this is a great idea, and the three celebrate at their latest plan.\n\nMeanwhile, Ash, Dawn, and Brock are calling out for the missing Gligar to no avail. {{AP|Staravia}} then flies onto the scene, and Ash asks if the bird Pokémon has seen Gligar. Staravia nods, and the gang follow it to a forest clearing, where they find Gligar along with a familiar face: Ash\'s old [[rival]] turned {{pkmn|Professor|Pokémon Researcher}}, [[Gary Oak]]. The two greet each other, and Dawn is instantly awe-struck by seeing {{an|Professor Oak|the poetry guy}}\'s grandson again. Ash asks Gary what he\'s doing here, and he explains that he was on his way to [[Lake Valor]] to check out the [[Legendary_Pokémon|Legendary]] [[Lake_guardians_(anime)#Azelf|Pokémon]] that Ash and his friends saw [[DP078|earlier]], because [[Professor Rowan]] asked that he do so. Gary asks about Gligar, to which Ash replies that it is his. Gary makes a guess that they were in the middle of training when it ran off, to which Ash is surprised that he knew. Gary smirks playfully at Ash and suggests that his training methods aren\'t working. Ash takes the bait and gets offended by his assumption, to which Gary clarifies that he was only offering to help him. Ash refuses his offer and tries to call Gligar back to him, but Gligar recoils in fright and hides behind Gary. Ash then grabs ahold of Gligar, trying to pull it away, but Gligar refuses to budge and continues to hide in fear. Dawn suggests to Ash that maybe he should let Gary help him with Gligar\'s training. Brock agrees, and says that he should do it for Gligar\'s sake, and that it would be best for everyone. Gary agrees, and Ash grits his teeth in frustration. \n\nNot soon after, the two begin a battle to try to figure out why Gligar is having problems training. Gary sends out {{TP|Gary|Umbreon}} against Ash\'s Gligar, and Ash starts the battle off by telling Gligar to use Steel Wing, which is followed by Gary who tells Umbreon to use its {{m|Shadow Ball}}. The attack misses Gligar, but the scared Pokémon recoils in fear anyway, and it falls back down and lands on Ash. Gary takes note that Gligar easily gets frightened when facing an opponent. Brock adds that even though Gligar wants to get stronger, it can\'t because of its fear of battling. Gary says that the first step they have to take is to try and overcome that fear, and Dawn asks how they can do that. Ash pipes up and says that you just have to focus and concentrate, to which Gary quickly shuts him down, saying that he\'ll never change. He then says that to use Steel Wing effectively, the Pokémon using it needs to jump up in the air as high as possible beforehand, and if they can work on that then Gligar\'s confidence would surely return. Dawn is amazed by how Gary explained it, and remarks that he\'s much better at giving instructions than Ash is, to which Ash takes offense. Taking in some of the conversation between the group, Gligar starts warming up to the battle by bouncing on its tail like a spring, before jumping up to fly. However, once in the air, Gligar becomes scared at how high it is and falls back down to the ground, landing on Ash again.\n\nAt that, Gary says that they\'ve definitely got a problem on their hands if Gligar is afraid of heights, too. He then asks how much battling Gligar has actually done, and Dawn explains to him that it\'s not very much, as Gligar got beaten pretty badly by Paul\'s Gliscor. She adds that maybe that\'s the reason why Gligar is so scared to battle now. Gary thinks on it for a moment, and then has an idea that he says may help Gligar, and pulls out a [[Razor Fang]] from his pocket. He hands it to Ash, telling him the Razor Fang will make Gligar [[Evolution|evolve]] into Gliscor, and if they evolve it, it\'ll feel a lot better about its abilities. Gligar excitedly tries to grab the item from Ash\'s hand but Ash stops it, pulling his hand away from the over-eager Pokémon. He tells it that evolution is no substitute for hard work, and that it can evolve after it conquers its fear. Suddenly, a large noise is heard from nearby and Team Rocket emerge from the trees in a [[Team_Rocket%27s_mechas|Gliscor-shaped balloon]]. The team then recite their usual motto, followed up by {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} who pops out of its Poké Ball as usual. Gary isn\'t impressed to see Team Rocket again, who he regards as lame, which annoys the trio to no end. In retaliation to those words, they release the spike of the Gliscor balloon which shoots out and grabs onto Gligar, pulling it in. Ash runs after it and jumps onto the tail, being pulled towards the balloon along with it, much to Team Rocket\'s annoyance. Ash then calls out Staravia, which is followed by Jessie sending out {{TP|Jessie|Seviper}} to use {{m|Haze}} and {{TP|Jessie|Yanmega}} to use {{m|Silver Wind}}. Seviper appears out of its Poké Ball and releases a dark smoke which blinds Staravia and the others, and it\'s followed up by Yanmega using its Silver Wind to send it plummeting down to the ground.\n\n[[File:DP085_Gliscor_Bot.png|thumb|left|220px|Team Rocket\'s Gliscor Bot]]\nSoon after, we find Ash and Gligar trapped in a cage with Team Rocket standing nearby their balloon, celebrating their victory. Jessie plans to send for Team Rocket\'s {{OBP|Delibird|Team Rocket}} to come pick up Gligar and take it straight to the boss. The three then dig into a large pile of tinned fruit in celebration. While all this is happening, Gary, Dawn and Brock are busy searching for Ash, with Staravia flying above them keeping lookout as the sun sets. Dawn takes note that it\'s getting dark and they still haven\'t found Ash and his Pokémon yet. Gary replies that he knows this area like the back of his hand, and there aren\'t that many places where Team Rocket\'s balloon could have landed. He begins to lead the way and the others follow right behind him.\n\nLater that night, Team Rocket are sound asleep, which Ash tells Gligar is their chance to escape. Gligar nods, and Ash tells it to use X-Scissor to break open the bars on the cage. Gligar does so, but the attack isn\'t strong enough, so Ash tells it to use it again but this time with as much power as possible. Gligar fails again however, and its claw starts to glow red with pain. Ash tells it not to worry, and starts to smash into the cage bars himself. Gligar watches this in amazement. Gligar then resolves to try as hard as possible to get out of the cage and starts to use X-Scissor again. This time Ash notices a change in the strength of the bar, as it appears wobbly at the top. At this, Ash tells Gligar that they need to work together to get out, and they both attack the cage bars at the same time, which breaks them open. The two then escape from the clearing where Team Rocket had landed and head out on their way back to the gang. On the way they come across an old, rickety bridge, and Gligar jumps on Ash\'s back as they try to get across it. The wind makes this difficult, as well as the various holes in the bridge which Ash jumps between. The bridge then falls apart, sending Ash and Gligar falling, but Ash manages to grab a hold of the rope holding the bridge together and merely swings and hits the rock facing.\n\nBack at Team Rocket\'s camp, James wakes up from a peaceful sleep and is horrified to find Ash and Gligar gone. He then tries to wake up Jessie and Meowth. Back with Ash, we find that he and Gligar have managed to climb their way back up to the top of the cliff. Ash looks around for a way to cross the chasm, and notices a tree near the edge of the cliff not far from where the bridge used to stand. He tells Gligar to try to knock it over, which it tries to but fails. Ash asks Gligar if it\'s okay, but Gligar simply gets back up and tries again, jumping into the air and smashing into the tree again. This time, Gligar finally succeeds and the tree falls, forming as a bridge between the two cliff edges. Ash is proud of Gligar, and tells it that it\'s earned the Razor Fang that Gary gave him before. Gligar is overwhelmed with happiness and hugs Ash, but the happy moment is interrupted by Team Rocket who appear in their Gliscor balloon. Ash tells them to leave them alone, but is ignored as Team Rocket is set on stealing Gligar for Giovanni. The Gliscor tail shoots out again, but Ash jumps in the way of it and is captured instead. Holding Gligar in his arms, he tells it that he\'s going to let it go so it can escape. He then does so, and Gligar falls down below. Ash then falls himself, and falls past Gligar due to being less air-resistant. Gligar notices Ash falling below and dives after him to grab him, but isn\'t fast enough. Ash throws Gligar the Razor Fang, which Gligar catches, causing it to instantly evolve into {{AP|Gliscor}}. Ash smiles at seeing his Pokémon evolve, but then remembers he\'s falling and starts to scream uncontrollably. However Gliscor is now a lot faster than before and manages to catch Ash, using its tail to cushion the blow to the ground. Ash thanks his new Gliscor for saving him. Team Rocket then float down from above, and the team seem confident that they can still capture Gligar in its evolved state.\n\nAsh tells Team Rocket that Gliscor belongs to him and isn\'t going anywhere with them, and then has Gliscor to use X-Scissor, which smashes into the Gliscor balloon tail and knocks it back. At this, Gary, Dawn and Brock run onto the scene and call out to Ash. Dawn is amazed to see that Gligar has evolved, and Brock congratulates it for doing so. Team Rocket then shout out to the group below angry at being ignored, and Meowth sends out the claws of the Gliscor balloon mecha. This is deflected once again by the real Gliscor\'s X-Scissor attack. Ash then tells it to grab a hold of a tree branch and charge up its power, which it does, before flinging itself of the tree and using Steel Wing aimed at Team Rocket. James smirks, saying that Gliscor can\'t beat their mecha balloon\'s power. Meowth then activates the balloon\'s Steel Wing mode, which emulates the real Pokémon\'s attack. The two \'Gliscor\' face off, both hitting each other at the same time. Ash\'s Gliscor wins out, and Team Rocket\'s splits into two halves and falls down to the ground. Meowth gloomily remarks that they won\'t have a Pokémon to give to Giovanni after all, but Jessie screams at it to help them get the mecha back together again. Ash then tells {{AP|Pikachu}} to use {{m|Thunderbolt}}, which causes the Gliscor balloon to explode and sending Team Rocket blasting off again. The group are relieved to have sent Team Rocket packing, and the sun then rises as if to agree with them. Ash and Gliscor watch the sunrise and give each other a smile, the rift between them healed and with a stronger bond than before.\n\nSoon after, we find Ash, Dawn and Brock saying their goodbyes to Gary. The young researcher seems impressed with Ash, and Ash thanks Gary for the help he has given them, including giving him the Razor Fang earlier. Gary humbly says that he didn\'t do anything, and Ash was the one who really saved the day, not him. Brock says to Gary that he hopes he can see that Legendary Pokémon at Lake Valor. Gary casually replies, but accidentally rhymes his sentence in the process, causing Dawn to suddenly freak out. When asked what\'s wrong, she says that what Gary just said sounded just like a poem, but that\'s to be expected when he\'s the grandson of a poet. Everybody seems embarrassed by this, but Gary only chuckles and follows it up with another poem, which makes Dawn happy. After that, Gary bids the group farewell, wishing everyone good luck in their goals. They then wave goodbye to him, before heading out on the road to their next adventure.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} meet up with {{Gary}} again.\n* Gary gives Ash a [[Razor Fang]].\n* Ash\'s {{p|Gligar}} perfects {{m|X-Scissor}}.\n* Ash uses the Razor Fang to [[Evolution|evolve]] his Gligar into a {{AP|Gliscor}}.\n* [[Jessie\'s Yanmega]] is revealed to know {{m|Silver Wind}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* [[Ash\'s Gliscor]]\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{an|Giovanni}} ([[Boss fantasy|fantasy]])\n* [[Gary Oak]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Piplup}} ({{OP|Dawn|Piplup}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Staravia}} ({{OP|Ash|Staravia}})\n* {{p|Turtwig}} ({{OP|Ash|Turtwig}})\n* {{p|Chimchar}} ({{OP|Ash|Chimchar}})\n* {{p|Buizel}} ({{OP|Ash|Buizel}})\n* {{p|Gligar}} ({{OP|Ash|Gligar}}; evolves)\n* {{p|Gliscor}} ({{OP|Ash|Gliscor}}; newly evolved)\n* {{p|Buneary}} ({{OP|Dawn|Buneary}})\n* {{p|Pachirisu}} ({{OP|Dawn|Pachirisu}})\n* {{p|Ambipom}} ({{OP|Dawn|Ambipom}})\n* {{p|Swinub}} ({{OP|Dawn|Swinub}})\n* {{p|Sudowoodo}} ({{OP|Brock|Sudowoodo}})\n* {{p|Croagunk}} ({{OP|Brock|Croagunk}})\n* {{p|Happiny}} ({{OP|Brock|Happiny}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Yanmega}} ({{OP|Jessie|Yanmega}})\n* {{p|Umbreon}} ({{OP|Gary|Umbreon}})\n* {{p|Gliscor}} ([[Paul]]\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Azelf}} ({{DL|Lake guardians (anime)|Azelf|anime}}; flashback)\n\n==Trivia==\n* Instead of [[Professor Oak\'s Pokémon Lecture]], the end of this episode featured a special trailer for \'\'[[M11|Giratina and the Sky Warrior]]\'\'.\n* Music from \'\'[[M08|Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]\'\' and \'\'[[M09|Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea]]\'\' is used as background music.\n* {{an|Dawn}} narrates the preview for [[DP086|the next episode]].\n* During the {{series|Diamond & Pearl}}, {{Ash}}, Dawn, and {{an|Brock}} each have owned a {{cat|Generation II Pokémon}}; however, this episode (before {{AP|Gligar}} [[Evolution|evolved]]) and the previous episode (after {{TP|Dawn|Swinub}} was {{pkmn2|caught}}) are the only times in the series in which all three have a Generation II Pokémon with them: Ash has Gligar, Dawn has Swinub, and Brock has {{TP|Brock|Sudowoodo}}.\n* This is the second time that {{Gary}} appears in [[Sinnoh]], the first time being exactly [[DP045|40 episodes ago]].
