It was first broadcast in Japan on March 23, 2000 and in the United States on February 24, 2001. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/03_35-wired-for-battle/-->\n<i>When the most promising trainee at a Pokémon dojo abandons battle altogether, opting to gather information for his comprehensive Poké-database instead, it\'s up to Ash and friends to convince him that battling, and life for that matter, is more than just a matter of probability.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAs {{TRT}} is discussing their plan to steal {{AP|Pikachu}}, they are interrupted by a man who asks them if they are looking for a {{pkmn|battle}}. They accept but are defeated easily. Later, {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} are confronted by the same man and his {{p|Scizor}}. When {{an|Misty}} is infuriated at him for letting his Pokémon run loose and attack at will, the man explains that they were trying to do some secret training. He apologizes and introduces himself to Ash as [[Muramasa]]. He then introduces Scizor, who he calls Masamune. Muramasa admits that he is impressed by Ash and his Pikachu before inviting the group over to his elite training school.\n\nAs they tour around Muramasa\'s training school, Ash and his friends learn from a student that Muramasa is a talented Trainer and his Scizor is also known as "The Crimson Streak" because of its incredible speed and strength. Ash comments that "The Crimson Streak" is a cool [[nickname]] when another Trainer makes an abrupt entrance. Muramasa introduces his top student [[Shingo]], and at his request, Ash challenges Shingo. However, Shingo sits down, opens a laptop, and begins scrolling through a database entry for Ash. He explains that it contains everything he ever needs to know about any Trainer. When an eavesdropping Team Rocket hears this, they decide to steal the laptop.\n\nShingo finds Ash\'s entry and comments that he was lucky to get into the top 16 of the [[Indigo Plateau Conference]]. Ash argues that he is much better in skill now and insists on having a battle to prove himself. Shingo refuses, reasoning that Ash would lose according to his data. Despite Ash\'s continued insistence, Shingo tells Muramasa to find an opponent that can teach him something he doesn\'t already know, and leaves. Muramasa later tells Ash and his friends that Shingo hasn\'t battled in over a year because he believes he can predict any battle outcome with his laptop. He then shares his concern that Shingo has lost his way. Since Shingo needs a battle that would show him that there is more to Pokémon than just facts and figures, Ash declares that he will battle Shingo.\n\nLater, Ash drags Shingo away from his laptop, allowing Team Rocket to move in. {{MTR}} plugs a cable into Shingo\'s laptop so that [[James]] can begin downloading the data. However, [[Jessie]] grabs the cable and tries to pull in the whole laptop. Just then, they are confronted by Masamune, prompting them to send out their Pokémon. As Shingo grabs his laptop, Team Rocket performs their {{motto}}. Shingo promptly looks the trio on his database and finds that they are not listed. When Team Rocket insults the database, an infuriated Shingo releases his own Scizor, "Blade", which has never been defeated in battle. Shingo sits down with his laptop, with its webcam focused on Team Rocket and their Pokémon so he can record the match. After analyzing Team Rocket\'s Pokémon as they approach, Shingo has Blade use {{m|Quick Attack}}, which defeats all of Team Rocket\'s Pokémon in one move and sends them blasting off. When Ash explains to Shingo that there is more to battling than just winning, Shingo agrees to battle him.\n\nMuramasa takes his position as [[Battle judge|referee]], and declares that the match will be a one-on-one battle. Shingo chooses Blade and Ash calls on his {{AP|Heracross}}. Shingo starts with a Quick Attack and Ash tells Heracross to use {{m|Leer}}. Leer doesn\'t have enough time to work and Heracross is hit. Heracross gets back up, but Shingo tells Blade to use {{m|Metal Claw}}. Blade picks up Heracross by the horn, and at Ash\'s request, Heracross uses its weight to land safely on its feet. Heracross replies with a {{m|Horn Attack}}, which grazes Blade, much to Shingo\'s surprise. While Shingo does some research, Heracross then uses {{m|Take Down}}, but Blade evades with {{m|Agility}}. Heracross soon finds itself surrounded by Blade and becomes confused. Ash tells Heracross to relax and let Blade approach. Shingo starts to panic as he cannot look at his laptop and the battlefield at the same time. At that moment, Ash tells Heracross to use {{m|Fury Attack}}. Heracross goes berserk, and Blade tries to use Metal Claw, but Heracross is too fast and knocks Blade down.\n\nBlade stands up and Heracross uses Fury Attack again. Shingo promptly gets up and fully concentrates on the battle. He tells Blade to use Quick Attack, while Heracross uses {{m|Tackle}}; both Pokémon miss. Heracross dodges Blade\'s Metal Claw again, and Blade becomes stuck on Heracross\'s horn. Blade uses Agility to get away, and dives in for a {{m|False Swipe}}. Ash tells Heracross to stand its ground. While the powerful attack hits, it proves to be ineffective against Heracross\'s hard shell. Heracross replies with a Horn Attack, which tosses Blade to the ground and gives Ash the victory. Shingo rushes to Blade\'s side, and Muramasa is surprised to see that he has abandoned his laptop. Shingo assures Blade that it battled well. Ash thanks Shingo and they agree to battle again in the future.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

In addition, Weezing and Victreebel are [[James]]\'s Pokémon.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[Pokémon Karaokémon]]: [[All We Wanna Do]]\n* In the original version, Muramasa is Shingo\'s father, but he is Shingo\'s teacher in the dub.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|bg={{tt|Предизвикателство за битка!|Challenge to battle!}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|巨鉗螳螂對抗赫拉剋羅斯|Scizor vs. Heracross}}\n|cs={{tt|Počítačový zápas|Computer battle}}\n|nl={{tt|Aangesloten voor een Gevecht!|Connected for  a Battle!}}\n|de={{tt|Verkabelter Pokémon-Kampf|Wired Pokémon-battle}}\n|fi={{tt|Tietääkö tietokone?|Does a computer know?}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Engagé pour combattre|Engaged for battle}}\n|he=קרב מחושב{{tt|krav mechushav|Calculated battle}}\n|hu={{tt|A virtuális harcos|The virtual warrior}}\n|it={{tt|Incontri virtuali|Virtual matches}}{{tt|*|Original 2000 dub}} <br> {{tt|Battaglia virtuale|Virtual battle}}{{tt|*|2014 K2 TV dub}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Mania de Batalha!|Battle Mania!}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Preparados para a Batalha!|Ready for the Battle!}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Batalla computarizada!|Computerized battle!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Conectado para el combate|Plugged-in for combat}}\n|pl={{tt|Wciągająca walka|Addictive battle}}\n|sv=Pokémon online\n|ro={{tt|Firul pentru Bătălie|The Wire for Battle}}\n|hi=कंप्यूटर से मुकाबला {{tt|\'\'Computer se Muqabla\'\'|Battle with (the help of) a Computer}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP139 |\nprevtitle=Mild\'n Wooly |\nnextcode=EP141 |\nnexttitle=Good \'Quil Hunting |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Johto | }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0140}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|140]]\n[[Category:Banned episodes]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Atsuhiro Tomioka]]\n[[Category:Episodes by one-time storyboarders]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Tarō Iwasaki]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Katsumi Hashimoto]]\n\n[[de:Verkabelter Pokémon-Kampf]]\n[[es:EP142]]\n[[fr:EP140]]\n[[it:EP140]]\n[[ja:無印編第140話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第141集]]'}
