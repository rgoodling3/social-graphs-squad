A Fury Swipes Goodbye!!\'\') is the sixth episode of the {{series|Advanced Generation}} and the 280th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on December 26, 2002 and in the United States on November 29, 2003. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/06_18-a-poached-ego/-->\n<i>Our heroes are headed for Rustboro City, where Ash hopes to have his first real gym battle in Hoenn. Team Rocket is making their way along the same path when they stumble upon a cage full of Ekans. Jessie is delighted that their work has been done for them and orders Arbok to attack. Arbok can\'t manage to attack the helpless Ekans, however, because it remembers when it used to be an Ekans. Jessie is sympathetic. James soon makes a similar concession when they find a cage of Koffing that Weezing will not hurt. The cages belong to a poacher named Rico who uses his Fearrow and Pupitar to chase off Team Rocket. Team Rocket returns to the scene, now hoping to free the Ekans and Koffing. Things turn dangerous when Rico\'s Pupitar evolves into a Tyrannitar, and Team Rocket is forced to make the ultimate sacrifice for the Pokémon that they love.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Max]] leads the group through [[Petalburg Forest]] with his trusty [[PokéNav]]. However, his older sister {{an|May}} lags behind. She demands a break, and Ash concedes to another pit stop. Max alerts everyone that there is a [[Pokémon Center]] nearby. {{an|Brock}} is keen to meet the resident [[Nurse Joy]] so he grabs May\'s hand to pull her along. Yet May pulls away from Brock\'s grasp and falls backwards into a tree, she discovers that the tree bark has been torn in many places. Speculating as to what is going on, Max suggests that a [[Pokémon battle]] had taken place. Ash isn’t quite convinced as he discovers part of a net embedded into one of the trees. \n\nWhen they arrive at the Pokémon Center, they meet Nurse Joy. May, believing that it is the same Nurse Joy from [[Oldale Town]], tries to greet her, but is surprised when Nurse Joy doesn\'t recognize her. As Max tries to tell her that Pokémon Centers are run by a family of identical-looking Nurse Joys, [[Officer Jenny]] and her {{p|Growlithe}} appear to ask whether any Pokémon had recently been admitted to the Pokémon Center due to the activities of a [[Pokémon poacher]] named [[Rico]], who frequents the area. As Max also explains to May that Officer Jennys are also identical, Ash presents Officer Jenny with the part of the net that they had found. With a lead on Rico, Officer Jenny asks Ash and {{ashfr}} to lead her to where they found it.\n\nMeanwhile, {{TRT}} is on a hill overlooking the Pokémon Center. As they plan to trap Ash and his friends when they return, {{MTR}} calls for them to be more creative. During Meowth’s talk he slips and rolls down a hill. At the bottom, he finds a cage full of {{p|Ekans}}. Learning that the Ekans had been caught and abused by a Pokémon poacher, Meowth tries to free them, but finds that the cage is electrified. At this point, [[Jessie]] and [[James]], riding {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}} and {{TP|James|Weezing}}, arrive. Outraged at how the Ekans are confined, Jessie orders Arbok to use {{m|Acid}} to free the Ekans, but Arbok is reluctant to attack its pre-evolved forms. Jessie is keen to create an Ekans army. Meowth points out that they cannot afford to feed them all, and Jessie replies that he and James will simply have to cut back, much to her teammates\' horror.  After being reassured that the Ekans will not be harmed, Arbok aims an Acid attack on the cage to melt it, but to no avail. Weezing tries to use {{m|Sludge}} to help. However, before Weezing can do that, it is attacked by a {{p|Fearow}}.\n\nThe Fearow\'s Trainer then arrives in a {{wp|Sport utility vehicle|SUV}}. Introducing himself as Rico, he explains that the Ekans are his. He demands to know who they are, so the Rocket trio introduce themselves with their {{motto}}. Weezing suddenly discovers that Rico also has a cage full of {{p|Koffing}} attached to the back of his SUV. Rico soon explains that, under his client\'s request, he is to poach {{type|Poison}} Pokémon with a bonus for every evolved one he can get. He offers Team Rocket a deal, he\'ll leave them unharmed if they hand Arbok and Weezing over to him. Having gone through so much with Arbok and Weezing, and motivated by the imprisoned Ekans and the Koffing, Jessie and James adamantly refuse. Arbok and Weezing prepare to defend themselves as Rico orders Fearow to attack. Fearow easily dodges Arbok\'s {{m|Poison Sting}} and Weezing\'s Sludge, and lands a {{m|Fury Attack}} on them both. When Fearow tries to finish off Arbok with a {{m|Drill Peck}}, however, Arbok catches its beak with a {{m|Wrap}}. Just then, Rico withdraws Fearow for a {{p|Pupitar}}, who proceeds to use {{m|Sandstorm}} to send Team Rocket flying away. Claiming that Arbok and Weezing are too weak for his efforts, Rico leaves to poach more Pokémon.\n\nAsh and his friends arrive back at where they found the net. Max discovers tire tracks, and Brock surmises that Rico must not have gotten too far. Ash then sends out {{AP|Taillow}} to search from the sky. Elsewhere, Team Rocket vows to free the Ekans and Koffing at any cost. Suddenly, a swarm of {{p|Kakuna}} and {{p|Beedrill}} appear, causing Team Rocket to run for cover. Ahead of them is a {{TP|James|Cacnea}}, who brushes the Beedrill off with a {{m|Pin Missile}}. After thanking the Cacnea with a bag of treats, Jessie and James resign to the fact that Rico is now long gone. However, Arbok, with its body lowered to the ground, senses that Rico is near. Saying their goodbyes to Cacnea, the trio runs off.\n\nTaillow soon locates Rico in his SUV, and returns to Ash with the results. Unbeknownst to them, Rico is ambushed by Arbok and Weezing. Using Fearow to blow the smoke away, he discovers that Meowth had used the {{m|Smokescreen}} to sneak in and pick the locks off the cages, being able to withstand the electrified cage due to being subjected to {{AP|Pikachu}}\'s attacks many times before. When Fearow tries to attack Meowth, Arbok batters it with a {{m|Headbutt}} into the cage, knocking it out. Meowth manages to open the cage, freeing the Ekans and Koffing. Arbok and Weezing proceed to knock the poaching gun out of Rico\'s hands.\n\nAngered, Rico sends out Pupitar, who promptly [[Evolution|evolves]] to a {{p|Tyranitar}}. James orders another Smokescreen, and Meowth directs the Ekans and Koffing to flee into the wilderness. However Tyranitar fires off a {{m|Hyper Beam}}, and the warning shot stops everyone in their tracks. Jessie gets an idea and calls on {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} to {{m|Counter}} Tyranitar\'s attacks. Yet Tyranitar quickly knocks out Wobbuffet with a Hyper Beam before he can use the [[move]]. With no other choice, Jessie and James order Arbok and Weezing to leave with the Ekans and Koffing, while they buy some time to allow them to escape. Though reluctant at first, Arbok and Weezing do so. Rico tries to use another Hyper Beam to cut them off, but Meowth attacks with a {{m|Fury Swipes}} to Tyranitar\'s face. Jessie and James also use their "Fury Swipes" to stall for time, although they get battered in the process. Arbok and Weezing watch in horror as they witness Team Rocket getting beaten up, and they tearfully leave with the Ekans and Koffing. Eventually, however, Tyranitar defeats the trio, and Rico leaves to look for the escaped Poison Pokémon. Team Rocket latch onto Rico’s boots as he walks off, but he shakes them off and leaves them lying on the ground.\n\nAfterwards, Rico is confronted Ash and his friends, as Officer Jenny tries to arrest him. Rico quickly sends out Fearow to resist the arrest, but Fearow is knocked out by Pikachu\'s {{m|Thunderbolt}}. Officer Jenny also orders Growlithe to knock the gun and Tyranitar\'s {{i|Poké Ball}} from Rico\'s hands. With Rico unable to evade arrest, Officer Jenny orders him to let go of the Pokémon he has poached. However, he informs her that the poached Pokémon had escaped due to Team Rocket\'s actions. Ash remarks how, with bad guys like Team Rocket around, there are still good guys in the world.\n\nBy evening, Jessie and James walk through the forest, wondering if Arbok and Weezing managed to evade Rico. Although Meowth claims that all of the battling against Ash\'s Pokémon had hardened them against any threat, but the pair remain feeling uncertain. Just then, the wild Cacnea who helped them out earlier reappears, carrying the same unopened bag of cookies. James kindly opens the bag up and hands Cacnea one of the treats. When James asks if it would like to come with them, Cacnea obliges, accidentally poking James with its spines as it hugs him.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{an|May}} learns that there are multiple identical [[Nurse Joy]]s and [[Officer Jenny]]s in different cities.\n* [[Jessie]] and [[James]] release {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}} and {{TP|James|Weezing}}.\n* James catches a {{TP|James|Cacnea}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Cacnea}} ({{OP|James|Cacnea}})\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* [[Officer Jenny]]\n* [[Rico]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP AG006.png|thumb|200px|right|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Larvitar}}\n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Taillow}} ({{OP|Ash|Swellow}})\n* {{p|Arbok}} ({{OP|Jessie|Arbok}}; released)\n* {{p|Weezing}} ({{OP|James|Weezing}}; released)\n* {{p|Cacnea}} ({{OP|James|Cacnea}}; new; debut)\n* {{p|Growlithe}} ({{OP|Officer Jenny|Growlithe}})\n* {{p|Fearow}} ([[Rico]]\'s)\n* {{p|Pupitar}} ([[Rico]]\'s; evolves)\n* {{p|Tyranitar}} ([[Rico]]\'s; newly evolved)\n* {{p|Ekans}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Koffing}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Kakuna}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Beedrill}} (multiple)\n\n==Trivia==\n* The gun [[Rico]] used is an {{wp|FN P90}}.\n* The English episode title is a pun on "{{wp|poached egg}}".\n* {{TP|James|Weezing}} appears to have a different voice than usual in this episode.\n* As of this episode, all of the [[Kanto]] Pokémon that belonged to [[Jessie]] and [[James]] are no longer part of their team. Of the Pokémon obtained in the {{series|original}}, only {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} is left.\n* Despite Who\'s That Pokémon being random, this episode coincidentally features all of {{p|Larvitar}}\'s evolutionary family, if it\'s included, as both {{p|Pupitar}} and {{p|Tyranitar}} are featured in the episode.\n* In this episode, [[Max]] describes the [[Hoenn]] region as a country.\n\n===Errors===\n* At one point, when Rico orders his {{p|Fearow}} to attack, he tells it to use "Fury" rather than {{m|Fury Attack}}.\n* When {{TRT}} is seen plotting against Rico, after they were blasted off, the sound of Wobbuffet coming out of his {{i|Poké Ball}} can be heard even though he is standing right next to Jessie.\n* After {{MTR}} falls down the hill, the "R" on James\'s shirt is missing.\n* The blurb for this episode spells Tyranitar as \'\'Tyrannitar\'\'. Along with this, the blurb also spells Weezing as \'\'Wheezing\'\' and Fearow as \'\'Fearrow\'\'.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* The sounds of Rico\'s gun being cocked every time he readies it are removed in the dubbed and international versions.\n* In the dub, music from \'\'[[M01|Mewtwo Strikes Back]]\'\' is used when [[Jessie]] and [[James]] release {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}} and {{TP|James|Weezing}} and fights Rico\'s {{p|Tyranitar}} by themselves. In the original, music from \'\'[[M02|The Power of One]]\'\' is used instead.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=9999FF|bordercolor=FF7777\n|zh_cmn={{tt|火箭隊！瘋狂亂抓，再見了！|Team Rocket!
