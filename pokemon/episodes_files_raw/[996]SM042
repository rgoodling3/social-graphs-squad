It first aired in Japan on September 14, 2017 and in the United States on November 25, 2017 as part of a marathon including \'\'[[SM041|Mounting an Electrifying Charge!]]\'\' and \'\'[[M20|I Choose You!]]\'\'.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/20_42-alola-kanto/-->\n<i>Ash’s Pokémon School class is taking a field trip to the Kanto region! Principal Oak is excited to visit his famous cousin in Pallet Town, and Professor Kukui says some special guests will be joining them. When those guests turn out to be Brock and Misty, Ash is delighted!\n\nEveryone marvels at the many Pokémon living at Professor Oak’s lab, and Brock offers a demonstration of the difference between Kanto Pokémon and their Alolan counterparts. Of course, Team Rocket is up to their old tricks, but the “original Twerp trio” quickly sends them blasting off again. Tomorrow, Misty has big plans for everyone: a battle at her own Cerulean Gym!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Samson Oak]] informs the class that they will be having a special extracurricular activity to celebrate the Pokémon School\'s twentieth anniversary. When {{an|Mallow}} asks where they will be going, {{an|Professor Kukui}} replies that they will be heading to the [[Kanto]] [[region]] and that there will be special guests meeting them there, exciting the class, especially {{Ash}}.\n\nAs they reach Kanto via plane, the students express their desires to meet certain Kantonian Pokémon. {{an|Lillie}} notices [[Snowy]] not feeling well; a young man, later introduced to her as {{an|Brock}}, asks her if he can take a look at Snowy and that he is a Pokémon {{tc|Doctor}}-in-training. Lillie gives the man her consent. {{TRT}} also arrives in Kanto and is heading to the {{an|Team Rocket HQ|headquarters}}. [[Jessie]] becomes angry and fusses about [[Matori]] telling them to come there. [[James]] worries if they will get a lecture from her and {{an|Giovanni}}. {{MTR}} tries to comfort himself by reassuring that giving Matori a doughnut will not make her angry.\n\nBrock informs Lillie that Snowy is only experiencing motion sickness and that it will be fine after a while. Just then, Ash notices Brock and calls out to him. Ash runs toward Brock, but Brock runs past him and chases the cabin attendant who walked past Ash. As Brock flirts with her, {{an|Misty}} arrives to pull him away from the cabin attendant by the ear. Ash introduces {{ashcl}} to Misty and Brock, and they present themselves as the [[Gym Leader]]s of the [[Cerulean Gym]] and [[Pewter Gym]], respectively. Ash\'s classmates also introduce themselves to Misty and Brock. When Ash asks what they are doing in the airport, Misty reveals Professor Oak asked them to meet the class. Professor Kukui and Samson Oak interrupt the conversation and tell them to head to the laboratory. Meanwhile, Team Rocket, having eavesdropped on the entire conversation, decides to head to the laboratory to steal all of the Pokémon residing there and give them to {{an|Giovanni}} so that they do not get lectured.\n\nSamuel Oak and Samson Oak are excited to meet each other; the former congratulates the latter on the school\'s twentieth anniversary. {{Rotom}} is surprised to see their identical appearances. Samson Oak introduces the class to his cousin. Professor Oak begins to recite a senryū and the class is impressed. Rotom recites its own senryū, and the Oaks praise its creation. Misty and Brock are made in charge of showing the class around the laboratory\'s Oak Corral. The class becomes excited at the vastness of the corral and expresses hopes of meeting certain kinds of new Pokémon. Lillie gets excited at seeing {{p|Spearow}}, but {{an|Mallow}} reminds her that Spearow are fairly common in [[Alola]] as well. Ash tells his classmates that his Pokémon are in the Oak Corral as well; he notices his herd of {{AP|Tauros}} and starts running towards them. Tauros, excited to see Ash, run towards him as well, and knock Ash into the sky.\n\nKiawe and Rotom see a {{p|Rapidash}} at the edge of a cliff. Rapidash dashes forward and Kiawe sends out his Charizard to follow and race with it. They increase their speed and Kiawe realizes that Rapidash wants him to ride on it; Kiawe jumps from his Charizard and climbs onto Rapidash. Mallow and her {{TP|Mallow|Steenee}} meet two {{p|Gloom}} and a {{p|Vileplume}}. Vileplume greets her and uses {{m|Poison Powder}}; Brock and Misty warn her and Mallow runs off with her Steenee. Meanwhile, Ash, Lillie, {{an|Lana}} and Sophocles see a {{p|Raichu}}. {{TP|Sophocles|Togedemaru}} becomes excited at seeing the Mouse Pokémon and runs around in circles. She produces electricity and shocks Raichu unconscious, to which Sophocles apologizes. Later, the group notices a {{p|Ninetales}} in a forested area and Snowy walks toward it. The Ninetales licks Snowy\'s head in greeting. They also see a {{p|Dewgong}} jumping out of a lake. {{TP|Lana|Popplio}} blows a bubble at the Dewgong, who bounces it on its forehead. Concurrently, Rotom is traveling around the corral, taking photographs of different Pokémon.\n\nAt the back of the laboratory, Brock and Misty send out a Kantonian and an {{alo|Exeggutor}} respectively. The Kantonian {{p|Exeggutor}} becomes surprised with its Alolan counterpart. The class comments on the major differences between the two regional Exeggutor. Both variants of {{p|Geodude}} and {{p|Muk}} are sent out, with the Kantonian [[Ash\'s Muk|Muk]] happy to see Ash. Both variants of {{p|Dugtrio}} are sent out as well. Kiawe is startled to see the Kantonian Dugtrio not having hair and gives it his wig. Lastly, Brock sends out a Kantonian {{p|Marowak}}, and Kiawe sends out his [[Kiawe\'s Marowak|Alolan Marowak]]. Upon seeing their counterparts, the two Marowak begin to fight each other. Kiawe and Brock try to restrain the two Marowak, to no avail. Sophocles and Lillie comment on their different typing; Alolan Marowak being {{t|Fire}} and {{type|Ghost}} while Kantonian Marowak being {{type|Ground}}. Pikachu tries to calm the two Marowak down, but is attacked instead, sending him flying in the air. Togedemaru becomes furious and attacks the Marowak, but is chased by them. Pikachu lands on the ground and uses {{m|Thunderbolt}}, shocking everyone except the Kantonian Marowak, who is unaffected due to being a Ground-type. Lana and Kiawe realize that Popplio and Marowak have gone missing and the group decides to look for them. On search, Ash, Misty and Brock come across a {{p|Caterpie}}, causing Misty to run away in fear. Ash asks her if she has still not overcome her fear of {{type|Bug}} Pokémon, to which Misty agrees. Afterwards, they reminisce about the adventures they used to have together. Just then, they hear a sound, and head to find the source. They see the {{p|Bellsprout}} and {{p|Oddish}}\'s evolutionary lines arguing, with [[Ash\'s Bulbasaur]] trying to pacify. Ash calls out to Bulbasaur, who is delighted to see Ash.\n\nLillie, Lana, and Mallow climb up a slope, looking for Popplio, when they hear Misty calling out to them. Misty suggests looking for Popplio near the lake ahead of them. At the lake, a {{p|Gyarados}} emerges from the water and frightens the girls, except Lana who stands firm. Lana changes to her swimsuit and jumps into the lake; Misty follows suit. At the bottom of the lake, they see Popplio hanging out with the {{type|Water}} Pokémon. The boys are looking for Kiawe\'s Marowak in a rocky area, where they run into an {{p|Onix}}. Worried that the Onix might attack, and Kiawe sends out his {{TP|Kiawe|Turtonator}}. Brock tells them to calm down, to not anger the Onix. However, Kiawe\'s Marowak appears and throws its bone at the Onix, angering it, and causing the group to flee from the Rock Snake Pokémon.\n\nThe two groups meet up, and a net appears and captures their Pokémon, which is revealed to be Team Rocket\'s doing. Misty and Brock get angry at Team Rocket for still being up their usual tactics. Ash sends out {{AP|Lycanroc}} and commands it to use {{m|Rock Throw}}. Team Rocket, in their mecha, deflects the attack back at the group. Brock and Misty send out their {{TP|Brock|Crobat}} and {{TP|Misty|Staryu}} respectively. Together, they destroy the mecha, but Team Rocket refuses to give up, and Jessie sends out her {{TP|Jessie|Mimikyu}}; Bulbasaur shudders from the Disguise Pokémon. Suddenly, a plane flies past and {{an|Bewear}} jumps down. It takes off with Team Rocket. The wreckage shakes and {{an|Jigglypuff}} appears out of it. Mallow, Lillie, and Lana are happy to see a {{p|Jigglypuff}} for the first time. Ash, Misty, and Brock, however, recognize the Jigglypuff and fear that it might {{m|sing}}. True that, and everyone falls asleep to Jigglypuff\'s song. Jigglypuff becomes angry at its audience falling asleep again and uses its microphone-marker to draw on their faces. They wake up in the evening and laughs at the drawings on each other\'s faces. {{Delia}} appears and tells them that the welcome party is about to start.\n\nBack at the laboratory, the group eats the food prepared by [[Mimey]]. Delia welcomes them to Kanto and asks Kiawe if he would like to take a look at Ash\'s bedroom. Rotom Dex becomes disappointed that it is missing a photo of one more Pokémon; a {{p|Mew}} overhears it and flies away. Professor Kukui informs the class that they will be heading to the Cerulean Gym for a Gym battle the following day. The next day, they travel past the Cerulean Gym. Ash exclaims that he cannot wait for a battle.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

This is the longest absence a recurring wild Pokémon has ever had in the main series.\n*** As such, this marks the first appearance of Jigglypuff in person in a [[Pokémon Company International]]-dubbed TV episode, as well as Misty.\n** [[Misty\'s Staryu]], whose previous appearance was in \'\'[[EP259|Entei at Your Own Risk]]\'\', 722 episodes earlier. This is the longest absence a Pokémon belonging to a main character has ever had in the main series up to this point. This record was later broken in \'\'[[SM102|Alola, Alola!]]\'\' by [[Misty\'s Corsola]], who returned after an absence of 723 episodes, just one episode more than Staryu.\n** Furthermore, this is the first-ever physical main series appearance of a {{p|Mew}}.\n*** As a result, as of this episode, all 151 [[Generation I]] Pokémon have made a physical appearance in the main series.\n* This episode marks the first appearance of a number of Pokémon species in the main series after long absences:\n** {{p|Tangela}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[AG156|From Cradle to Save!]]\'\', 551 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Seel}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[DP140|Historical Mystery Tour!]]\'\', 375 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Dewgong}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[DP171|Dawn of a Royal Day!]]\'\', 344 episodes ago.\n** A regular {{p|Marowak}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[DP173|Dealing With a Fierce Double Ditto Drama!]]\'\', 342 episodes ago.\n** A regular {{p|Geodude}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[DP182|An Old Family Blend!]]\'\', 333 episodes ago.\n** {{p|Larvitar}}, who last appeared in \'\'[[BW088|The Mystery of the Missing Cubchoo!]]\'\', 236 episodes earlier.\n* This episode marks the first time that any of Ash\'s friends or classmates have visited [[Professor Oak\'s Laboratory]] since \'\'[[AG133|The Right Place and the Right Mime]]\'\', 574 episodes earlier.\n* Despite {{p|Rapidash}} having made multiple appearances in the anime ever since the [[S01|first season]], this is the first time a [[Pokédex]] entry for it is shown.\n** Furthermore, the way Rapidash runs in the open field is a reference to a similar scene from the first Pokémon opening, [[Aim to Be a Pokémon Master]], and its English counterpart, [[Pokémon Theme]].\n* This episodes features flashbacks to \'\'[[EP021|Bye Bye Butterfree]]\'\', \'\'[[EP051|Bulbasaur\'s Mysterious Garden]]\'\', \'\'[[EP134|Charizard\'s Burning Ambitions]]\'\', \'\'Entei at Your Own Risk\'\', and \'\'[[EP273|Gotta Catch Ya Later!]]\'\'.\n* When Misty dives with {{an|Lana}}, she is seen wearing a bikini similar to the one [[Misty|her game counterpart]] is seen wearing in the [[Generation I]] games (excluding {{game|Yellow}}).\n* {{p|Horsea}} is seen with two fins, which could be a reference to [[:File:116Horsea RB.png|its original Generation I artwork]].\n* [[Jessie]] [[Breaking the fourth wall|breaks the fourth wall]] by pushing away her thought balloon depicting [[Matori]].\n* An instrumental version of [[Aim to Be a Pokémon Master|Aim to Be a Pokémon Master -20th Anniversary-]] is used as an insert song when [[Snowy]] meets a {{p|Ninetales}}.\n** Also, the manner in which Ninetales appears (where it was seen standing still under the sunlight) resembles another Ninetales that appeared in \'\'[[EP232|Just Waiting On a Friend]]\'\'.\n* When Professor Oak recites the senryū of {{p|Bulbasaur}}, the [[Professor Oak\'s Pokémon Lecture]]\'s format is used.\n* {{TRT}} recites their {{DL|Team Rocket mottos|Kanto, Orange Archipelago, Johto, and Hoenn|original motto}} in this episode. As a result, this motto has been recited at least once in every [[series]] so far. They also use the original Team Rocket logo instead of the streamlined model that has been in use since the {{series|Best Wishes}}, while James is seen having his famous rose. The background music of the motto was the same as in the {{series|XY}}.\n* The [[Aim to Be a Pokémon Master|Japanese opening]] for this episode includes ad-lib lines by Misty, Brock, and Professor Oak, much like the original version of the opening.\n* The inside of the mecha Meowth pilots in the episode appears to resemble the controls of the mobile suits that appear in \'\'{{wp|Mobile Fighter G Gundam}}\'\', specifically the head and wrist attachments resembling the Mobile Trace System.\n* {{an|Kiawe}}\'s wig from \'\'[[SM023|Getting the Band Back Together!]]\'\' makes a reappearance.\n* The [[Pokémon School]]\'s 20th anniversary is a reference to the anime\'s 20th anniversary.\n* Despite this episode mostly taking place at Professor Oak\'s Laboratory, where {{Tracey}} currently resides, he isn\'t seen or mentioned at all throughout the episode.\n* In the original version, Team Rocket\'s line when {{an|Bewear}} grabs them is spoken by Misty instead of Team Rocket themselves.\n* This and the next episode feature thirteen main characters, the most amount in the overall series so far.\n* The [[narrator]] is only heard at the end of this episode, while the beginning lacks narration completely.\n* All of the Western dub titles are the same as the English title.\n\n===Errors===\n* When {{AP|Pikachu}} uses {{m|Thunderbolt}} on everybody, {{TP|Sophocles|Togedemaru}} gets zapped despite having {{a|Lightning Rod}} as her [[Ability]].\n* When [[Brock\'s Crobat]] uses {{m|Supersonic}}, it opens its mouth. When the scene changes to the Supersonic hitting [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|Team Rocket\'s mecha]], its mouth is closed.\n* When Jigglypuff puffs up in anger, the black band and silver base on the bottom of Jigglypuff\'s microphone turned silver and dark gray respectively for a split second. Also, the band\'s width is smaller than normal during this goof.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* When Team Rocket are discussing their reasons for traveling to Kanto in the airport, Matori\'s name is replaced with the nickname "loser locks" in one of Meowth\'s lines.\n* During the party, the drinks {{an|Professor Kukui}}, Professor Oak, and Samson Oak are holding have their colors changed to green.\n\n<gallery>\nSM042 dub edit original.png|Orange drinks in the original version\nSM042 dub edit.png|Green drinks in the dub\n</gallery>\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=90BDDC|bordercolor=F1912B\n|zh_cmn={{tt|阿羅拉，關都！小剛與小霞！！|Alola, Kanto!
