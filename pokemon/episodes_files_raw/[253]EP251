It was first broadcast in Japan on June 6, 2002 and in the United States on May 31, 2003. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/05_41-beauty-is-skin-deep/-->\n<i>Finally reaching the outskirts of Blackthorn City, Ash pushes to quickly seek out the gym where he hopes to earn his final Johto badge. Before he has the opportunity, he chances into a Dratini and learns that its eager trainer, Clair, is in fact the Blackthorn Gym leader. Ash\'s attempt to challenge her to a duel—and Brock\'s attempts at getting her phone number—are both cut short when Team Rocket arrives, intent on stealing the Gym Leader\'s Dratini right out from under her. After dispatching with these hapless villains, Ash secures Clair\'s promise to face him in her gym. Cheerfully Ash and friends march the last few miles into the city.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nHaving nearly arrived at [[Blackthorn City]], {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} find a {{p|Dratini}} curled up and sleeping underneath a tree. However, when they try to get a closer look, a {{p|Gyarados}} appears and keeps them at bay using a {{m|Hydro Pump}}. A mysterious woman appears, threatening them if they try to harm the Dratini. After the confusion is sorted, the woman introduces herself as [[Clair]], and explains that her Gyarados was simply trying to protect her Dratini. However, when Dratini begins swimming away, Clair and Gyarados leaves in pursuit. Ash then runs into her elderly assistant, [[Kaburagi]], who informs them that Clair is the Blackthorn [[Gym Leader]], and must perform a ritual with the [[Dragon Fang]]. As they slowly follow Clair and her Dratini upstream, Kaburagi reveals the local history: an unidentified {{t|Dragon}} Pokémon had terrorized local residents, until it was defeated by the {{OBP|Gym Leader|EP253|first Blackthorn Gym Leader}}, who took one of its fangs as a sign of victory. Since then, the Dragon Fang has been handed down through generations, and today is the day that they must perform a purification ritual.\n\nMeanwhile, {{TRT}}, further upstream, is relaxing when Dratini passes by. [[Jessie]] is enamored by the Dratini, hoping to catch one for herself. As [[James]] sends out {{TP|James|Weezing}}, they are suddenly doused in Gyarados\'s Hydro Pump, and soon come face-to -face with Clair. When Team Rocket tries to threaten her, she has her Gyarados use another Hydro Pump to them flying. Meanwhile, Ash and company, with Kaburagi, manage to make up their ground with Clair. Kaburagi implores Clair to return in time for the ritual, but Clair objects, seeing as Dratini is preparing to shed its skin - a point in which Dratini are the most vulnerable. When Dratini leaves, Clair and Gyarados follow, and Ash and company have no choice but to follow them, and let Dratini shed its skin before preparing for the ritual. Team Rocket, intending on stealing Dratini, are also in pursuit - though James contends that Dratini would fetch a high price either on the open market or as a gift to {{an|Giovanni}}, Jessie is adamant that she is keeping Dratini for herself, thinking that it is cute.\n\nKnowing that pursuing Dratini may take the entire day, Clair takes a break for lunch. This gives an opportunity for Ash to challenge Clair, which Clair accepts. Kaburagi, noticing that Ash had won the [[Badge]] from [[Mahogany Town]], asks them whether the rumors of a [[Red Gyarados]] rampaging near town were true. Ash and company proceed to tell them the whole story and met [[Lance]]. Clair and her assistant are surprised at the fact that Lance is a [[Pokémon G-Men|Pokémon G-Man]], which surprises Ash, not knowing that they, too, are acquainted with Lance. Clair reveals that the two are both Dragon {{pkmn|Trainer}}s who had trained with each other. Knowing this, Ash and Clair are both excited for their upcoming battle. Their lunch is disrupted by [[List of Team Rocket\'s disguises|an elderly couple]], who wants to take pictures with Dratini. Though Clair is reluctant, she allows the couple to go near Dratini, only for the couple to trap Dratini in a net. The couple reveals themselves to be Jessie and James, while {{MTR}} covers their escape using a smoke bomb.\n\nWhile Clair is in hot pursuit of Team Rocket\'s [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|balloon]], Dratini tries desperately to break free by rocking the balloon. When the balloon crashes, it makes a desperate attempt to escape into the water, which Jessie quickly stops. This allows Clair to catch up. Trying to defend themselves, James sends out Weezing, but it is dispatched easily by Gyarados. {{an|Pikachu}} tries to {{m|Thunderbolt}} Team Rocket to send them flying, but {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}}\'s {{m|Counter}} deflects the attack in all directions, hitting Ash, Pikachu, Team Rocket, and nearly hitting {{an|Misty}}, {{an|Brock}}, and Kaburagi. As one of the errant bolts is about to hit Dratini, Clair dives to protect it. Just at that moment, Dratini [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Dragonair}}, much to Jessie\'s dismay who contends that it was much cuter as a Dratini. As Dragonair is far rarer, Team Rocket presses on their attack, but thanks to Gyarados\'s {{m|Hyper Beam}} and Dragonair\'s {{m|Twister}}, they are sent flying.\n\nJust as they celebrate their victory, Dragonair leaves, with everyone in pursuit. By nightfall, they all reach Riverhead Falls, the source of the water that leads into Blackthorn City, and the perfect place for the ritual. Ash and company are witnesses to the purification ritual, in which Clair says a prayer and proceeds to drench the Dragon Fang in the lake water. The Dragon Fang reacts, and sends a dragon-shaped beam of light into the sky. Kaburagi explains that after a Dragon Pokémon dies, its body becomes a star in the sky.\n\nThe next day, Ash and his friends finally make it to the entry gates of Blackthorn City, as the [[Blackthorn Gym]] awaits.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} reach [[Blackthorn City]] and meet [[Clair]], the local [[Gym Leader]].\n* Ash challenges Clair to a [[Gym]] battle.\n* Clair\'s {{p|Dratini}} evolves into {{TP|Clair|Dragonair}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* [[Clair]]\n* [[Kaburagi]]\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* [[Clair\'s Dragonair]]\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n[[File:PMTV EP251.png|thumb|200px|right|{{tt|Pocket Monster TV|Who\'s That Pokémon}}]]\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Clair]]\n* [[Kaburagi]]\n* [[Lance]] (flashback)\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP EP251.png|thumb|200px|right|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Goldeen}} \'\'(US and international)\'\', {{p|Dratini}} \'\'(Japan)\'\'\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Togepi}} ({{OP|Misty|Togepi}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Arbok}} ({{OP|Jessie|Arbok}})\n* {{p|Weezing}} ({{OP|James|Weezing}})\n* {{p|Dratini}} ({{OP|Clair|Dratini}}; evolves)\n* {{p|Dragonair}} ({{OP|Clair|Dragonair}}; newly evolved)\n* {{p|Gyarados}} ([[Clair]]\'s)\n* {{p|Dragonite}} ({{OP|Lance|Dragonite}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Gyarados}} ([[Lance]]\'s; [[Red Gyarados]]; flashback)\n\n==Trivia==\n* This episode begins the five part [[Blackthorn City]] arc.\n* The English dub title is a reference to the phrase "\'\'beauty is only skin deep\'\'".\n** A similar dub title was also used with [[SM114|a future episode]].\n* Music from \'\'[[M01|Mewtwo Strikes Back]]\'\' and \'\'[[M02|The Power of One]]\'\' can be heard in the background.\n* Near the end of the episode, [[Kaburagi]] says, "Yes, once a dragon Pokemon becomes a star, it watches over all dragon Pokémon. At least, that\'s what the popular legends tell us happens". This may be a reference to the movie \'\'{{wp|Dragonheart}}\'\', which also tells that in their legends, when a dragon dies, it becomes a star in the sky where it watches over us from.\n* Due to the [[Banned episodes|banning]] of [[EP035]], this episode marks the physical debut of a Dratini in the dub, effectively making it the final [[Generation I]] Pokémon to debut in the dub.\n\n===Errors===\n* The beams connecting the basket to the {{MTR}} head on {{TRT}}\'s balloon appear to be entirely green for a second.\n* [[Clair]]\'s {{p|Dratini}}\'s eyes are all black at the beginning of the episode, but the rest of the time there is red on the bottoms of its eyes.\n* {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} uses Counter against {{AP|Pikachu}}\'s Thunderbolt, when it should have been Mirror Coat.\n* When [[James]] sends out his {{TP|James|Weezing}}, it\'s facing the opposite direction.\n* When Ash was showing his [[Badge]]s to Clair, it is seen that he stands up. However in the next scene, he is sitting down even though it never showed him sitting down.\n* In the {{pmin|Poland|Polish}} dub, the echo effect is not present in the flashback of [[Lance]] {{pkmn2|caught|catching}} the [[Red Gyarados]], and {{m|Hyper Beam}} is referred to as {{m|Thunder Wave}}.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* Clair refers to her rice balls as sandwiches.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|bg={{tt|Красотата е повърхностна|Beauty is superficial}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|小樁跟迷你龍|Clair and Dratini}}\n|de={{tt|Porentief rein!|Clean down to the pores!}}\n|nl={{tt|Schoonheid Zit van Binnen|Beauty is on the inside}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Un adorable petit Pokémon|An adorable small Pokémon}}\n|he=שן הדרקון {{tt|shen hadracon|The Dragon Fang}}\n|it={{tt|L\'ultima Medaglia (prima parte)|The last Badge (part 1)}}\n|pt_br={{tt|A Beleza está além da Pele|The Beauty is beyond the Skin}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|A Lenda do Dente de Dragão|The Legend of the Dragon\'s Teeth}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡La belleza es pasajera!|Beauty comes and goes!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|La belleza está en el interior|The beauty is on the inside}}\n|pl={{tt|Piękno tkwi w głębi|Beauty lies in the inside}}\n|hi=Dratini से Dragonite तक {{tt|\'\'Dratini se Dragonite tak\'\'|From Dratini to Dragonite}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP250 |\nnextcode=EP252 |\nnexttitle=Fangs for Nothin\' |\nseries=Original series |\nepisodelist=List of original series episodes |\ncolorscheme=Johto }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0251}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|251]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Shinzō Fujita]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded and directed by Yoshito Hata]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Yoshito Hata]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Yoshito Hata]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Masaru Fukumoto]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which an alternately colored Pokémon appears]]\n\n[[de:Porentief rein]]\n[[es:EP253]]\n[[fr:EP251]]\n[[ja:無印編第251話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第252集]]'}
