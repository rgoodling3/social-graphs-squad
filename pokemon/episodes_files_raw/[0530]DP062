It first aired in Japan on January 10, 2008, and in the United States on June 21, 2008.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/tv-episodes/season-11/episode-10-11_10-tanks-for-the-memories/-->\n<i>Brock leads his friends to the Mountain Hut Maid Café, where waitresses Spring, Summer, and Autumn serve up fresh Miltank milk. Spring and Summer\'s Miltank are perfectly trained, but Autumn\'s new Miltank, Ilta, won\'t listen to anything Autumn says. Autumn is ready to give up on Ilta, but Brock wants to repair the relationship between Trainer and Pokémon.\n\nWith Brock\'s guidance, Autumn tries to earn Ilta\'s trust, only to lose her temper when Ilta still doesn\'t do what she expects. When Autumn tries to get Ilta to cross a bridge, Autumn nearly falls off and has to be rescued by Brock and Happiny. Frustrated by her own clumsiness, she\'s ready to give up until Brock gives her some words of encouragement.\n\nAfter Autumn helps protect Ilta from a swarm of Beedrill, it looks like Trainer and Pokémon just might make it after all. In the meantime, Team Rocket tries to duplicate the success of the Mountain Hut Maid Café, but they\'ve hit a snag: they have no Miltank milk! To remedy the problem, they catch Brock and Autumn by surprise and fly off with both the Trainers and the real target, Ilta! Brock\'s Happiny uses Secret Power to put Team Rocket to sleep, allowing Brock and Autumn to escape and defeat Team Rocket. With Autumn and Ilta finally a team, our own team of heroes gets back on the road toward Veilstone City!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{cleanup|section}}\nAs {{Ash}} becomes excited about his next [[Gym]] {{pkmn|battle}} at [[Veilstone City]] and {{an|Dawn}} expresses her need to take a break and think about her next [[Pokémon Contest]], {{an|Brock}} decides to take his friends to the [[Café Cabin|Mountain Hut Maid Café]]. There, they meet the three maids, {{OBP|Autumn|DP062}}, {{OBP|Spring and Summer|DP062|Spring, and Summer}}. Brock immediately goes for Spring and Summer, but is stopped by {{TP|Brock|Croagunk}}. After recovering, Spring, Autumn, and Summer take all three of them to the barn for {{p|Miltank}} milk at their request. Once there, Spring\'s two Miltank and Summer\'s Miltank happily run into the barn, hooking themselves up to give Ash and friends a nice round of milk. Everyone sends out their Pokémon to enjoy it as well.\n\nBrock then asks about Autumn\'s Miltank. She says her Miltank, Ilta, is outside and doesn\'t listen to her since she just got her. She also claimed that she was thinking about [[Released Pokémon|releasing]] her since she \'isn\'t that cute anyway\'. Brock jumps in, saying that Autumn shouldn\'t just give up on her Miltank. Spring then compliments on Brock\'s knowledge, causing Brock to proclaim his dream of becoming a great {{tc|Pokémon Breeder}}. He also claims that he can help Autumn with any problems she may have with her Miltank, becoming quite flirtatious with Spring. Predictably, Croagunk {{m|Poison Jab}}s him once again.\n\nSummer then calls to her sisters about the café, saying it\'s becoming full. Spring tells Autumn to stay with Brock while Dawn and Ash decide to help Spring and Summer with their customers, two boys that are seen later in the show. {{TRT}} sees Ash, Dawn, and their Pokémon working in the Maid Cafe and then decide to build one of their own.\n\nMeanwhile, Brock tells Autumn that a good way to bond with Pokémon is to [[Friendship|gain its trust]]. When Autumn asks how one can gain the trust of Pokémon, Brock demonstrates on his {{TP|Brock|Happiny}}. Autumn tries it for herself, repeating the process with Ilta. When Ilta ignores her, Autumn gets frustrated, only to calm down when Brock tells Autumn to be \'kind and patient\'. Autumn tries again, but Ilta eats the flower that Autumn was addressing, so she throws a fit. Brock simply walks over to Ilta, petting her head and asking her if the flower tasted good. When Autumn tried to do the same, she thought Ilta was leaning in to give her a small kiss, but Ilta belched in her face. Autumn of course threw another fit.\n\nBrock then suggests working on \'praise giving\' by letting Pokémon overcome fear through kind words. A rickety bridge is the next setting for the two. Brock and Happiny go first. Happiny gets scared, but overcomes the fear when Brock cheers her on. With a bit of struggling, Brock was able to get Ilta to try to cross the bridge with a [[Pecha Berry]]. Ilta tries to cross, but becomes frightened in the middle. Brock reminds Autumn that she must cheer Ilta on. Upon doing so, Autumn smacks Ilta in the back, trying to be encouraging, but winds up tripping and falling to the side. Ilta, receiving the blow on the back, fell to the other side of the bridge. Autumn falls over the rope and hangs above the raging rapids below. Brock runs over to save her, grabbing onto her hand before it was too late. However, Brock, too, began to fall off the bridge. Fortunately, in a spurt of quick thinking Happiny runs over and grabs Brock\'s leg, flinging both him and Autumn back over the edge and where they started. Eventually, Happiny and Ilta eating happily, while Autumn cries over what happened and Brock tries to reassure her.\n\nLater, Spring tells Ash that the rush hour is over and that she can handle it. Excited, Ash runs off with his {{AP|Turtwig}} to practice Turtwig\'s {{m|Energy Ball}}. Dawn looks sadly at Ash\'s enthusiasm, still upset about her [[DP061|last Contest]].\n\nThe two boys from earlier encounter at a new café that isn\'t on their map. Upon entering, they are greeted by [[Jessie]] in a maid outfit, [[James]] in a butler suit, and {{MTR}} in a baby costume. Once the boys are seated, Team Rocket asks if they want coffee. Even though they said no, Team Rocket insisted on it and {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}}, in another maid costume, gets them a cup.\n\nTurtwig is eventually able to produce an Energy Ball, but is unable to really use it as an attack as of yet. Turtwig becomes upset, but regains happiness when Ash comforts and encourages it. Dawn, who was watching the practice session, became pumped up and thought of also working hard. Upon getting out her {{i|Poké Ball}}, she started thinking about what [[Zoey]] said to her. She lost her will yet again. {{TP|Dawn|Piplup}} looked sadly at his Trainer. Although Dawn tried to reassure Piplup that she was all right, Dawn began to get upset and cry. Ash, seeing her cry, asked why she had been crying, and when Ash asks if she had something in her eye, she dismisses it as just that. Ash then says he is hungry, and Dawn suggests getting some ice cream. Ash jumps at the chance and they leave.\n\nMeanwhile, Brock requests that Autumn wash Ilta. Brock demonstrates, saying that it is a good way to make sure your Pokémon is healthy and looks good. When Autumn tried, she accidentally scrubbed Ilta too much, covering Ilta\'s face with suds. She then runs to get some water, but accidentally splashes both Ilta and Brock. When she goes to get Brock a towel, she also slips on a bar of soap. When Brock inquired if Autumn is okay, Autumn tells him no and complains that she is clumsy and useless. Brock simply smiles, and asks how she can expect Ilta to listen to her if she keeps losing it. Finally, Autumn makes a U-turn, saying she won\'t cry again.\n\nElsewhere, the boys aren\'t happy with Team Rocket\'s coffee and claim it is \'just a cup of hot water\'. After Jessie has a fit, the two leave saying that since there wasn\'t Miltank milk, they weren\'t going to stay. Of course Jessie comes up with a plan to get the Miltank.\n\nIlta comes across an apple tree and knocks down a swarm of {{p|Beedrill}} while trying to get some of the fruit. Autumn tries to protect Ilta from the oncoming swarm as Happiny saves the day with a {{m|Secret Power}}. After escaping Ilta gives Autumn a lick on the face seeing how courageous Autumn was. Suddenly, Team Rocket appears, and captures both Ilta and Autumn. Seeing this, Brock jumps onto the net, so Team Rocket grabs him and Happiny as well. Team Rocket puts all of them in a cage, as they want some milk from Ilta, who refuses. Happiny is able to put Team Rocket to sleep with Secret Power, so they drop the key and everyone escapes. Wobbuffet later wakes Team Rocket up and they see that Autumn, Brock, Ilta, and Happiny got away.\n\nTeam Rocket immediately starts to chase them, finally catching up and sending out their Pokémon. Ash and Dawn, seeing that Team Rocket have caught Brock and Autumn, catch up. Ash sends out Turtwig, commanding it to use Energy Ball, but Energy Ball hadn\'t been perfected yet. Before Dawn could help, Brock decides that he and Autumn should [[Multi Battle|Tag Battle]] to strengthen the bond between them and their Pokémon. Fortunately they win and Team Rocket blasts off.\n\nBack at the barn, Ilta happily straps herself into the machine to give Autumn some milk. Autumn thanks Brock, who goes over to her sisters, and Croagunk drags him away. Finally, Ash and friends say goodbye to the Maid Café, with some last reassuring words from Brock to Autumn. However, when the sisters told them to come back any time, Brock nearly went back to them immediately, but Ash and Dawn drag him off. Autumn looks lovingly at Brock as Ash and friends walk off down the road and toward Veilstone City and Ash\'s next Gym Battle.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{an|Brock}}\'s {{TP|Brock|Happiny}} learns {{m|Secret Power}} and is also revealed to know {{m|Pound}}.\n* [[Ash\'s Turtwig]] continues to learn {{m|Energy Ball}}.\n* {{an|Dawn}} begins to suffer a lack of confidence after her recent [[Pokémon Contest]] losses.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Zoey]] (flashback)\n* {{OBP|Autumn|DP062}}\n* {{OBP|Spring and Summer|DP062|Summer}}\n* {{OBP|Spring and Summer|DP062|Spring}}\n* Customers\n* {{jo|Marina}} (cameo)\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Piplup}} ({{OP|Dawn|Piplup}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Staravia}} ({{OP|Ash|Staravia}})\n* {{p|Turtwig}} ({{OP|Ash|Turtwig}})\n* {{p|Chimchar}} ({{OP|Ash|Chimchar}})\n* {{p|Buizel}} ({{OP|Ash|Buizel}})\n* {{p|Buneary}} ({{OP|Dawn|Buneary}})\n* {{p|Pachirisu}} ({{OP|Dawn|Pachirisu}})\n* {{p|Ambipom}} ({{OP|Dawn|Ambipom}})\n* {{p|Sudowoodo}} ({{OP|Brock|Sudowoodo}})\n* {{p|Croagunk}} ({{OP|Brock|Croagunk}})\n* {{p|Happiny}} ({{OP|Brock|Happiny}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Carnivine}} ({{OP|James|Carnivine}})\n* {{p|Miltank}} ({{OBP|Autumn|DP062}}\'s; Ilta)\n* {{p|Miltank}} ({{OBP|Spring and Summer|DP062|Spring}}\'s; ×2)\n* {{p|Miltank}} ({{OBP|Spring and Summer|DP062|Summer}}\'s)\n* {{p|Beedrill}} (multiple)\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:Ash crossdressing DP.png|thumb|200px|Ash crossdressing]]\n* [[Professor Oak\'s Big Pokémon Encyclopedia]]: {{p|Probopass}}\n** Pokémon senryū: ダイノーズ しんかするなら テンガンざん \'\'Dainōzu, shinka suru nara, Tengan-zan.\'\' "{{tt|Dainose|Probopass}}, if it\'s going to evolve, [[Mt.
