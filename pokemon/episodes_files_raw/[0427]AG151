It was first broadcast in Japan on November 10, 2005 and in the United States on September 23, 2006.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/09_06-weekend-warrior/-->\n<i>It's time for the Silver Town Pokémon Contest, and May is ready to win! As the show starts, one last competitor arrives late: a businessman named Jeremy. He doesn't look like much, but after May makes her big entrance with Squirtle, she's surprised to see Jeremy dressed up like a rock star onstage with Butterfree! However, Jeremy's wife and son show up and demand that he stop his embarrassing Contest antics.\n\nWith encouragement from May, Jeremy stands up to his family and explains how important Contests are to him. No matter what, he's going to compete! Both May and Jeremy make it to the finals, but will Jeremy's family come back to watch? Outside the Contest, his wife remembers how she met him back when he was a real musician. As she reminisces, she starts to think what Jeremy's doing isn't so silly after all.\n\nBack at the Contest, Jeremy sends his trusty Venusaur to battle May's Combusken. As a Fire-type Pokémon, Combusken should have the advantage, but Venusaur is too tough to be defeated that easily. Venusaur also has a powerful Frenzy Plant attack, and soon May is losing points fast. She risks it all on one last Sky Uppercut and Combusken knocks Venusaur out just before time is up. Victory goes to May! And Jeremy may not have won the ribbon, but his family finally respects him as a Pokémon Coordinator. A happy ending all around—except for Team Rocket, who goes hunting for berries and finds Beedrill instead!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{an|May}} prepares her team for the upcoming {{ka|Silver Town}} [[Pokémon Contest]] when she loses {{TP|May|Squirtle}} backstage. During her search, May approaches {{OBP|Mandy|AG151}} and her son {{OBP|Nicholas|AG151}} for insight. However they admit they haven't seen Squirtle, and rush off to continue their own search for someone themselves. Just then, {{Ash}}, {{an|Brock}}, and [[Max]] appear, to which May explains that she's lost Squirtle. Brock smiles and tells her that Squirtle is right here. At this, Squirtle appears from behind Brock's leg wearing lots of flowers, much to May's delight.\n\nOutside, [[James]] points out [[Media:Silver Contest poster.png|a poster]] for the Silver Town Contest. Surprisingly [[Jessie]] isn’t interested, admitting that there's more important things to do right now like running their [[Pokéblock]] shop.\n\nBack in the Contest Hall, [[Lilian Meridian|Lilian]] warms up the gathered audience with her opening speech and presents the three judges; Chief of the [[Pokémon Activities Committee]], [[Raoul Contesta]]; the [[Pokémon Fan Club Chairman|Head]] of the [[Pokémon Fan Club]], [[Mr. Sukizo]]; and the [[Pokémon Center Nurse|operator]] of Silver Town's [[Pokémon Center]], [[Nurse Joy]]. Next, she calls all of the participating {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s onto the stage. Just as Lilian is about to get the Contest underway, an assistant man runs up to Lilian and whispers something in her ear. Lilian nods and then tells the audience that one of their Coordinators is a little late. Then the Coordinator in question, wearing a suit and carrying a heavy bag, bursts through the door and tells her to stop, worried that he's been disqualified for being late. Lilian asks if he is {{OBP|Jeremy|AG151}}, and he says that he is. He apologies over and over for being late, and Lilian says that it's okay, and directs him to line up with the other Coordinators. However, he trips causing the audience to laugh. May smiles, knowing the embarrassment of doing something like that.\n\n[[File:May Squirtle Appeal AG151.png|thumb|220px|Squirtle finishing its performance]]\nLilian then starts the [[Appeal|Appeals Round]]. May is introduced and allowed to do her appeal. May starts things off by sending out Squirtle. As soon as Squirtle comes out of its {{i|Poké Ball}}, it starts to use {{m|Ice Beam}} while spinning around rapidly. This creates a beautiful rain of sparkles which rain down on Squirtle as it lands and bows. May then orders Squirtle to use {{m|Bubble}}, and Squirtle does so, creating lots of beautiful bubbles surrounded by a large bubble. May calls for an Ice Beam. At this, Squirtle leaps onto the large bubble, bursting all of the smaller ones with an Ice Beam for a sparkling display before using Ice Beam on the huge bubble to create a large ice sculpture and finishing up by smiling and posing atop one of the ice pillars. The crowd claps loudly, and the judges are greatly impressed with the performance May delivered.\n\nLilian then asks for Jeremy to enter, and the crowd laughs, remembering his antics from before. The laughing stops however, when the lights go dim and rock music starts to play as Jeremy walks in wearing heavy metal gear with a pair of shades. Jeremy calls out his {{p|Butterfree}}, and orders it to use {{m|Stun Spore}} and {{m|Poison Powder}}, creating a huge wave of orange and purple pollen. The whole Hall is then lit up by a beautiful green light as Butterfree uses {{m|Safeguard}}. Jeremy’s performance is abruptly interrupted by his wife and son, whom May earlier encountered backstage. Mandy and Nicholas orders Jeremy return home immediately and save them the embarrassment. Jeremy tries to explain that being a Coordinator and entering Contests is a lifelong dream and something he enjoys doing. He prepares to take his family backstage to discuss further when May steps forward to support Jeremy. Mandy reiterates her negative sentiments, leading Jeremy to pipe up again, clarifying the effort needed to create a great performance, and become a great Coordinator. Jeremy bows to the audience, and asks them if they will forgive him and accept his appeal. One of the men in the crowd begins to clap, and the rest of the audience follow, all touched by his emotional speech.\n\nIn the Contest Hall, the next stage has begun as four contestants are chosen to do battle. May and {{TP|May|Combusken}} go up against a Coordinator and his {{p|Exeggutor}}, which she easily defeats with {{m|Fire Spin}}. Jeremy and his {{p|Venusaur}} also do well in their match, going up against a girl and her {{p|Vileplume}}. Jeremy's son watches the battle and is amazed by his father's battling skill. As Lillian announces that May and Jeremy have reached the finals, Nicholas rushes outside to his mother to inform her that dad is performing remarkably well. She doesn't look too happy, however, and her son tries to cheer her up. Mandy recalls when she first met Jeremy, back when he was in a traveling rock band. Thinking back all those years, and remembering her husband's love for Pokémon makes her realize and accept Jeremy's feelings.\n\nBack in the Contest Hall, the final round is about to begin. May sends out Combusken and Jeremy sends out Venusaur. Jeremy doesn't waste anytime, though, and orders Venusaur to use {{m|Razor Leaf}}. May has Combusken counter with Fire Spin, which burns Venusaur's leaves to ashes. Before the attack can get to Venusaur, Jeremy tells Venusaur to use {{m|Vine Whip}}. Venusaur fires its vines straight into the attack and ripping the flames apart. This attack lowers May's point's bar, much to her distress. Jeremy decides to get serious and has Venusaur summon a {{m|Frenzy Plant}}. A thorny vine forest takes over the battlefield, striking Combusken down and withering May's points to a quarter. May is taken aback, but regains her focus as Ash instructs her to look at Venusaur. After such a strong attack, it must recharge leaving it open to be attacked itself. Without a moment to spare, May orders {{m|Quick Attack}}, and then {{m|Peck}}. Combusken charges at Venusaur and then stabs away at its health. Jeremy grits his teeth as he remembers the draw-back to using Frenzy Plant. Jeremy risks it all with another Frenzy Plant. May tries to attack Venusaur with Combusken's Fire Spin, but the Frenzy Plant blocks the attack and rips through the air again towards Combusken. May orders Combusken to rush towards its opponent with a Quick Attack. Combusken fails to clear the thorny obstacles and is struck, reducing May's points to a dismal level. Even so, May orders Combusken to attack with {{m|Sky Uppercut}}. Combusken jumps onto one of the vines and runs straight at Venusaur. Reaching its target, Combusken uses Sky Uppercut on Venusaur and sends it crashing to the ground. With three seconds remaining, Venusaur is declared unable to battle and the crowd cheers.\n\nAll the Coordinators gather on the stage, and Lilian presents May with the Silver [[Ribbon]]. May celebrates with Squirtle and Combusken over their second [[Kanto]] Contest Ribbon. Outside the Contest Hall, Jeremy walks away before he is stopped by his wife and son. They congratulate him on such an awesome battle, though Jeremy is unsure of how to take their newfound appreciation. The three walk off together, ready for home. Meanwhile, Team Rocket’s search for Berries continues into the night. After Jessie mistakes a {{p|Beedrill}}'s stinger for a [[Berry]], she and her teammates are forced to flee from the angry swarm of Beedrill.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:May Silver Ribbon.png|thumb|220px|May holding the Silver Ribbon]]\n* {{an|May}} wins her second [[Kanto]] [[Ribbon]] in the {{ka|Silver Town}} [[Pokémon Contest]].\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* {{OBP|Jeremy|AG151}}\n* {{OBP|Mandy|AG151}}\n* {{OBP|Nicholas|AG151}}\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Lilian Meridian]]\n* [[Raoul Contesta]]\n* [[Mr. Sukizo]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* {{OBP|Jeremy|AG151}}\n* {{OBP|Mandy|AG151}}\n* {{OBP|Nicholas|AG151}}\n* {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s\n* {{pkmn|Contest}} audience\n* Concert audience\n* Jeremy's fellow band members\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Mime Jr.}} ({{OP|James|Mime Jr.}})\n* {{p|Combusken}} ({{OP|May|Combusken}})\n* {{p|Squirtle}} ({{OP|May|Squirtle}})\n* {{p|Ivysaur}} ({{OBP|Jeremy|AG151}}'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Venusaur}} ({{OBP|Jeremy|AG151}}'s)\n* {{p|Butterfree}} ({{OBP|Jeremy|AG151}}'s)\n* {{p|Vileplume}} (Coordinator's)\n* {{p|Exeggutor}} (Coordinator's)\n* {{p|Farfetch'd}} (Coordinator's)\n* {{p|Bellossom}} (Coordinator's)\n* {{p|Machop}} (Coordinator's)\n* {{p|Beedrill}} (×3)\n* {{p|Marill}}\n* {{p|Shroomish}}\n* {{p|Breloom}}\n* {{p|Quilava}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[Smile]] is used as background music in the ending scenes.\n* This is the first episode to use music from ''[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]'', at the start of the episode. However, the background music is replaced in the dub.\n* Despite the move existing since [[Generation I]], this is the first time the move {{m|Poison Powder}} is used in the {{pkmn|anime}}.\n* {{TRT}} doesn't recite their {{motto}} in this episode.\n* As a rocker in his youth, {{OBP|Jeremy|AG151}} bears a strong resemblance to {{an|Giovanni}}.\n** On another note, his other appearances look like other characters as well. He somewhat resembles [[Mr. Sukizo]] in his working clothes and [[Scott]] in his rocker clothes.\n\n===Errors===\n* A light-blue {{p|Marill}}, a blue-and-green {{p|Breloom}}, and a {{p|Shroomish}} with spots the same color as its head appear as extras. These are not {{Shiny}}, but rather just coloring errors, like {{p|Pidgey}} on the cuckoo clock in ''[[EP002|Pokémon Emergency!]]''.\n** In the same scene, a {{p|Linoone}} is shown in the background. Its body bears the {{Shiny}} Linoone stripes, but its main body is orange, which is also a possible coloring error.\n* When Jeremy tells {{p|Butterfree}} to use {{m|Poison Powder}} and then {{m|Stun Spore}}, Butterfree used Stun Spore before Poison Powder.\n** When Butterfree created the Poison Powder and Stun Spore, the Stun Spore came out of its left wing while the Poison Powder came out of its right wing. When Butterfree was about to merge the two powder moves, they swapped places.\n* In the Latin American and Dutch dub versions, Jeremy mentioned in his flashback that he had a Venusaur, but in the flashback he has an Ivysaur, its pre-evolution.\n\n<gallery>\nAG151 error.png|The coloring error\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=77FF77|bordercolor=55DD55\n|zh_cmn={{tt|對手是上班族！？|Opponent is an Office Worker!?}}\n|da={{tt|Weekendkriger|Weekend fighter}}\n|nl={{tt|Weekend Strijder|Weekend Warrior}}\n|de=Rock´n`Roll\n|fi={{tt|Viikonloppusoturi|The weekend warrior}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Coeur de rockeur|Heart of rocker}} {{tt|*|A pun on the song 'Coeur de rocker' by Julien Clerc}}\n|he={{tt|לוחם ליום אחד|A Fighter For One Day}}\n|hi=सिल्वर शहर का पोकेमोन कॉन्टेस्ट {{tt|''Silver Sheher ka Pokemon Contest''|Silver Town Pokémon Contest}}{{tt|*|Disney XD dub}}\n|it={{tt|La Gara della Città d'Argento|Silver Town Contest}}\n|ko={{tt|오늘의 상대는 회사원!?|Today's Opponent is an Office Worker!?}}\n|no={{tt|Helge-kriger|Weekend warrior}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Guerreiro do Fim de Semana|Weekend Warrior}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Guerreiro de Final de Semana|Weekend Warrior}}\n|ru={{tt|Рок-н-рольный поединок|Rock-n-roll duel}}\n|es_la={{tt|Guerrero de fin de semana|Weekend Warrior}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Fin de semana marchoso|Lively Weekend}}\n|sv={{tt|Fritidskrigare!|Free time warriors!}}\n}}\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=AG150 |\nprevtitle=May's Egg-Cellent Adventure |\nnextcode=AG152 |\nnexttitle=On Olden Pond |\nseries=Advanced Generation series|\ncolorscheme=Emerald }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0425}}\n[[Category:Advanced Generation series episodes|151]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Aya Matsui]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Yukihiro Shino]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Norihiko Nagahama]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Toshihito Hirooka]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Megumi Yamashita]]\n[[Category:Episodes by multiple animation directors]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which May gets a Ribbon]]\n[[Category:Episodes with Contests]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on May]]\n\n[[de:Rock 'n' Roll]]\n[[es:EP428]]\n[[fr:AG151]]\n[[ja:AG編第151話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 超世代 第150集]]"}
