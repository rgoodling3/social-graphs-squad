It first aired in Japan on November 4, 2018, in Canada on March 16, 2019, and in the United States on March 25, 2019.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/22_03-sparking-confusion/-->\n<i>The Ultra Guardians have been summoned to investigate unusual magnetic activity around Wela Volcano, where they discover a group of Alolan Geodude and Alolan Graveler munching on Spark Stones. But our heroes also find a group of rock hunters who are after the Spark Stones for themselves. The Ultra Guardians spring into action…but so does an enraged Alolan Golem, who sends the rock hunters packing! Thanks to the efforts of Sophocles’s friend Metang, the Golem eventually calms down—and it happily joins a group of Hikers who promise to keep watch over the volcano!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[Ultra Guardians]] are summoned by {{an|Lusamine}}, and [[Wicke]] explains that they detected strong magnetic reactions at the center of [[Wela Volcano Park]] on [[Akala Island]]. She adds that the force is quickly spreading and is interfering with the [[Aether Foundation]]\'s ability to detect Ultra Aura. The Ultra Guardians accept the mission and [[Poké Ride|fly over]] to Wela Volcano. There, {{an|Lillie}} and {{an|Sophocles}} take out sensors, and the Ultra Guardians split up into two groups: the boys ({{Ash}}, {{an|Kiawe}}, and Sophocles) investigate the mines; while the girls ({{an|Lana}}, Lillie, and {{an|Mallow}}) decide to scour the surface.\n\nThe boys soon get a signal, and they discover a group of {{alo|Geodude}} and {{p|Graveler}}. Sophocles points his sensor at the [[wild Pokémon]], which detects a massive magnetic force. {{Rotom}} affirms that the dual {{t|Rock}}- and {{type|Electric}}s radiate strong magnetism. {{AP|Pikachu}} rushes over to the Geodude and Graveler and returns to Ash side with a mysterious golden stone. Kiawe quickly confirms that the object is actually a Spark Stone, a magma-hardened and electricity-infused rock that is also Graveler and Geodude\'s favorite food. Kiawe clarifies that he hasn\'t seen this type of behavior before, and normally Geodude and Graveler live underground.\n\nSuddenly, a male {{pkmn|Trainer}} arrives and calls out his {{p|Pinsir}} to scare off the Graveler and Geodude. Another man appears, and with a pickax, he finds a large amount of Spark Stones. Kiawe decides to confront [[Rock hunters|the men]], but they dismiss his concerns and claim the Spark Stones are available to everyone. The situation quickly escalates into a {{pkmn|battle}}, as Pinsir approaches using {{m|Thrash}}. However, {{TP|Kiawe|Marowak}} gets in first and defeats Pinsir with one {{m|Flare Blitz}}. The men then flee into the mines, with Sophocles, Kiawe, and Ash in pursuit.\n\nInside the mine, they soon locate another two men who are in the middle of mining for Spark Stones. Ash, Kiawe and Sophocles look on in shock when suddenly the trio of Hikers from earlier appear behind them. The Hikers explain that the rock hunters are interested in making a profit from the Spark Stones, which can be turned into expensive jewelry. Kiawe is burning with intense anger, so the trio decide to continue their search for the rock hunters. They soon arrive at a dead end, but they can hear noises on the other side. Sophocles\'s {{p|Metang}} makes quick work of the obstacle and the boys enter into a well-lit cavern. However, the intensity of the heat overwhelms Rotom and the group spot the guys and Pinsir from earlier lying unconscious on the rock floor. The boys manage to wake up the two rock hunters who go on to explain that they were attacked by a boom and zap. Ash and his friends are unable to figure out what the pair means, but soon the odd sound occurs again and causes a rock to fall. Kiawe has his Marowak use {{m|Bonemerang}} to successfully deflect the debris.\n\nA group of angry Geodude and Graveler appear, and their leader, a {{p|Golem}} goes onto unleash another attack as the two rock hunters flee the chaos. Ash and his friends are also forced to run as Golem continues to attack. Marowak later attempts to intervene, but is struck down by the explosive force of Golem\'s [[move]]. With Marowak severely injured, Ash and Sophocles send out Pikachu and {{TP|Sophocles|Togedemaru}} to confront the rampaging horde. Pikachu goes in for an {{m|Iron Tail}} and Togedemaru attempts a {{m|Zing Zap}}. Unexpectedly, Golem picks up one of the Geodude and launches it directly at Pikachu and Togedemaru. Golem is spurred into a maniacal mood and begins shooting more Geodude at the mine walls. Golem then turns its attention to Ash and Sophocles and fires another Goedude directly at them. Fortunately Metang intervenes and strikes Golem several times with its clawed arms. Golem and Metang exchange intense stares, and before long the pair engage in a test of strength against each other as Ash\'s side and the Geodude and Graveler spur on the competitors. Golem sees its opportunity and punches Metang into the cave\'s ceiling. Metang quickly recovers itself and reveals its brand new iron sand eyebrows and mustache. Golem feels it face for a moment and quickly realizes it is missing it distinct facial features. The Geodude and Graveler quickly switch sides and cheer for Metang as Rotom explains that the Geodude line value the iron sand features as an indicator of strength and leadership. Golem is frustrated, so Metang returns the iron sand fragments back to it in the form of a mohawk. Metang continues to attract and repel the iron sand from itself and Golem, showing off various facial hair styles. Golem collapses in exhaustion and Metang is declared the winner. As a gesture of goodwill, Metang restores Golem\'s iron sand facial features to its original style. Rotom takes a commemorative photograph of Metang and Golem for its own database.\n\nAsh, Sophocles and Kiawe reunite with the girls and report to Lusamine that the rock hunters\' excavations for Spark Stones led the Geodude and Graveler to flee to the surface and hence the drastic increase of magnetic activity around Wela Volcano. Lusamine is grateful for the Ultra Guardians\' efforts and states that she will organize patrols for the Wela Volcano area. The Hikers overhear the conversation and volunteer themselves as patrol agents. The Golem from before then reappears, and, in a strange turn of events, lets itself be {{pkmn2|caught}} by the Hikers. The trio of Hikers are overjoyed as they, their {{p|Magmar}}, and their new Golem happily dance around in a circle.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
