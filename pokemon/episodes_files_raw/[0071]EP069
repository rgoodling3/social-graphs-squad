It first aired in Japan on November 5, 1998 and in the United States on October 8, 1999.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/02_15-lights-camera-quack-tion/-->\n<i>A famous movie director comes to town and everybody wants to be the star. Since he only wants Pokémon in his movie, Ash, Brock, Misty and Team Rocket fight hard to make sure it\'s their Pokémon that will star opposite Wigglytuff.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} are at a campsite, training for the [[Pokémon League]], when they meet a {{pkmn|Trainer}} named {{OBP|Katrina|EP069}}. Though {{an|Brock}} tries to make an advance, Ash quickly accepts an offer to battle her {{p|Raichu}} with {{AP|Pikachu}}. However, before the battle begins, {{TRT}} suddenly appears with a net in an attempt to steal Pikachu, but they catch Raichu instead. After they realize this, Raichu breaks free, and uses a {{m|Thunderbolt}} and {{m|Mega Kick}} to knock Team Rocket over. As they are preparing to send Team Rocket flying, a voice yells, "Cut!" It turns out that during this entire exchange, they had been filmed without their knowledge by a producer.\n\nThe producer introduces himself (in the style of Team Rocket\'s {{motto}}, much to their bewilderment) as [[Cleavon Schpielbunk]], an acclaimed director. Though Ash and {{an|Misty}} had never heard of him, Brock easily recognizes him as the producer of his favorite movie \'\'{{DL|Movies in the Pokémon world|I Saw What You Ate Last Tuesday}}\'\'. Schpielbunk reveals he is in the area to cast a {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} for his all-Pokémon production, \'\'{{DL|Movies in the Pokémon world|Pokémon in Love}}\'\', after his male lead, an {{p|Abra}}, had {{m|teleport}}ed off the set over its costar, a {{p|Wigglytuff}} with a prima-donna attitude. Everyone is interested in being part of the movie, and send out their Pokémon to audition, including Pikachu, Raichu, {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}}, {{TP|James|Weezing}}, {{MTR}}, {{TP|Brock|Vulpix}}, and {{TP|Misty|Psyduck}} (though Misty originally wanted {{TP|Misty|Staryu}}). The Pokémon easily pass though after showing off their dancing skills.\n\nThen, Schpielbunk wants the Pokémon to {{m|sing}}. However, as if on cue, {{an|Jigglypuff}} appears and puts everyone to sleep. After waking up, Schpielbunk wants everyone to sing with Wigglytuff. When Meowth mentions to her that he works alone, he and Team Rocket\'s other Pokémon are attacked with {{m|Double Slap}}. As a result, an enraged Team Rocket leaves to comfort their Pokémon. After realizing that the show business is tough, Pikachu, Raichu, and Vulpix dejectedly leave the stage. Only Psyduck, who Misty claims is too stupid to get off the stage, gets the part. Brock comes to Psyduck\'s defense and claims that it was only acting stupid.\n\nLater, Brock asks Schpielbunk for a plot summary of \'\'Pokémon in Love\'\', and learns that Psyduck and Wigglytuff are lovers who are caught in a family feud between Psyduck\'s fellow {{type|Water}}s and Wigglytuff\'s {{type|Normal}}s. However, just as the movie reaches a climactic battle, ruffian {{type|Fighting}}s appear, and a stray arrow hits Psyduck, fatally wounding him. The family feud ends after Wigglytuff shows remorse over Psyduck\'s death. While Brock is amazed at Schpielbunk\'s brilliance, Misty claims that it isn\'t original at all, instead being similar to \'\'{{wp|Romeo and Juliet}}\'\'. Despite this, Ash and his friends agree to assist the production. Meanwhile, Team Rocket begins plotting their revenge on behalf of their Pokémon.\n\nSchpielbunk begins filming by shooting the climactic scene, with Staryu providing rain effects, {{AP|Pidgeotto}} providing wind effects, and Pikachu and Raichu among the large mass of Normal and Water types for thunder effects, as Pikachu and Raichu have their respective groups attack each other. However, as Wigglytuff and Psyduck prepare to enter the fray, Pikachu is thrown into Wigglytuff, and it responds adversely. Just then, smoke fills the area and Team Rocket appears. However, this only causes all of the Pokémon to turn their attention on Team Rocket. Schpielbunk then orders his crew to join the brawl.\n\nAsh and his friends take the opportunity to pose in front of the now-unattended camera, but they refocus when Team Rocket gets the upper hand and kidnaps all of the Pokémon, except Psyduck, with the help of a large magnet on a crane. As both Misty and Wigglytuff prompt Psyduck to take action, Psyduck manages to snap and, in his brief moment of Psychic powers, uses {{m|Confusion}} to free everyone and send Team Rocket flying. As Psyduck passes out from exhaustion, Wigglytuff comes over to him, concerned, while Ash leads all of the Pokémon to cheer for Psyduck.\n\nThat night, Ash is worried as another day was wasted from not training, but Brock and Misty console him. Schpielbunk then expresses his belief that Ash\'s adventures would be great movie material, and that any male lead would have plenty of female fans. This piques Brock\'s interest and he immediately tries to sign up. Meanwhile, Wigglytuff and Psyduck are alone by the lake, while Team Rocket are precariously stuck in a tree over a steep descent.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

In the original, he just said he was a two-time winner at the {{an|Seafoam Island|Binnes}} Film Festival.\n* In the English dub, \'\'{{DL|Movies in the Pokémon world|I Saw What You Ate Last Tuesday}}\'\' is a reference to the movie \'\'{{wp|I Know What You Did Last Summer}}\'\'. Originally, the film that Brock liked was called \'\'There\'s Nothing I Like More Than Breakfast\'\'.\n* Katrina has actually seen the aforementioned movie in the original, whereas in the dub, she says she "almost saw it".\n* In the dub, when the Pokémon were dancing, the [[Pokémon (Dance Mix)|Pokémon Dance Mix]] plays as background music. In the original, [[Lucky Lucky]] was played instead.\n* When Pikachu and Raichu simulate lightning for the climactic showdown, in the dub they both use {{m|Thunder Shock}}. In the original they both use {{m|Thunder}}.\n* Meowth\'s "two paws down" line in the dub is a reference to the film critics "{{wp|Gene Siskel|Siskel}} and {{wp|Roger Ebert|Ebert}}" who, in their show {{wp|At the Movies (U.S. TV series)|At the Movies}}, gave films either a "Two Thumbs up" or "Two Thumbs Down" review. In the original, he just says them blasting off is the same as always.\n* Misty\'s mention of Brock being a "great choice" for Schpielbunk\'s new movie was originally her requesting if she could be in it as well.\n* In the [[Pokémon in South Asia#Hungama TV|Indian Hungama TV dub]], Cleavon Schpielbunk\'s name was changed to {{wp|Karan Johar}}, a real-life Indian film director.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=AFA|bordercolor=FAA\n|zh_cmn={{tt|神奇寶貝電影|Pokémon Movie}}\n|ca={{tt|Llums, càmera i quacció!|Lights, camera, quacktion!}}\n|cs={{tt|Světla, kamera, akce!|Lights, camera, action!}}\n|da={{tt|Klar Til Optagelse|Ready For Shooting}}\n|nl={{tt|De Helden van het Witte Doek!|The Heroes of the Big Screen!}}\n|fi={{tt|Kuvaus, kamerat, kvaak!|Recording, cameras, quack!}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Lumière !
