It was first broadcast in Japan on December 21, 2000 and in the United States on November 3, 2001. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/04_21-the-grass-route/-->\n<i>En route to Ecruteak, Ash and company are caught by the sight of a Skiploom racing by. Following after it, they encounter its trainer, Ephram<!--(sic)-->. He and his Skiploom are training for the upcoming annual Grass-Type tournament, a contest for Grass Pokémon only. Confident he can win any local tournament, Ash decides he and Bulbasaur will enter as well. Ephram and his Skiploom train hard as the tournament quickly approaches. However, Ash doesn\'t think it is necessary for someone of his Pokémon prowess to prepare. Find out who triumphs as young Ephram and Ash face off in the final round of the tournament!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{an|Brock}} informs {{Ash}} that [[Ecruteak City]] is on the other side of the upcoming mountain, and the news instantly gets Ash hyped for his next [[Gym]] match. The group notices an array of {{type|Grass}} Pokémon around them, but a running {{p|Skiploom}} grabs their attention. Ash\'s group follows the Pokémon and soon encounters its {{pkmn|Trainer}}, a young boy named [[Ephraim]]. Ephraim introduces his Skiploom as "Skippy", and asks Ash if he is a Trainer, and Ash shows Ephraim his three [[Badge]]s as proof. Ephraim immediately challenges Ash to a {{pkmn|battle}} against one of his Grass-types, eager to train Skippy. Ash accepts, calling upon his {{AP|Chikorita}}. After a {{m|Tackle}} attack fails to work, Ephraim calls for Skippy to use its {{m|Double Team}}, and Chikorita is dazed by Skippy\'s speed. Ash orders Chikorita\'s to use {{m|Razor Leaf}}, which successfully knocks away the clones and hits the real Skippy. Ephraim watches as Skippy bounces back onto its feet and he orders a {{m|Leech Seed}}. Chikorita batters the seeds away with a {{m|Vine Whip}} before knocking Skippy out with a direct Tackle. Ash celebrates his victory, but Misty scolds him, saying he should be ashamed of how badly he hurt Ephraim\'s Skiploom. Skippy proves to be fine, and Ephraim invites the Trainers back to his house. \n\nAt his house, Ephraim introduces the group to [[Ephraim\'s parents|his parents]]. Ephraim\'s father reassures his son that even though he lost, at least he learned some valuable tricks from an experienced Trainer like Ash. He then offers Ash and his friends a place to stay for the night, and Ash happily accepts the kind offer. Misty then turns her attention to the flowers growing inside the house, and Ephraim\'s mother admits that the family\'s Grass Pokémon helped. Everyone goes outside to watch the Grass Pokémon water the fields of flowers and admire their peaceful natures. Ephraim is quick to add that Grass Pokémon can be tough as well. He then tells Ash that the reason he challenged him is because he and his Skiploom are training for the upcoming annual [[Grass Tournament]]. The Grass Tournament is a competition for Grass Pokémon only, with a large collection of [[Leaf Stone]]s as the prize. Confident he can win any "local" tournament, Ash decides he and his {{AP|Bulbasaur}} will enter as well. Meanwhile, {{TRT}} finds a flyer advertising the Grass Tournament and decides that they will also compete, in the hopes of winning the prize of Leaf Stones. [[James]] plans to use his {{Tp|James|Victreebel}}, but [[Jessie]], having no Grass-type Pokémon, considers having {{MTR}} [[List of Team Rocket\'s disguises|disguise himself]] as a {{p|Sunflora}}. That evening, Ephraim is seen training with Skippy and practicing their Double Team and speed [[move]]s. Misty asks Ash if he is planning to train, but Ash arrogantly replies that a small local tournament is far too easy for him, and he does not need to train. \n\nThe following day, the tournament begins. Ash is the first to battle, facing a Trainer with a {{p|Gloom}}. Ash and Bulbasaur manage to defeat their opponent with a single attack, advancing Ash to the next round. Ephraim\'s first round battle is against James, posing as "Mr. Semaj" and his Victreebel. Though intimidated at first, Ephraim and Skippy manage to easily take down Victreebel with {{m|Leech Seed}} followed by a {{m|Double Team}}. The moment he wins the match, Ephraim\'s parents rejoice over their son\'s accomplishment, much to Ephraim\'s embarrassment. \n\nAsh\'s second round battle is shown after, and he challenges Jessie and a disguised Meowth. Bulbasaur uses Razor Leaf, but the attack reveals Mewoth\'s true identity and Jessie\'s dishonesty. At this, the Team Rocket trio removes their disguises and recites their {{motto}}. The three try to steal the Leaf Stones, but Ash blasts them off with Bulbasaur\'s Vine Whip. Afterwards a montage is shown of Ash and Ephraim winning their rounds in the tournament with relative ease. \n\nThe final matchup is between Ephraim and Skippy versus Ash and his Bulbasaur. At first, Ash and Bulbasaur dominate the match, smashing through Skippy\'s Double Team offensives. After a few exchanges of attacks, Ash tells Ephraim he doesn\'t want to harm the Skiploom any more than necessary. Ephraim asks Skippy if it is okay to keep fighting or if it would like to stop. Skiploom affirms that it wants to continue, and Ephraim agrees and tells Skippy to do whatever it takes to win. At this, Skiploom unleashes a powerful {{m|Solar Beam}} attack, must to everyone\'s shock. This unexpected attack hits Bulbasaur directly and sends it flying. Bulbasaur is finished off with a {{m|Tackle}} attack from Skippy, winning Ephraim the match and the tournament. Later, as Ephraim is handed the trophy, Ash remembers that pride and power aren\'t the only things a Trainer needs to win a battle. After this lesson in humility, Ash, Misty, and Brock continue their journey.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and [[James]] enter the [[Grass Tournament]] but lose to [[Ephraim]].\n* [[Ash\'s Bulbasaur]] is revealed to know {{m|Take Down}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Skiploom}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n[[File:Dare da EP178.png|thumb|200px|right|{{tt|Dare da?|Who\'s That Pokémon?}}]]\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Ephraim]]\n* [[Ephraim\'s parents]]\n* Competitors\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP EP178.png|thumb|200px|right|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Girafarig}} \'\'(US and international)\'\', {{p|Skiploom}} \'\'(Japan)\'\'\n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Togepi}} ({{OP|Misty|Togepi}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Bulbasaur}} ({{OP|Ash|Bulbasaur}})\n* {{p|Chikorita}} ({{OP|Ash|Chikorita}})\n* {{p|Victreebel}} ({{OP|James|Victreebel}})\n* {{p|Skiploom}} ([[Ephraim]]\'s; Skippy; debut)\n* {{p|Bellossom}} ([[Ephraim\'s parents]]\')\n* {{p|Hoppip}} ([[Ephraim\'s parents]]\'; ×2)\n* {{p|Sunflora}} ([[Ephraim\'s parents]]\'; ×2)\n* {{p|Oddish}} (Trainer\'s)\n* {{p|Gloom}} (Trainer\'s)\n* {{p|Vileplume}} (Trainer\'s)\n* {{p|Paras}} (Trainer\'s)\n* {{p|Bellsprout}} (Trainers\'; ×2)\n* {{p|Weepinbell}} (Trainer\'s)\n* {{p|Exeggutor}} (Trainer\'s)\n* {{p|Tangela}} (Trainer\'s)\n* {{p|Bellossom}} (Trainer\'s)\n* {{p|Hoppip}} (Trainer\'s)\n* {{p|Oddish}} (×2)\n* {{p|Gloom}}\n* {{p|Bellsprout}} (×2)\n* {{p|Sunflora}} (×2)\n\n==Trivia==\n* This episode is listed on Viz\'s [[Pokémon Elements]] page as "The Grass Ro\'\'\'o\'\'\'t".\n* The names [[Jessie]] and [[James]] go by in the tournament are their own names spelled backwards; Eissej and Semaj.\n* This episode is featured on the \'\'Volume 1: Grass\'\' copy of \'\'[[Pokémon Elements]]\'\'.\n* The trumpet fanfare James plays for Jessie\'s entrance is "{{wp|Reveille}}".\n* This is the second time when {{MTR}} dresses up as a {{p|Sunflora}}, the first time being in \'\'[[EP135|Grin to Win!]]\'\'.\n\n===Errors===\n* When this episode\'s title is shown, the [[Pokémon]] logo is missing.\n\n<gallery>\nEP178 Error.png|The missing logo\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n* The original airing of this episode on Hungama TV in {{pmin|India}} started it directly from the title card, skipping the part of the episode that comes before it.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|bg={{tt|Пътеката на растенията|The path of plants}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|毽子花，草神奇寶貝戰鬥|Skiploom, Grass Pokémon Battle}}\n|cs={{tt|Travnatá cesta|The grass route}}\'\'\'\n|nl={{tt|De Gras Route|The Grass Route}}\n|de={{tt|Das Pflanzen-Pokémon Turnier|The grass-Pokémon tournament}}\n|fi={{tt|Ylpeys vai lankeemus?|Pride or prejudice?}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Dernière escale|Last stop}}\n|he=טורניר העשב{{tt|turnir ha\'esev|The Grass Tournament}}\n|hi=ग्रास पोकेमोन {{tt|\'\'Grass Pokemon\'\'|Grass Pokemon}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n|it={{tt|Un torneo speciale|A special tournament}}\n|pl={{tt|Lekcja trawiastego Pokémona|Grass Pokémon\'s lesson}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Onde a Grama é Mais Verde|Where the Grass is Greener}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡La ruta de hierba!|The grass path!}}\'\'\'\n|es_eu={{tt|Campeonato de Pokémon planta|Grass Pokémon championship}}\n|sv={{tt|Högmod går före fall|Pride comes before a fall}}\n}}\n\n<br>\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP177 |\nprevtitle=Wings \'N\' Things |\nnextcode=EP179 |\nnexttitle=The Apple Corp |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Johto | }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0178}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|178]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Shinzō Fujita]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Osamu Inoue]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Toshiaki Suzuki]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Izumi Shimura]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Ash]]\n[[Category:Milestone episodes]]\n\n[[de:Das Pflanzen-Pokémon-Turnier]]\n[[es:EP180]]\n[[fr:EP178]]\n[[it:EP178]]\n[[ja:無印編第178話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第179集]]'}
