Fossil Pokémon!\'\') is the 46th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on May 28, 1998 and in the United States on February 27, 1999.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/01_43-attack-of-the-prehistoric-pokemon/-->\n<i>Our heroes approach Grampa Canyon, famous for the beautiful scenery of its valley. As they approach, however, they find wave upon wave of people also heading for Grampa Canyon. Carrying backpacks, pickaxes, etc. they are all dressed like explorers. Ash has no idea what is so special about the canyon, but he notices a familiar face among the crowd—that of his rival, Gary. According to Gary, fossils from an extinct Pokémon have been discovered, triggering an ancient Pokémon excavation boom.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} are walking in an area called [[Grampa Canyon]] when they see a large group of people walking with picks and shovels. {{Gary}} appears and explains that he and the group are here for the Fossil Rush, because of a great discovery. Ash decides to join, so as to embarrass Gary by finding a [[Fossil]] before he does. {{an|Jigglypuff}} also appears, ready to {{m|sing}}, but the group leaves without noticing it.\n\nAsh, {{an|Misty}}, and {{an|Brock}} soon find a large area of the canyon where many people, including Gary, are digging. However, they also stumble across {{TRT}}, who accidentally reveals their plan to blow up the canyon and steal all of the [[Fossil]]s. Misty and Brock run off to alert everyone to the danger, and Ash agrees to handle Team Rocket. As {{MTR}} lights the fuse, Ash runs up to Team Rocket and sends out {{AP|Squirtle}} in an attempt to put the flame out. Squirtle, {{AP|Pikachu}}, and Ash chase the fuse, trying to put it out; [[Jessie]], [[James]], Meowth, {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}}, and {{TP|James|Weezing}}) try to stop him. Team Rocket then falls and starts rolling, resulting in a ball of people and {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} rolling into Ash, landing right beside the dynamite. As the fuse draws near to the dynamite, Pikachu panics and uses {{m|Thunder Shock}}, causing the dynamite to detonate. The blast opens up a giant fissure in the ground, which disturbed rocks soon fill. Ash, Pikachu, Team Rocket, and their Pokémon are now trapped in an underground cave, and only Squirtle escapes from the rubble. Hearing the explosion, Misty and Brock run over and start digging out rock and soil with Squirtle.\n\nIn the cave, Ash, Pikachu, Team Rocket, and their Pokémon start to argue. Then, they soon notice that they are surrounded by mysterious glowing eyes and fall silent. Ash checks his [[Pokédex]] for details, and the Pokémon are revealed to be {{p|Omanyte}}, {{p|Omastar}}, {{p|Kabuto}}, and {{p|Kabutops}}. Jessie and James begin to speculate that the explosion must have awakened them from thousands of years of sleep. Regardless, Team Rocket begin to contemplate stealing the Pokémon for {{an|Giovanni|their boss}}, and attempt to {{pkmn2|caught|catch}} them by throwing {{i|Poké Ball}}s at the Fossil Pokémon. A Kabutops blocks the balls, and they are rebounded at Meowth. All of the Fossil Pokémon start approaching the group to attack, so Ash sends out his {{AP|Charmeleon}}, but it refuses to help. A chase scene ensues, where the Fossil Pokémon are winning the chase. Then, all of a sudden, the Pokémon run away deeper into the cave. Originally confused, the group soon realize why, and an {{p|Aerodactyl}} swoops in, knocking over Charmeleon. Angry, Charmeleon tries to attack the Aerodactyl, but is knocked out before it gets a chance. Aerodactyl then grabs onto Ash with its claws, and begins to fly towards the surface. Before the {{type|Flying}} Pokémon can get too far, Pikachu and Charmeleon jump on board.\n\nBack above ground, [[Brock\'s Geodude]] had finally dug a hole through the rubble. The Aerodactyl flies out of the hole in the ground, dropping Pikachu and Charmeleon on its way out, and perches on a cliff with Ash still in hand. Charmeleon wants to {{pkmn|battle}} the Aerodactyl out of revenge, but the Aerodactyl just taunts it. Fueled with anger, Charmeleon [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{AP|Charizard}}. Ash is happy, as he thinks that Charmeleon has evolved to rescue him. Unfortunately, he soon realizes Charizard merely wants to battle Aerodactyl for his own pride and has no intention of rescuing Ash.\n\nMeanwhile, Misty sees {{an|Jigglypuff}} and tells it to sing its slumber song to make Aerodactyl fall asleep. Jigglypuff agrees and quite happily sings, sending everyone in the canyon to sleep. Aerodactyl, now asleep, falls into the rubble, dropping Ash before plummeting. Luckily, Charizard manages to stay awake by covering its ears and catches the sleeping Ash before he hits the ground. However, he also falls asleep after landing. Ash rolls off of Charizard, landing next to a [[Pokémon Egg]]. Jigglypuff, seeing everyone has fallen asleep, draws markings on their faces out of spite. After awakening, Officer Jenny announces that the whole incident was a dream caused by Jigglypuff\'s song, although Ash knows it wasn\'t. In addition, Jenny announces that paleontological work will no longer be permitted, as any further digging may lead to more cave-ins and the eventual collapse of the entire canyon.\n\nAs Ash and the gang leave, Ash takes the Egg out of his [[bag|backpack]], revealing that he had found it at the site. This causes the trio to fight playfully about who should get to raise and keep the Egg. Brock takes the Egg and runs away, promising to take good care of it, with Ash and Misty in tow. Meanwhile, Team Rocket and their Pokémon remain trapped in the cave, with the sleeping Fossil Pokémon only a few feet away.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

That hadn\'t happened since \'\'[[EP021|Bye Bye Butterfree]]\'\' and won\'t happen again until \'\'[[DP064|Riding the Winds of Change!]]\'\'.\n* Two books are at least partially based on this episode. {{book|Attack of the Prehistoric Pokémon}} is a standard book in the novelization series; however, there is also {{OBP|Attack of the Prehistoric Pokémon|picture book}} in the Adventure series.\n* This episode is featured on \'\'Volume 3: Charizard\'\' from [[Viz Media]]\'s {{OBP|Pokémon All-Stars|Region 1}} series.\n* A shot of Aerodactyl performing an \'\'{{wp|akanbe}}\'\', which involves pulling its eyelid down and sticking out its tongue at the same time, is still present in the dub, despite similar shots being removed from \'\'[[EP006|Clefairy And The Moon Stone]]\'\' and \'\'[[AG002|A Ruin with a View]]\'\'.\n* Parts of this episode were reanimated and used for flashback material for \'\'[[BW116|The Fires of a Red-Hot Reunion!]]\'\'.\n\n===Errors===\n* When Gary comments on Ash being a "loser", his eyelid is colored white.\n* When the camera is panning over all of the Pokémon to show their red eyes, {{p|Kabuto}} is depicted with the colors of its claws and shell inverted.\n* {{AP|Pikachu}} uses an {{t|Electric}} attack on Kabutops; however, the Kabutops is unaffected as if it were a {{type|Ground}}, despite Kabutops being a {{t|Rock}}/{{type|Water}} and weak to electric attacks. This is most likely because during the first season, it is often incorrectly stated that Rock Pokémon are immune to Electric attacks.\n* When {{AP|Charizard}} fires its {{m|Flamethrower}} at Aerodactyl, the part of its wings that were previously colored blue are depicted in a yellow color.\n* When Ash rolls onto the [[Pokémon Egg]], all of its patterns are colored red, instead of half-red and half-blue.\n* When everyone is piled up upon each other before the dynamite hits, {{AP|Squirtle}}\'s eyes turn red.\n* When Ash commands Squirtle to put out the fuse, the buckle on Ash\'s belt is missing.\n* Also in the same shot, Ash\'s gloves are covering his fingers, the red dots on his shoes are gone, and Pikachu appears 1/3 of Ash\'s size instead of 1/4.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[PokéRap]]: Day 1 (Version 2)\n* The sign at the beginning of the episode states the name of the canyon in the Japanese version. In the dub, the sign is a picture of a pick-axe and shovel.\n** Similarly, the stage in {{an|Jigglypuff}}\'s fantasy originally had Kanji writing on it.\n* Gary originally asked what kind of Pokémon the fossil was rather than whether it was a fossilized brain.\n* {{MTR}} threatening to turn [[Jessie]] and [[James]] into fossils after emerging from rubble was originally him demanding to know whether they intended to turn him into a fossil.\n* The point where Meowth actually lights the fuse is cut in [[Pokémon in the United States|Kids\' WB!]] version of the dub. Instead, the camera zooms in to Meowth\'s face so the lighter isn\'t seen. This scene is uncut on the home video and streaming versions, as well as in the foreign dubs.\n* When digging through the rocks, Misty in the Japanese version says Ash had better not die on her. In the dub, she reminds him that he still owes her a bike.\n* The scene of Team Rocket singing a variation of "Rock-a-bye baby" to the sleeping Aerodactyl was originally them muttering their catchphrase.\n\n<gallery>\nEP046 error.png|Charizard\'s yellow wings\nEP046 Error 2.png|Gary\'s miscolored eyelid\nEP046 Error 3.png|Kabuto\'s color swap\nEP046 Error 4.png|The Egg\'s missing blue shapes\n</gallery>\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=AFA|bordercolor=FAA\n|zh_cmn={{tt|復活？化石神奇寶貝 / 复活？化石神奇宝贝|Revival?
