It first aired in Japan on November 14, 2002 and in the United States on October 25, 2003.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/06_12-hoenn-alone/-->\n\'\'Ash has left all of his Pokémon behind in Pallet Town—except Pikachu—and boarded a ship bound for Littleroot Town in Hoenn. Unfortunately, Team Rocket is on board as well, and they\'re cooking up a scheme to catch Pikachu once and for all. They nab Pikachu and hop off the boat just as it pulls into a port. Their plan quickly goes awry, and Meowth and Pikachu end up in a bad neighborhood. While Meowth and Pikachu team up to chase off a gang of territorial Haunter, Ash teams up with Officer Jenny to rescue Pikachu before the boat leaves.\'\'\n\n==Plot==\nAboard a large ferry, {{Ash}} and {{AP|Pikachu}} are on their way to the [[Hoenn]] [[region]]. As they have fun and discuss their upcoming adventures, Ash spots the {{OBP|Captain|EP274}} walking by and asks him when the ship will arrive in [[Littleroot Town]]. The Captain replies that they will arrive by tomorrow night. Meanwhile, {{TRT}} is watching from their hiding place inside a lifeboat, and start to discuss about stealing Pikachu.\n\nThat night, the trio uses their extendable grabber to snatch Pikachu from Ash\'s bed. He wakes up when Pikachu cries out, but by the time he gets out of his room, Team Rocket is nowhere to be seen. During his search, he bumps into the Captain, who uses a computer to scan the ship for stowaways. They discover Team Rocket eating in the food storage area while Pikachu is in an electricity-proof glass case. When they are discovered, they recite their {{motto}} before sending out {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}} and {{TP|James|Weezing}} to battle the Captain\'s {{p|Machoke}}. Ash intends to send out one of his Pokémon to help, but then, he remembers he left them all in [[Pallet Town]]. During the ensuing battle, Arbok\'s {{m|Acid}} melts a hole into the ship\'s water storage tank, and everyone is swept away in a torrent of water.\n\nThe Captain and Machoke manage to climb out of the water, where he reaches one of the help phones and orders the ship to the nearest port for repair. Team Rocket runs along the deck of the ship and launches a rope to a nearby crane, allowing them to swing to shore. As they are swinging Ash jumps and grabs onto {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}}, but they swing into the crane and all fall to the port below. Ash lands on some crates, breaking his fall. Jessie, [[James]] and Wobbuffet land on one truck, and {{MTR}} and Pikachu land on another. Both trucks then drive off, but they both go in different directions, splitting the groups up. Ash manages to break out of the crates just as [[Officer Jenny]] pulls up on her motorcycle and Ash explains what happened.\n\nMeanwhile, the truck which Meowth and Pikachu are on makes a sharp swerve, tossing them off near some warehouses. Pikachu\'s cage breaks opens, while Meowth sustains a head injury. While they are walking along, Meowth and Pikachu start to argue, but then a {{p|Haunter}} comes up behind them and attacks them with {{m|Night Shade}}. They both dodge it and Meowth retaliates with {{m|Fury Swipes}}, which just passes straight through it. Haunter uses another Night Shade, and Pikachu replies with a {{m|Thunderbolt}}s, which scares it off. Suddenly some {{p|Pidgey}}, {{p|Oddish}} and {{p|Rattata}} emerge from hiding and surround the pair.\n\nBack by the ship, Ash hops into Officer Jenny\'s sidecar, and they are ready to leave. The captain calls down to Ash that the tank should be fixed by nightfall, and that if he is not back by then they will be forced to leave without him. Jenny then sends her {{p|Pidgeot}} to look for Team Rocket.\n\nIn one of the warehouses, the Pokémon explain to Pikachu and Meowth that a group of Haunter had moved into the area and began scaring everyone. Meowth suggests that the Pokémon should fight back, but a Rattata adds that there are multiple Haunter.  Another Oddish rushes to its friends and informs everyone that Haunter is coming for them with all of its buddies. Elsewhere, Team Rocket is in their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|balloon]], and while James is searching for Meowth, Jessie is more interested in finding Pikachu. Back with Ash, Officer Jenny asks Ash about his Pikachu, and he details his strong [[friendship]] with Pikachu. Pidgeot seems to have spotted something and speeds up, and Officer Jenny follows.\n\nMeanwhile, the Haunter have shown up and tell the other Pokémon to get out of their turf. Meowth tries to back away from them and talk his way out of confrontation, but Pikachu bravely speaks up on behalf of the Pokémon. Meowth urges him to stop provoking the Haunter, but Pikachu insists that Ash would have done the same, and that it is the right thing to do. Haunter then launches a {{m|Shadow Ball}} at them, which they both dodge. Pikachu attempts a Thunderbolt, but the Haunter scatter to evade and quickly surround them. They Haunter lash out with a joint Night Shade, but Pikachu jumps onto Meowth to leap into the sky and avoid the attack. Pikachu follows up with a Thunderbolt, causing the Haunter to all flee. The Pokémon reappear and happy to have been rescued again. The Rattata and the others plead for Pikachu to stay with them for protection. However Meowth explains that Pikachu already has someone he needs to be with, but to Pikachu\'s surprise, Meowth claims that Pikachu is already Team Rocket’s property.\n\nJessie and James fly onto the scene with their balloon and trap Pikachu in a metal clamp. Meowth is pleasantly surprised, and soon Jessie hoists him up to the balloon. On Jessie\'s command, James reveals a hidden electromagnet, which instantly pins Pikachu to the device. Pidgeot shows up and pierces their balloon, causing it to crash to the ground. Officer Jenny rides into the scene, and soon enough Ash and Pikachu are reunited. Jenny scolds the trio for their attempted theft, however Jessie answers back before James reactivates the electromagnet. Ash tries to hold onto Pikachu, but he is knocked to the ground when an oil drum strikes him. The magnetic force has also exposed the Haunter group\'s hiding spot. Ash calls out to his friend, but Pikachu is stuck to the magnet’s surface and he is begin to feel pain as his electricity is drained from him. Ash and Jenny can\'t do anything, but one of the Rattata rushes in for a {{m|Hyper Fang}} and frees Pikachu from the metal clamp. Team Rocket runs after him, but the Haunter use Night Shade on the electromagnet, sending them blasting off. Afterwards, the Haunter and Rattata shake hands, as Ash cradles Pikachu.\n\nThe Captain regretfully looks over the port as the ship starts to sail off into the sunset. However, Officer Jenny\'s Pidgeot manages to deliver Ash and Pikachu onto the ship. That night, Pikachu is sleeping on Ash\'s bed while he is looking at him. Ash tucks Pikachu in, saying that he deserves a good rest. Meanwhile, the Rocket trio are pinned to the ship’s hull by their electromagnet and the metal remnants of their balloon.\n\nThe following day, the skyline of Littleroot Town is now in sight. Ash steps up on the deck in his new clothes and looks on, eager to reach Hoenn. Ash immediately spots some exotic Pokémon. Some {{p|Wingull}} and {{p|Pelipper}} fly alongside the ship, as several {{p|Sharpedo}} leap from the water and a pod of {{p|Wailmer}} swim alongside it. Ash rushes back to his cabin to check on Pikachu, hoping to show him some of the new Pokémon. However, Pikachu starts to spark and Ash realizes that he has a serious fever. Ash looks worriedly at Pikachu just as a new chapter in their journey together is about to begin.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} continues his {{pkmn|journey}} towards [[Hoenn]].\n* {{AP|Pikachu}} becomes ill.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Wingull}}\n* {{p|Pelipper}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n[[File:PMTV EP274.png|thumb|200px|right|{{tt|Pocket Monster TV|Who\'s That Pokémon}}]]\n* {{Ash}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Officer Jenny]]\n* {{OBP|Captain|EP274}}\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP EP274.png|thumb|200px|right|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Forretress}} \'\'(U.S. and international)\'\', {{p|Pikachu}} \'\'(Japan)\'\'\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Arbok}} ({{OP|Jessie|Arbok}})\n* {{p|Weezing}} ({{OP|James|Weezing}})\n* {{p|Pidgeot}} ([[Officer Jenny]]\'s)\n* {{p|Machoke}} ({{OBP|Captain|EP274}}\'s)\n* {{p|Haunter}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Rattata}} (×3)\n* {{p|Pidgey}} (×3)\n* {{p|Oddish}} (×3)\n* {{p|Wingull}} (multiple; cameo; debut)\n* {{p|Pelipper}} (multiple; cameo; debut)\n* {{p|Sharpedo}} (multiple; cameo)\n* {{p|Wailmer}} (multiple; cameo)\n\n==Trivia==\n* This is the last episode to air in Japan before the earliest release of {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}}.\n* The [[Who\'s That Pokémon?]] eyecatch ends in the original Japanese version with this episode. The segment continues in the [[dub]] until \'\'[[AG040|Watts with Wattson?]]\'\'. It returns in the dub starting with \'\'[[BW001|In the Shadow of Zekrom!]]\'\', and in the original version starting with [[BW061]].\n* The regular use of the original music of {{TRT}}\'s {{motto}} also ends with this episode. However, it has been reused in a few later episodes.\n* The usual \'\'To be continued\'\' title card is omitted and replaced with \'\'Next time... A new beginning!\'\', referencing the fact that the next episode begins the {{series|Advanced Generation}}. This starts the tradition for the [[AG192|three]] [[DP191|series]] [[BW142|finales]] that come after this to use it as well.\n* This is the first episode since \'\'[[EP001|Pokémon - I Choose You!]]\'\' in which {{Ash}} is the only human protagonist featured. While {{an|Misty}} did appear in the first episode, she was not featured, and no other protagonists had made their debuts. This is also the first episode to not have any protagonists other than Ash appear at all.\n** This is also the very first episode (and the only [[original series]] episode) where Misty does not appear, and the first episode since \'\'[[EP114|The Underground Round Up]]\'\' where {{an|Brock}} does not appear.\n* This episode marks the first time that Ash wears his {{series|Advanced Generation}} clothing.\n* This episode marks the longest time Ash goes without wearing his overshirt and hat. He spends the majority of the episode in his black undershirt, with the \'\'Advanced Generation\'\' orange stripe.\n* [[Jessie]] mentions that she has been to [[Littleroot Town]] before, but doesn\'t elaborate on the experience.\n* {{MTR}} mentions Ash by his real name and not "the twerp".\n* The English title is derived from the 1990 Christmas comedy film \'\'{{wp|Home Alone}}\'\'.\n* {{an|May}} narrates the preview for [[AG001|the next episode]].\n* The design of a background character in the episode is [[Anime character recycling|a recycling]] of [[Bill]]\'s.\n* On DVD releases of [[S05|Pokémon: Master Quest]], this episode is considered the season finale. However, on televised airings and [[Pokémon.com]], that title falls to \'\'[[EP262|You\'re a Star, Larvitar!]]\'\'.\n\n===Errors===\n* When Ash runs after {{AP|Pikachu}}, he doesn\'t have shoes on. When he gets out of the room, he is wearing shoes from that moment forward.\n* Ash and [[Officer Jenny]] both incorrectly call {{p|Pidgeot}} "Pigeon", which is the name of {{p|Pidgeotto}} in the Japanese version.\n** This was corrected in the {{pmin|Norway|Norwegian}} dub.\n* When Pikachu is sleeping, his right ear is vertical in one shot and horizontal in the next.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* The scene in which the boat approaches [[Littleroot Town]] and Ash discovers that Pikachu is sick plays as an epilogue after the credits in the original, whereas the scene was moved to before the credits in the dub.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|zh_cmn={{tt|與皮卡丘分手|Parting with Pikachu}}\n|da={{tt|Rejsen Til Hoenn-Regionen|The journey to the Hoenn region}}\n|nl={{tt|Alleen naar Hoenn!|Alone towards Hoenn!}}\n|de={{tt|Endlich in der Hoenn-Region|Finally in the Hoenn-region}}\n|fi={{tt|Yksin Hoennissa|Alone in Hoenn}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|En route pour Hoenn|On route for Hoenn}}\n|he=המסע להואן {{tt|\'\'Ha\'masa le\'Hoenn\'\'|The journey to Hoenn}}\n|hi=मैं चला Hoenn region! {{tt|\'\'Main chala Hoenn region!\'\'|I am going to the Hoenn region!}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n|it={{tt|Una nuova meta|A new goal}}\n|no={{tt|Hoenn alene!|Hoenn alone!}}\n|pl={{tt|Region Hoenn|Hoenn region}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Sozinho em Hoenn!|Alone in Hoenn!}}\n|pt_eu=Hoenn!\n|es_la={{tt|¡Solo en Hoenn!|Alone in Hoenn!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Solo en Hoenn|Alone in Hoenn}}\n|sv={{tt|Resan till Hoenn|The journey to Hoenn}}\n}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP273 |\nprevtitle=Gotta Catch Ya Later! |\nnextcode=AG001 |\nnexttitle=Get the Show on the Road! |\nseries=original series |\ncolorscheme=Johto}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0274}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|274]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Shinzō Fujita]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Yoshitaka Fujimoto]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Shigeru Ōmachi]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Hiroshi Sakai]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Ash]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Pikachu]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Officer Jenny]]\n[[Category:Milestone episodes]]\n\n[[de:Endlich in der Hoenn-Region]]\n[[es:EP276]]\n[[fr:EP274]]\n[[it:EP274]]\n[[ja:無印編第274話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第275集]]'}
