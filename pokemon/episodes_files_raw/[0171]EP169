Pokémon Beauty Contest!!\'\') is the 169th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on October 19, 2000 and in the United States on October 6, 2001. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/04_12-beauty-and-the-breeder/-->\n<i>Brock checks his e-mail at a local Pokémon Center and finds Suzy, the Pokémon breeder who gave Brock Vulpix, has contacted him regarding a Pokémon beauty contest. She is looking for a Pokémon to enter the contest with and Brock agrees to return her Vulpix. When they meet in the contest city of Bonitaville, Suzy suggests they enter the contest together. However, before the contest can commence, Team Rocket seize all the Pokémon! Will our heroes be able to track Team Rocket and return the bevy of Pokémon beauties?</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAs {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} rest up at a [[Pokémon Center]], {{an|Brock}} decides to check his email inbox. He finds an email from [[Suzie]] who is taking part in the [[Pokémon Beauty Contest]] in [[Bonitaville]], but she requires a Pokémon. Brock and his friends rush over to the event, and he begins grooming {{TP|Brock|Vulpix}} to be entered in the contest. However, {{TRT}} are there as well, they don some fashionable [[List of Team Rocket\'s disguises|Pokémon Stylist outfits]] and plan to enter the contest to become rich and famous.\n \nAs Ash’s group look for Suzie, Vulpix takes off and leads the group directly to her. Vulpix happily licks its Trainer’s face. Brock walks over and nervously gifts Suzie a bouquet of red roses. Brock also announces that he is happy to see that Vulpix is reunited with Suzie. She then invites Brock to enter the contest with her as partners, and Brock agrees before collapsing in embarrassment. Ash looks for {{an|Misty}}’s assistance with Brock, but she is too busy talking to a Trainer with a {{p|Ninetales}}. The young male is irritated by Misty’s questions, and Suzie calls for the Trainer by his name, [[Zane]], and tells him to be a little more polite. Zane immediately calms down and apologizes. Later he joins Ash’s group and Suzie for a tea break, where Suzie reveals that she and Zane have known each other since nursery school and are rivals in the stylist world. Zane has differing opinions on what makes a Pokémon beautiful, and considers their outside appearance to be more important. Though Suzie believes that a Pokémon\'s beauty comes from the inside. Zane soon leaves to continue preparing for the upcoming contest. Brock tells Suzie that they need to focus on their own entry and that Zane is their competition. Suzie nods in agreement.\n\n[[Jessie]] and [[James]] put the finishing touches on {{MTR}}’s look. Meowth looks into a mirror and begins to tear up at his transformation, but his teammates are quick to cover his mouth to avoid being discovered. Ash and Misty takes their seats in the audience, where they read the programme to see that Brock will be entry number 37, and Zane is directly after them. The announcer calls for entry number one to enter the stage. Though Team Rocket kidnap the young man and his {{p|Marill}} to take their place. The trio enters the stage with an extravagant display of groomed and painted Pokémon while reciting a variation of their {{motto}}. {{TP|James|Victreebel}}, {{TP|James|Weezing}}, {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}}, {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}}, and Meowth impress the crowd who eats it up until [[Officer Jenny]] is brought to the stage by the real first entrant. She throws them out because James runs his mouth. The contest continues as normal until Meowth tries his idea.\n\nLater, Jessie and James appear in the contestant waiting area dressed as doctors and tell everyone that the contest rules have changed and that every Pokémon needs an examination. All the Pokémon are corralled into a room and subsequently into a container being lifted by the [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|Rocket balloon]]. The contestants get worried and a group led by Zane starts to bang on the door demanding to see their Pokémon. Brock sends out his {{TP|Brock|Geodude}} and has it break down the door. Everybody rushes out to see Team Rocket trying to escape with their Pokémon. Ash sends out {{AP|Noctowl}} to pop Team Rocket\'s balloon, causing them to hit the ground. {{AP|Pikachu}} uses {{m|Thunderbolt}} to break the lock off the container and all of the Pokémon inside rush back to their Trainers. Jessie sends out her {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}} and James orders his {{TP|James|Victreebel}} to use {{m|Razor Leaf}}. As Ash tells Pikachu to get ready, Suzie\'s Vulpix and Zane\'s Ninetales use {{m|Flamethrower}} on Victreebel, burning the leaves and protecting Pikachu. Then both Vulpix and Ninetales use {{m|Fire Spin}}, sending Team Rocket blasting off again. Misty immediately notices Vulpix and Ninetales teamwork, while Brock realizes that Zane is a better match for Suzie.\n\nThe competition continues as normal with our heroes watching backstage. Zane admits it is important for Pokémon to look beautiful on the inside and outside. He then proposes opening a joint Pokémon beauty salon with Suzie. Everyone supports the idea, including Brock who ends his infatuation with Suzie. Brock and Suzie then bring out Vulpix for the contest, but the overall winner is left unknown.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} meet up with [[Suzie]] again.\n* {{an|Brock}} returns {{TP|Brock|Vulpix}} to Suzie.\n* Brock and Suzie enter the [[Pokémon Beauty Contest]], but it is not revealed whether they win or lose.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n[[File:Dare da EP169.png|thumb|200px|right|{{tt|Dare da?|Who\'s That Pokémon?}}]]\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Officer Jenny]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* [[Suzie]]\n* [[Zane]]\n* Competitors\n* Audience\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP EP169.png|thumb|200px|right|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Quagsire}} \'\'(US and international)\'\', {{p|Vulpix}} \'\'(Japan)\'\'\n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Togepi}} ({{OP|Misty|Togepi}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Noctowl}} ({{OP|Ash|Noctowl}}; {{Shiny}})\n* {{p|Geodude}} ({{OP|Brock|Geodude}})\n* {{p|Vulpix}} ({{OP|Brock|Vulpix}}; returned to [[Suzie]])\n* {{p|Arbok}} ({{OP|Jessie|Arbok}})\n* {{p|Weezing}} ({{OP|James|Weezing}})\n* {{p|Victreebel}} ({{OP|James|Victreebel}})\n* {{p|Ninetales}} ([[Zane]]\'s)\n* {{p|Marill}} (competitors\'; ×2; Entry #1)\n* {{p|Charizard}} (competitor\'s; Entry #36)\n* {{p|Pidgeot}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Raichu}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Sandshrew}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Clefable}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Wigglytuff}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Oddish}} (competitors\'; ×2)\n* {{p|Venonat}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Dugtrio}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Persian}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Psyduck}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Primeape}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Growlithe}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Poliwhirl}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Machoke}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Machamp}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Bellsprout}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Weepinbell}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Slowpoke}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Magnemite}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Dodrio}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Gengar}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Onix}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Drowzee}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Hypno}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Krabby}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Electrode}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Exeggutor}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Marowak}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Hitmonlee}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Hitmonchan}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Lickitung}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Chansey}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Tangela}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Goldeen}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Starmie}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Pinsir}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Tauros}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Hoppip}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Sunflora}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Wooper}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Heracross}} (competitor\'s)\n* {{p|Oddish}} (Trainer\'s)\n* {{p|Nidoran♀}}\n* {{p|Chansey}} (flashback)\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:Tracey look alike.png|thumb|200px|Tracey lookalike]]\n* {{an|Brock}} states that he always knew {{TP|Brock|Vulpix}} wasn\'t his and that he would have to return it one day, this episode being the moment.\n* This episode features a contest for {{tc|Pokémon Breeder}}s. It is very different from {{pkmn|Contest|those}} for [[Pokémon Coordinator]]s introduced [[Advanced Generation series|later on]].\n** [[Jessie]]\'s {{series2|Advanced Generation}} Contest costume is reminiscent of the one seen in this episode.\n* In this episode, Jessie and [[James]] disguise themselves as [[Pokémon Stylist]]s, an {{pkmn|anime}}-exclusive Trainer class which had not yet been introduced.\n* The {{p|Exeggutor}}\'s appearance may be a reference to [[Takeshi\'s Paradise]], where two identical-looking Exeggutor dance with Brock.\n* The white tuxedo Brock wears in this episode makes another appearance in \'\'[[EP198|The Heartbreak of Brock]]\'\'.\n* This episode\'s dub title is a reference to the popular French fairy-tale \'\'{{wp|Beauty and the Beast}}\'\'.\n** This fairy-tale is also referenced in the Japanese title for \'\'[[AG037|Jump for Joy!]]\'\' and the English dub titles for \'\'[[EP018|Beauty and The Beach]]\'\'.\n* In this episode, Team Rocket uses a {{DL|Team Rocket mottos|Beauty and the Breeder motto|variation}} of their motto.\n* Jessie and the announcer for the contest [[Breaking the fourth wall|break the fourth wall]] in this episode, with the latter saying that the audience will only find out who wins the contest "if you stay right where you are." Ironically, the TV audience never finds out who the winner is.\n* This episode is featured on the \'\'Crash of the Dairy\'\' volume of the High Voltage Collection series, a series of select Johto League Champions episodes on VHS.\n* Brock and [[Suzie]]\'s Vulpix is entry number 37, while [[Zane]] and his {{p|Ninetales}} are entry number 38 in the contest just as Vulpix is number 37 and Ninetales is number 38 in the [[List of Pokémon by National Pokédex number|National Pokédex]].\n* Suzie\'s original English voice actress, [[List of English voice actors|Leah Applebaum]], was replaced by [[Megan Hollingshead]] for this episode.\n* Meowth\'s make-up looks like a combination of {{wp|David Bowie}}\'s {{wp|File:DavisBowieAladdinSane.jpg|iconic lightning bolt makeup}} and {{wp|Paul Stanley}}\'s "{{wp|File:KISS starchild face.svg|The Starchild}}" makeup.\n* One of the beauty coordinators bears [[Doppelgänger|a striking resemblance]] to {{Tracey}}.\n\n===Errors===\n* The Pokémon that {{TRT}} steal are not dressed up, despite all the Pokémon entered, besides {{TP|Brock|Vulpix}} and {{p|Ninetales}}, being stylized for the contest. \n* Near the end of the episode, one contestant\'s {{p|Charizard}} has an orange belly.\n* When [[Zane]] tells {{an|Brock}} he was jealous when he met [[Suzie]], he refers to Suzie as a "he".\n* In the Italian dub, Suzie and Zane command their Vulpix and Ninetales to use {{m|Fire Blast}} together instead of {{m|Flamethrower}} against Team Rocket. In the next scene, Ash comments that it was a great {{m|Fire Spin}}.\n\n<gallery>\nEP169 Error.png|Charizard\'s miscolored belly\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n* The original airing of this episode on Hungama TV in {{pmin|India}} started the episode directly from the title card, skipping the part of the episode that comes before it.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|bg={{tt|Красавицата и възпитателя|Beauty and the breeder}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|再見了六尾，神奇寶貝選美比賽|Goodbye Vulpix, Pokémon Beauty Contest}}\n|cs={{tt|Kráska a chovatel|Beauty and the breeder}}\n|de={{tt|Die Schöne und der Züchter|The beauty and the breeder}}\n|nl={{tt|De Schoonheid en de Fokker|The Beauty and the Breeder}}\n|fi={{tt|Kauneus vaakakupissa|Beauty in the scale}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Le concours de beauté|The beauty contest}}\n|he=תחרות יופי{{tt|tacharut yofi|Beauty Contest}}\n|it={{tt|Il concorso di bellezza|The beauty contest}}\n|pt_br={{tt|A Beleza Põe a Mesa|Beauty Sets the Table}} {{tt|*|A pun on a Brazilian saying: Beleza não põe mesa (The Beauty doesn\'t set the table), which means that exterior beauty is not enough.}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|A Bela e o Criador|The Beauty and the Breeder}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡La bella y el criador!|The beauty and the breeder!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|La bella y el criador|The beauty and the breeder}}\n|sv={{tt|Skönhet kommer inifrån|Beauty comes from within}}\n|pl={{tt|Piękna i Brock|The beauty and the Brock}}\n|hi=Suzy - एक पोकेमोन ब्रीडर {{tt|\'\'Suzy - Ek Pokemon Breeder\'\'|Suzy - A Pokémon Breeder}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n}}\n\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP168 |\nprevtitle=Hook, Line, and Stinker |\nnextcode=EP170 |\nnexttitle=A Better Pill to Swallow |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Johto | }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0169}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|169]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Atsuhiro Tomioka]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Yoshitaka Fujimoto]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Toshiaki Suzuki]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Izumi Shimura]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a main character releases or gives away a Pokémon]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Brock]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which an alternately colored Pokémon appears]]\n\n[[de:Die Schöne und der Züchter]]\n[[es:EP171]]\n[[fr:EP169]]\n[[ja:無印編第169話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第170集]]'}
