It first aired in Japan on February 10, 2019 and in the United States on June 15, 2019.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/22_16-memories-in-the-mist/-->\n<i>As our heroes wrap up their Poni Island research projects, they become enveloped in a strange mist. Hapu says the mist, created by Tapu Fini, lets people and Pokémon reunite with loved ones who have passed on. Ash and Torracat meet up with Stoutland, and Mallow has an emotional reunion with her late mother. Worried about her friends, Hapu confronts Tapu Fini, who reunites her with her late grandfather and recognizes her as the new island kahuna! When the mist clears, Lillie and Gladion wonder why they didn’t see their late father—and they’re shocked when Hapu tells them that he must still be alive somewhere!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAs {{ashcl|the group}} admires {{an|Kiawe}}\'s new [[Flyinium Z]] from {{DL|Guardian deities (anime)|Tapu Fini}}, {{Ash}} spots a book on a nearby bookshelf, its front cover featuring the mysterious man he and Kiawe met yesterday. The pair takes a closer look, and [[Hapu]] says it is her grandfather [[Sofu]]. Hapu then explains the rumors that Tapu Fini has the ability to summon the spirits of the departed. The confession takes {{an|Mallow}} by surprise, though only {{an|Lana}} notices this. {{an|Lillie}} then adds that {{an|Gladion}} was hoping to see [[Mohn|their father]]. Hapu warns that people have not returned from Tapu Fini\'s mist, saying the prospect of meeting a loved one and having to say goodbye a second time may be too painful. When Mallow suddenly leaves, Lana explains [[Mallow\'s mother]] fell ill and passed away before leaving to find Mallow.\n\nMallow and Lana talk things over on a park bench. Mallow says she doesn\'t wish to see her mother again as she begins to reminisce about the past. While walking through a forest with her mother, who had recently left the hospital, they came across a {{pkmn2|wild}} {{p|Bounsweet}}, which Mallow\'s mother {{pkmn2|caught}} on her behalf. Soon after, Mallow\'s mother was readmitted to the hospital. Mallow tearfully admits that she declared her hatred for her mother\'s incessant apologies, and that it was the last thing she said to her before her mother passed away. Lana puts her arm around Mallow\'s shoulder and comforts her friend as Tapu Fini watches from afar. Later, Hapu leads everyone to her home at [[Ancient Poni Path]] for a visit. Mallow apologizes to {{TP|Mallow|Tsareena}} for worrying her and assures everyone else that she is fine.\n\nElsewhere, Gladion is busy {{pkmn|training}} his {{TP|Gladion|Silvally}} and {{TP|Gladion|Lycanroc}} when a peculiar mist begins to drift in. Hapu and the others find themselves caught up in it as well and are separated. Lillie soon finds Gladion within the mist. Hapu informs Kiawe, Lana, and {{an|Sophocles}} that this must be Tapu Fini\'s mist and that the others might be trapped within it. Meanwhile, Ash and {{AP|Torracat}} encounter the latter\'s old friend {{an|Stoutland}}, who teaches Torracat how to use {{m|Fire Blast}}. As for Mallow, she comes across her mother, embraces her, and tearfully apologizes for her last words to her, but her mother admits that she should have thanked her instead. The comments lead several [[Gracidea]] flowers to bloom around them, and Mallow thanks her mother for her life and the friend she has in Tsareena.\n\nMeanwhile, Hapu sets off on her {{p|Mudsdale}} alone in search of everyone else, but they instead reach the [[Ruins of Hope]]. Hapu dives into the rock pool and reaches the shrine altar to confront Tapu Fini. She orders it to return Ash, Lillie, and Mallow before it is too late, but becomes frustrated when the island guardian performs a seemingly idle dance. Hapu sends out her {{p|Golurk}} and orders it to use {{m|Flash Cannon}}; the attack almost strikes Tapu Fini when it seems to dissipate. Hapu\'s grandfather then appears and informs her that Tapu Fini has accepted her as the new [[Poni Island]] [[Island Kahuna|Kahuna]] because of her heartfelt gesture to save her friends. Tapu Fini then lets out a shrill cry, causing the mist to clear. With that, Stoutland and Mallow\'s mother disappear, but not before they give their last goodbyes. Mallow then encounters a {{pkmn2|wild}} {{p|Shaymin}} in some nearby grass.\n\nAt Hapu\'s radish garden patch, Mallow returns to her classmates with Shaymin, and {{Rotom}} informs her that it is a [[Mythical Pokémon]]. Upon hearing Rotom\'s [[Pokédex]] entry data, Mallow asks Shaymin to stay with her until the upcoming Gracidea season, and Shaymin agrees. Mallow informs everyone that she saw her mother, while Ash says that he saw Stoutland. Lillie and Gladion, however, are disappointed to not have seen their father. Hapu arrives and says this must mean he is still alive somewhere. The siblings are shocked by this revelation and realize that they should inform {{an|Lusamine}} immediately. Before Gladion leaves, however, Hapu reveals Tapu Fini recognizes her as the new Island Kahuna. Ash eagerly asks for a [[Island challenge|grand trial]] against Hapu, but she tells him that she must first attend a ritual to formally receive the title. However, she is more than happy to battle Ash once the ritual is over.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
