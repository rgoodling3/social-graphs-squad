It was first broadcast in Japan on May 21, 1998, and in the United States on February 20, 1999.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/01_42-the-song-of-jigglypuff/-->\n<i>Our heroes trudge along, resigning themselves to the idea of camping out in the desert as the sun slowly sets. Suddenly they see bright lights in front of them: a glamorous city appears before them, covered in neon lights. They have found Neon Town, a city that is loud and boisterous 24 hours a day, famous for having no nights. The residents of Neon City sleep as little as possible and use all of their time to play. Behind the other side of the town\'s glorious facade, however, people are always angry and irritated. Fights being an everyday occurrence, Jenny, the policewoman, is terribly busy. Having had enough of a town so noisy one can\'t even sleep at night, our heroes head out into the peaceful forest. There they chance across Jigglypuff, the singing Pokémon.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nWalking through a desert, {{Ash}}, {{an|Misty}}, and {{an|Brock}} arrive in [[Neon Town]]. In the city, a man bumps into Ash and is infuriated. Ash insults him, and when Brock tells him to apologize, he refuses. Before the situation could escalate, [[Officer Jenny]] steps in, sending the man on his way, and tells Ash and his friends to find a hotel to sleep in. Misty notices that this Jenny is a bit edgy. Later, {{TRT}} shows up in town and [[James]] bumps into the same man, who punches him repeatedly over the head. Meanwhile, [[Jessie]] is spanked by a large woman for bumping into her.\n\nThe next morning, as Ash, Misty, and Brock come out of a hotel, they notice several people arguing with one another. Deciding to leave right away, they head to a forest outside the city and spot a {{p|Jigglypuff}}. Misty expresses her desire to {{pkmn2|caught|catch}} one and calls out {{TP|Misty|Staryu}}, but {{TP|Misty|Psyduck}} pops out instead. Misty scolds it and puts it back into the {{i|Poké Ball}}, much to her dismay. After that, she sends out Staryu and it uses {{m|Double-Edge}} on Jigglypuff. The little pink round {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} gets upset and cries. The gang then finds out that {{an|Jigglypuff|this Jigglypuff}} has a problem with {{m|sing}}ing. Misty apologizes for attacking it earlier and hugs the Pokémon; she then decides that they should teach it to sing.\n\nHiding and spying on the gang, Team Rocket decides they want to use the Jigglypuff to put the people of Neon Town to sleep, in order to steal their Pokémon. They reveal themselves to the gang while wearing costumes and proceed to sing a tune radically different from their {{motto}}. After they finish, Team Rocket reveals their latest scheme. Ash sends out his {{AP|Bulbasaur}} to {{pkmn|battle}}; James sends out his {{TP|James|Weezing}}. Bulbasaur\'s {{m|Vine Whip}} puts Weezing into a spin, resulting in Weezing\'s {{m|Poison Gas}} hitting Team Rocket instead. Misty calls her Staryu and orders it to blast Team Rocket away using {{m|Water Gun}}.\n\nAfterwards, Misty gives Jigglypuff some lessons on breath control when singing. {{AP|Pikachu}} sings as well, and when Ash compliments him, Jigglypuff gets annoyed and secretly kicks Pikachu. Before anyone can notice it, it hides behind Misty, who then inflates a balloon and puts it in Jigglypuff\'s mouth. The air inflates Jigglypuff and it goes flying. Brock also helps it by giving it a fruit that can help make its throat feel better. Jigglypuff takes a bite and instantly starts singing. Pikachu starts celebrating, but Jigglypuff kicks him again, and before the Pokémon can notice, Jigglypuff is already in Misty\'s arms.\n\nMisty requests Jigglypuff to sing; it obliges and starts singing beautifully. Meanwhile, Team Rocket, hiding amongst some grass, sets up a tape reel recorder and a connected boom microphone to capture Jigglypuff\'s voice. As Jigglypuff sings, everyone falls asleep. When Jigglypuff notices everyone sleeping, it inflates itself in anger, goes through Ash\'s [[Bag|backpack]], pulls out a black marker, and scribbles markings all over their faces. It also finds Team Rocket sleeping and tries waking them up with {{m|Double Slap}}. Unable to wake them up, Jigglypuff scribbles on their faces as well.\n\nAsh, Misty, and Brock wake up, only to find their faces covered with markings. They rub it off and see that Jigglypuff is mad at them. Misty realizes that they must have fallen asleep during the performance and apologizes to Jigglypuff. Everyone tries to cheer it up by letting their Pokémon listen to its singing. However, all of their Pokémon also fall asleep. Then, Misty decides to let Psyduck listen to Jigglypuff\'s singing, since Psyduck is apparently so dumb it wouldn\'t know if it was awake or asleep. After Jigglypuff sings for Psyduck, it still becomes angry, and Misty realizes that Psyduck fell asleep with its eyes still open. Meanwhile, Team Rocket finally wakes up and see their faces are covered with markings. They rub it off and proceed to check the recording. Unfortunately, the recorder did not capture Jigglypuff\'s singing and recorded their loud snoring instead.\n\nBrock suggests they take Jigglypuff to perform for the sleepless people of Neon Town, which Team Rocket is happy to hear. When they get into town, the gang looks for a place for Jigglypuff to sing, to no avail. A stage truck then pulls over, driven by Jessie and James, [[List of Team Rocket\'s disguises|disguised]] as rock stars, who offers them their stage. Once the stage is set, Jigglypuff starts singing into a microphone and begins to pull a crowd. However, its voice echoes throughout Neon Town\'s restaurants and gambling dens, causing everyone in the town to fall asleep. Team Rocket, whose ears were not plugged in properly, fall asleep as well. Once Jigglypuff is finished, it gets upset with its dormant audience and goes on to scribble markings on everyone\'s faces. The next morning, Ash and his friends wake up, only to realize what happened. Jigglypuff is nowhere to be seen, and they assume it must have left out of anger. When the townspeople wake up, they seem friendlier to one another; the man who bumped into Ash earlier even apologizes to him. Misty call outs for Jigglypuff, though there is no response. Team Rocket awakens and leaves the city looking very happy despite their latest failure.\n\nAs Ash, Misty, and Brock leave the city, unbeknownst to them, Jigglypuff follows close behind.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
