It first aired in Japan on August 28, 2003 and in the United States on September 4, 2004. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/06_52-whats-with-wattson/-->\n<i>Ash and company are finally at the Mauville Gym. They have an electrifying introduction to Wattson, the Gym\'s leader, who specializes in Electric-type Pokémon. They discover that he seems to enjoy being a bit of a trickster. Upon entering the gym, they are sent through a type of electric slide/roller coaster ending in a mechanical Raikou, which Pikachu tries to attack.\n\nElsewhere, Team Rocket is exploring the possibility of capturing a large array of Electric-type Pokémon they just found.\n\nWattson decides on a three-on-three match. He uses his Magnemite, but Pikachu knocks it out in one hit. Next he sends in Voltorb, which Pikachu also KO\'s in one hit. Finally, Wattson sends in Magneton, which also falls to Pikachu. Everyone is shocked and amazed, but Wattson recovers and hands Ash the Dynamo Badge. \n\nAsh rushes his Pikachu to the Pokémon Center to recover. There he finds out that it is overloaded with electricity; probably from the Raikou incident. Wattson decides to go to the mountainside to mull over his loss for a bit when he encounters Team Rocket stealing the Electric-type Pokémon. Ash and company arrive and they all help Wattson recover the Pokémon from Team Rocket before sending them blasting off again.\n\nAsh tries to give the Dynamo Badge back to Wattson because Pikachu won due to its being overcharged. Wattson tells him to keep it, though, because Ash deserves it.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} eagerly wait outside the doors to the [[Mauville Gym]] so Ash can battle for his {{Badge|Dynamo}}. Ash pushes on the door, only for it to surprisingly fall to the ground. As everyone steps on, the door transforms into a moving platform which whisks them through a rollercoaster-like track and across some water before coming face to face with a {{p|Raikou}}. Thinking it will attack, Ash immediately takes action and has {{AP|Pikachu}} strike it with {{m|Iron Tail}}. The head of the Raikou explodes, revealing that it was just a robot. [[Wattson]], the [[Mauville City]] [[Gym Leader]], along with his assistant {{an|Watt}} promptly appear out of a side door to greet the group. Wattson appears delighted with Ash for being able to defeat the mechanical Raikou and happily accepts his Gym challenge. Meanwhile, {{TRT}} discovers what appears to be an abandoned power station, [[New Mauville]]. Thinking that they could use this as a base for their operations in the [[Hoenn]] [[region]], they proceed to enter only to find out that it\'s filled with {{p|Voltorb}} and {{p|Magnemite}}. Dejected, [[Jessie]] and [[James]] leave only to be stopped by a scheming {{MTR}} who informs them that the {{t|Electric}} Pokémon would make a great present for the {{an|Giovanni|Boss}}. \n\nLater, Watt announces that the Gym match between Ash versus Wattson can begin. Wattson declares that the match will be a three-on-three and he will be using his Voltorb, Magnemite, and {{p|Magneton}} and as he\'s been training with them all for years Ash should expect a tough battle. {{an|Brock}} and the others are shocked that Wattson disclosed which Pokémon he\'ll be using, before turning their attention to Ash’s potential choices. Pikachu, more eager than ever, leaps onto the battlefield determined to go first and Ash agrees. Wattson laughs, happy that Ash is using an Electric-type against his and commands Magnemite to use {{m|Swift}}. Ash responds by having Pikachu use {{m|Thunderbolt}}, which proves so powerful that it knocks out Magnemite with a single hit. Wattson is stunned, but still jovial and sends in Voltorb telling it to use {{m|Screech}}. Ash has Pikachu use another Thunderbolt and Voltorb is also taken out in a single hit. By now, everyone is surprised at Pikachu\'s amazing performance, while Wattson has lost most of his jolly nature and, now determined to defeat Ash, angrily sends in Magneton ordering a {{m|Zap Cannon}}. Ash now has Pikachu use {{m|Thunder}}, which easily plows through the Zap Cannon and knocks Magneton out instantly. Ash is declared the winner, and no one can believe his swift victory. Wattson is completely shell-shocked at being defeated so easily, however he attempts to put a brave face on and awards Ash the Dynamo Badge before leaving the Gym, much to Watt’s concerns. However Ash doesn\'t get a chance to celebrate his win as he notices that Pikachu\'s not feeling well.\n\nAt the [[Pokémon Center]], Wattson is sadly handing his Pokémon over to [[Nurse Joy]] so they can recover from the battle and informs her that Watt will be sent to pick them up later. Nurse Joy appears confused at seeing the usual bubbly and warm Wattson seeming so somber and dejected, but Wattson just tells her he\'s having a bad day before leaving. Soon after he\'s gone Ash, Watt and the others rush into the Pokémon Center asking Nurse Joy to check out a now clearly sick Pikachu. Meanwhile, Wattson has ventured over to the abandoned power plant to mull over is the disastrous battle with Ash. He soon concludes that he is no longer worthy of the title of Gym Leader. A wild {{p|Electrike}} approaches Wattson, and the pair begin playing. Back at the Pokémon Center, Nurse Joy tells the group that Pikachu\'s electric levels were higher than usual and asks Ash if he\'s been exposed to any high voltage recently which makes Ash disclose the incident with the mechanical Raikou. Nurse Joy informs the group that Pikachu is overcharged which enables him to have a lot of power in his electric attacks for a short period of time. Brock realizes that this is reason for Ash\'s shocking victory over Wattson. The medical treatment is soon over, with Pikachu leaping into Ash\'s arms. Wattson\'s assistant storms into the treatment room asking if Nurse Joy has seen Wattson as he seems to have disappeared. She recalls the incident a few moments ago where he dropped off his Pokémon somberly, then works out that Wattson is at his favorite location, the abandoned power plant.\n\nBack at New Mauville, Electrike shows Wattson its {{m|Thunder Wave}}, making him laugh. Wattson then turns to see Team Rocket stealing the Voltorb and Magnemite from the power plant in a [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|new electric proof machine]]. As Ash and the others arrive on the scene, Team Rocket promptly vacuum up Pikachu and Electrike. Ash prepares to call on another Pokemon for assistance, but Meowth fires a capture net and snares everyone. Team Rocket rumble off, overjoyed with their apparent victory over the [[twerp]]s. However, a giant mechanical Raikou followed by Ash and the others blocks their path. As Team Rocket consider their options against the Raikou, Brock and {{an|May}} calls out {{TP|Brock|Forretress}} and {{TP|May|Torchic}} respectively. Though the {{m|Rapid Spin}} and {{m|Ember}} combination proves unsuccessful. Luckily the robo-Raikou\'s intimidating glare and occasional roars keep the Rocket trio petrified while Pikachu leads all of the caged Pokemon in a joint attempt to escape. Team Rocket eventually decides to attack the Raikou and have {{TP|Jessie|Seviper}} launch a {{m|Poison Tail}} on it which immediately destroys it. Right at that moment the caged escape. Seviper and {{TP|James|Cacnea}} attack Pikachu, however Pikachu easily batters them away with a {{m|Quick Attack}}. {{TP|Jessie|Dustox}} is then sent out and blows Pikachu away. As Dustox prepares to use {{m|Psybeam}}, it is startled by Electrike\'s Thunder Wave. Pikachu regains his footing and sends Team Rocket blasting off with a Thundebolt.\n\nAfterwards, Ash confesses to Wattson that Pikachu was overcharged at the time of their Gym battle, hence the quick victory. He tries to hand the Dynamo Badge back to Wattson, but Wattson says that he deserves it for his efforts in helping save the Pokémon at the power plant. Ash is still uncertain, but Watt says that Wattson never lies. With that, Ash happily declares that he has rightfully earned the Badge. Wattson affirms that he will resume his role as Mauville Gym Leader, now with a new Electrike to train. He turns to Ash and requests a future [[rematch]] once his Electrike has grown a bit, and Ash agrees to the idea.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:Ash Dynamo Badge.png|thumb|220px|Ash holding the Dynamo Badge]]\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrive at the [[Mauville Gym]] and meet [[Wattson]], the [[Mauville City]] [[Gym Leader]].\n* Ash defeats Wattson easily, due to his {{AP|Pikachu}} being overcharged from an earlier incident, and earns the {{badge|Dynamo}}.\n* [[Jessie\'s Dustox]] is revealed to know {{m|Whirlwind}}.\n* Wattson {{pkmn2|caught|catches}} an {{TP|Wattson|Electrike}}.\n* Ash tries to return his Dynamo Badge, but Wattson tells him to keep it.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* [[Wattson]]\n* {{an|Watt}}\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n=====TV episode debuts=====\n* {{p|Electrike}} ({{OP|Wattson|Electrike}})\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{an|Giovanni}} ([[Boss fantasy|fantasy]])\n* [[Wattson]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* {{an|Watt}}\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP AG040.png|200px|thumb|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Meditite}}\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Torchic}} ({{OP|May|Torchic}})\n* {{p|Forretress}} ({{OP|Brock|Forretress}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Dustox}} ({{OP|Jessie|Dustox}})\n* {{p|Cacnea}} ({{OP|James|Cacnea}})\n* {{p|Magnemite}} ([[Wattson]]\'s)\n* {{p|Magneton}} ([[Wattson]]\'s)\n* {{p|Voltorb}} ([[Wattson]]\'s)\n* {{p|Electrike}} ({{OP|Wattson|Manectric}}; new)\n* {{p|Magnemite}} (×3)\n* {{p|Magneton}} (×3)\n* {{p|Voltorb}} (multiple)\n\n==Trivia==\n* This is the last main series episode that was skipped in the {{pmin|Finland|Finnish}} [[dub]], with all of the future main series episodes airing in Finnish sooner or later after their English dub release (on the condition that they are dubbed in English).\n* This is the last time to date when {{Ash}} has won a [[Gym]] [[Badge]] in the same episode in which he meets the [[Gym Leader]].\n* This is the season finale of [[S06|Pokémon: Advanced]].\n* This is the final episode of the {{series|Advanced Generation}} to air in {{pmin|Poland}}.\n* This episode is the last to feature the [[Who\'s That Pokémon?]] eyecatch in the dub until \'\'[[BW001|In the Shadow of Zekrom!]]\'\', almost six years and eight seasons later.\n* On [[Pokémon.com]] and [[iTunes]], this episode is listed as \'\'\'What\'s With Wattson?\'\'\'.\n* This is the first time Ash has won a Gym {{pkmn|battle}} without any of his Pokémon being defeated, excluding one-on-one battles.\n** This is also the only Gym battle that Ash won using only one Pokémon, once again excluding one-on-one battles.\n\n===Errors===\n* Before the battle, [[Max]] states that the {{t|Grass}} type is strong against the {{t|Electric}} type.\n** However, he may have been referring to the fact that the Grass type has a resistance to Electric-type attacks.\n* When Ash gets {{AP|Pikachu}} back from the cage, the inner green circle on his hat is smaller than usual.\n* [[Max]] says that {{m|Thunder Wave}} {{status|Confusion|confused}} [[Jessie\'s Dustox]], but actually it {{status|Paralysis|paralyzed}} it.\n* When all of the Pokémon freed from Team Rocket gather around Wattson, Voltorb are shown to be almost the same size as Magneton. They should be half the size of Magneton, according to their [[Pokédex]] entries.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* In the Japanese version, the {{p|Raikou}} that Pikachu destroyed and the Raikou that defeated {{TRT}} were two different robots. However, the dub neglects to mention this, and instead implies that Wattson repaired the Raikou that Pikachu destroyed between his destroying it and it blasting off Team Rocket.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=9999FF|bordercolor=FF7777\n|zh_cmn={{tt|紫菫道館，鐵旋的電擊戰鬥！|Zǐjǐn (Mauville) Gym, Wattson\'s Electric Shock Battle!}}\n|da={{tt|Pikachu i stødet|Pikachu in top form}} {{tt|*|The title includes a pun, as "stød" literally means "shock"}}\n|nl={{tt|Wat is er met Wattson?|Watt\'s with Wattson?}}\n|de={{tt|Spaß muss sein|It has to be fun}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Un match électrique|An electric match}}\n|he=קרב מחשמל{{tt|krav mekhashmel|An electrifying battle}}\n|hi=Wattson को क्या हुआ है? {{tt|\'\'Wattson ko kya hua hai?\'\'|What has happened to Wattson?}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n|it={{tt|Incontro scioccante|Shocking match}}\n|ko={{tt|전기포켓몬 대 전기포켓몬 승리는 누구에게?|Electric Pokémon VS Electric Pokémon Who will Win?}}\n|no={{tt|Hva er det med Wattson?|What is it with Wattson?}}\n|pl={{tt|Watt i Wattson|Watt and Wattson}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Com Carga Total|With Full Charge}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Qual é a do Wattson?|What\'s with Wattson?}}\n|ru={{tt|Мегаватты Ватсона|Watson\'s megawatt}} {{tt|*|written title}}<br/>{{tt|Ватт и Ватсон|Watt and Wattson}} {{tt|*|spoken title}}\n|es_la={{tt|¿Wattson y Watt?|Wattson and Watt?}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Watt y Wattson|Watt and Wattson}}\n|sv={{tt|Wattson och Watt!|Watson and Watt!}}\n}}\n<br>\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=AG039 |\nprevtitle=A Poké-BLOCK Party! |\nnextcode=AG041 |\nnexttitle=What You Seed is What You Get |\nseries=Advanced Generation series |\ncolorscheme=Hoenn }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0314}}\n[[Category:Advanced Generation series episodes|040]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Aya Matsui]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Yoshitaka Fujimoto]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Masahiko Watanabe]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Masaaki Iwane]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which Ash gets a Badge]]\n[[Category:Episodes with Gym battles]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Ash]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Pikachu]]\n\n[[de:Spaß muss sein]]\n[[es:EP316]]\n[[fr:AG040]]\n[[it:AG040]]\n[[ja:AG編第40話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 超世代 第40集]]'}
