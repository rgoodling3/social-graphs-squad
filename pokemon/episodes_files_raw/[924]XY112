A Maidens\' Fierce Fight Where Sparks Fly!!\'\') is the 112th episode of the {{series|XY}}, and the 911th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on March 17, 2016 and in the United States on June 25, 2016.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/19_19-master-class-is-in-session/-->\n<i>It’s time for the Pokémon Showcase Master Class, and Serena’s friends and rivals have come to compete: Shauna, Miette, and Nini! For the first time, the performers are competing simultaneously in a Freestyle Performance, and the top vote-getter from each group of three moves on.\n\nJessie (disguised as Jessilee) wins Nini’s group in the first round, and Serena beats Miette! Afterward, both girls are upset, but they congratulate Serena and demand that she win it all for them. Serena, Jessie, and Shauna move on to compete in the semi-finals—and the winner will challenge Aria for the title of Kalos Queen!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} have arrived in [[Gloire City]], where the [[Pokémon Showcase]] Master Class is set to take place. {{an|Serena}} is thinking about the competition ahead of her while looking at the gigantic castle where the {{DL|Pokémon Performer|Kalos Queen}} will be crowned. She is soon joined by her [[rival]]s {{an|Shauna}}, [[Miette]], and [[Nini]], who have each collected three {{DL|Pokémon Showcase|Princess Key}}s and are ready to perform as well. Nearby, [[Jessie]] is already disguised as Jessilee and claiming that she will be the one to win the Master Class.\n\nAt the [[Pokémon Center]], Serena is seen talking to her [[mother]], {{kal|Grace}}, who informs her that she will be in the audience to watch her daughter perform. Serena tells Grace that she is worried she will not be able to perform well, and Grace says that being nervous is natural and that she always got nervous before a race. Serena remembers that she initially set off on her {{pkmn|journey}} only because she did not want to be a {{p|Rhyhorn}} racer, but since then she has met many wonderful friends and Pokémon who have supported her all the way through, and this inspires her to give it her all and go for broke when the Master Class begins.\n\nThe next day, Serena and her rivals are seen in the dressing room of Gloire City\'s castle making their final preparations as [[Monsieur Pierre]] takes the stage to welcome the audience and announce the start of the Master Class. He asks everyone to turn their attention to a part of the stage where several booths appear. Inside each booth is a {{pkmn|Performer}}, who has to use three Princess Keys to open the door and access the stage. As Serena unlocks the door, she reminds of several moments of her journey and affirms that she will become the next Kalos Queen. All 27 Performers are lined up on stage as people across the [[Kalos]] [[region]] watch the competition on [[television]]. Pierre then introduces [[Palermo]] saying that she has agreed to take on the role of special judge. Palermo says she is looking forward to see many wonderful performances and wishes good luck to the contestants.\n\nAfter that, Pierre introduces the current Kalos Queen {{an|Aria}} as she enters the stage together with her {{TP|Aria|Delphox}}. She walks down a long staircase and heads to the center of the stage, where she greets her fans and the Performers competing for her title. Following Aria\'s speech, Monsieur Pierre starts explaining the rules, informing that the Master Class consists of Freestyle Performances only. Ash is surprised by the lack of Theme Performances and {{an|Clemont}} concludes that these rounds are intended to show off the [[Friendship|strong bond]] between Performers and their Pokémon, and since Performers have come this far, it must be assumed that they are beyond these early stages. Pierre continues explaining the tournament format, saying that Performers must perform with a single Pokémon in the first and second rounds, while the semifinals will feature Performers using two of their Pokémon. The winner of the semifinals will challenge Aria and, if successful, receive the prestigious title of Kalos Queen as well as a tiara.\n[[File:XY112 Concetta VS Nini VS Jessilee.png|thumb|left|250px|Concetta, Nini, and Jessilee]]\n[[File:XY112 Sara Lee VS Serena VS Miette.png|thumb|250px|Sara Lee, Serena, and Miette]]\nBackstage, Serena has decided to use {{TP|Serena|Braixen}} in the first round as she knows she will be up against Miette. On stage, Pierre introduces the first group of competitors, consisting of Jessilee and her {{TP|Jessie|Gourgeist}}, Nini and her {{p|Smoochum}}, and [[Concetta]] and her {{p|Scraggy}}. He explains that the round starts with a solo performance from each pair and then all three pairs perform at once. Jessilee uses these rules to her advantage, covering her opponents in smoke during the simultaneous performance and drawing all the attention to herself and Gourgeist, a strategy which proves to be very effective as she becomes the most voted Performer of her group and advances to the second round. As a result of Jessilee\'s victory, Nini and Concetta are eliminated from the tournament and Nini cries over her loss.\n\nTimes passes and Pierre introduces the fourth group: [[Sara Lee]] and {{p|Glaceon}}, Serena and Braixen, and Miette and {{p|Slurpuff}}. They all deliver good performances, but Serena comes out on top, earning the most votes and moving on to the second round. Backstage, Miette wipes her tears and goes on to congratulate Serena for her victory. She asks Serena to win the whole competition, and Nini appears and says the same. Serena says she will win and all three girls look at a monitor where Pierre is shown announcing that Shauna will be moving on to the second round. In the second round, Serena, Shauna, and Jessilee defeat their opponents using {{TP|Serena|Pancham}}, {{TP|Shauna|Ivysaur}}, and {{MTR}}, respectively. The three of them must now face one another in the semifinals.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
