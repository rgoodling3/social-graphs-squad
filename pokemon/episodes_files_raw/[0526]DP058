Coronet, Ash and Turtwig are battling Alan, an energetic Trainer with a Nosepass. The only place Nosepass can evolve into Probopass is Mt. Coronet, so Alan is eager to have all the battles he can. Sure enough, Nosepass evolves during the heated battle, but Alan's delight is short-lived: a strange device lands on Probopass's head and causes it to act strangely, even turning against Alan! It's all the work of Team Rocket and their new Probopass Power Mind Manipulator antenna, which they use to control Probopass so they can steal it and run away.\n\nAlan is heartbroken, but Ash and his friends promise to help him rescue Probopass. They track Team Rocket to the bank of the river, and Ash sends Buizel to cross the river and steal the antenna remote control. When Buizel is spotted, a fight breaks out that damages the remote control! As Probopass runs away, so Alan leaps on its back and tries to bring it back to its senses. He even has Pikachu shock them with Thunderbolt, but nothing works.\n\nFinally, Alan asks our heroes to knock him and Probopass into a lake, where he finally manages to pry the antenna off and restore Probopass to normal. But back on shore, Team Rocket has snared Ash and his friends in a net. When Alan, Probopass, and Buizel surface, Buizel cuts everyone free with Sonic Boom and Probopass helps our heroes defeat Team Rocket. With that done, Alan and Ash resume their battle!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Incomplete plot}}\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} meet a boy named [[Alan]] who has a {{p|Nosepass}}. Ash asks for a {{pkmn|battle}} with him and he agrees. However, Alan explains that he wants to battle near [[Mt. Coronet]] so his Nosepass can [[Evolution|evolve]] due to the [[special magnetic field]] present in the area.\n\nThen, they start another battle and Nosepass evolves into {{p|Probopass}}, which {{an|Dawn}} looks up on her [[Pokédex]]. Ash and Alan continue the battle, but a kind of helmet falls on Probopass's head. Probopass starts doing bad things because {{TRT}} controls it, even attacking its own Trainer.\n\n{{TRT}} appears and tells Alan, Ash, and his friends that they are controlling Probopass. They go away and take the Compass Pokémon with them.\n\nAsh, Dawn, {{an|Brock}}, and Alan go searching for Team Rocket. Ash, Dawn, Brock and Alan find Team Rocket. Alan tries to go stop them, but Ash stops him and states that if he tries to rescue Probopass he will get attacked. Ash sends out his {{AP|Buizel}}, which attacks {{MTR}} and [[Jessie]] with water. He goes to retrieve the remote, but accidentally drops it, causing Team Rocket to notice Buizel. In response, {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} and Buizel battle for the remote, which is then knocked into the air by {{AP|Staravia}}. Ash jumps to catch it, but [[Jessie's Dustox]] uses {{m|Whirlwind}}, causing Ash to fall into the water.\n\nThe remote then hits Probopass's antennae. After it gets destroyed, Probopass continues to act out. It first attacks Team Rocket, then Ash and his friends. Alan hops on Probopass to get rid of its helmet. Alan then asks Pikachu to use {{m|Thunderbolt}}. This causes Alan and Probopass to be shocked. Alan then has Buizel use {{m|Water Gun}}, Pikachu use Thunderbolt and {{TP|Dawn|Pachirisu}} to use {{m|Discharge}}. This knocks them into the lake.\n\nAlan removes the helmet and attacks Team Rocket, causing Team Rocket to blast off.\n\nAfterwards, Ash and Alan continue their battle.\n\n==Major events==\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Probopass}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Alan]]\n* {{pkmn|Trainer}}s (flashback)\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Mime Jr.}} ({{OP|James|Mime Jr.}})\n* {{p|Staravia}} ({{OP|Ash|Staravia}})\n* {{p|Turtwig}} ({{OP|Ash|Turtwig}})\n* {{p|Buizel}} ({{OP|Ash|Buizel}})\n* {{p|Pachirisu}} ({{OP|Dawn|Pachirisu}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Dustox}} ({{OP|Jessie|Dustox}})\n* {{p|Carnivine}} ({{OP|James|Carnivine}})\n* {{p|Nosepass}} ([[Alan]]'s; evolves)\n* {{p|Probopass}} ([[Alan]]'s; newly evolved; debut)\n* {{p|Ursaring}} (Trainer's; flashback)\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[Professor Oak's Big Pokémon Encyclopedia]]: {{p|Shieldon}}\n** Pokémon senryū: うけとめろ\u3000かおでぼうぎょだ\u3000タテトプス ''Uketomeru, kao de bōgyo da, Tatetopusu.''\n* [[Pokémon Symphonic Medley]] was used as background music.\n* The dub's title is a reference to the song {{wp|She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain}}.\n* This is the first episode of the {{pkmn|anime}} to mention location-based evolution that was introduced in the [[Generation IV]] games.\n* This is one of the few episodes of the {{series|Diamond & Pearl}} where [[Dawn's Piplup]] does not appear.\n\n===Errors===\n* In the opening scene where {{AP|Turtwig}} battles {{p|Nosepass}}, Turtwig's [[Shin'ichirō Miki|Japanese voice]] can be heard over its [[Carter Cathcart|English voice]].\n* This episode takes place while {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} are traveling from [[Hearthome City]] to [[Solaceon Town]]; however, [[Mt.
