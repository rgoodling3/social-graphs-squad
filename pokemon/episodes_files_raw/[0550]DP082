It first aired in Japan on June 5, 2008 and in the United States on November 15, 2008.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/11_28-cream-of-the-croagunk-crop/-->\n<i>Ash has reached the Pastoria City Gym, but there\'s no Gym battling today—the Gym Leader, Crasher Wake, is off to the Pastoria Great Marsh. He invites Ash and the gang to join him, and our heroes are spooked to see lots of Croagunk emerging from the marsh grass. Every household in Pastoria City has a Croagunk and today is the annual Croagunk Festival! Last year\'s festival honors went to Craig, a Croagunk owned by Hamilton. Hamilton wants Craig to marry Chrissy, Nurse Joy\'s Croagunk, but Chrissy isn\'t interested. Hearing this, Brock enters the Croagunk Festival, hoping his Croagunk will win the crown and save Chrissy from an unwanted union.\n\nOut in the marsh, James reminisces about meeting his Carnivine while Jessie and Meowth plan to enter the Croagunk Festival with Meowth in a Croagunk costume! Meowth even excels in the first round of the Festival, a Croagunk beauty contest that leaves Dawn at a loss to tell all those Croagunk apart. The next round is a brick-breaking competition; Brock\'s Croagunk aces the round, but Meowth ends up with nothing more than an aching paw to show for it. So now it\'s Brock\'s Croagunk and Hamilton\'s Craig in the final championship battle!\n\nThe title bout is interrupted by Team Rocket\'s giant Croagunk Robot, which steals the Crown and both battling Croagunk. Crasher Wake left his Poké Balls at the Gym, so he calls on all the other Croagunk to stop Team Rocket. Nurse Joy and Chrissy lead the charge with Chrissy\'s Vacuum Wave attack, and with a little help from Ash and Pikachu, Team Rocket is put down for the count. Chrissy\'s show of bravery earns her the Croagunk Festival crown, and everyone celebrates by singing and dancing into the night. But come the next morning, Ash will have to face Crasher Wake at the Pastoria Gym!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrive at [[Pastoria City]] and run into [[Crasher Wake]]. He introduces himself and Ash immediately challenges him to a [[Gym]] {{pkmn|battle}}. Crasher Wake says he has some business to attend to and asks Ash and his friends if they would like to accompany him; they agree.\n\nThey hurry to catch the tram that takes them through the [[Great Marsh]]. When they arrive, Crasher Wake rushes ahead and they arrive at an open field at sunset. They\'re startled by glowing eyes in the bushes, which turn out to be a bunch of wild {{p|Croagunk}}. Then, they follow a bunch of Croagunk Trainers to a giant {{p|Croagunk}} Temple. They meet up with Crasher Wake again, who informs them of the [[Pastoria Croagunk Festival]] and the ancient tradition of battling {{p|Croagunk}}, with the leader becoming Champion of the Great Marsh.\n\n{{an|Brock}} intrudes in an argument between [[Nurse Joy]] and [[Hamilton]], a brown-haired (turquoise-haired in the first airing of the episode in Japan) male whose Croagunk, Craig, won last year\'s Croagunk Championship. Brock goes crazy for Nurse Joy, proposing a marriage of their Croagunk, only to be Poison Jabbed by his own Croagunk and dragged off-screen.\n\nMeanwhile, {{TRT}} arrives at the Great Marsh. [[James]] recalls his childhood, during which he first met and rescued his {{TP|James|Carnivine}}, who was trapped in the Great Marsh mud.\n\nAsh and his friends enjoy the evening festival, eating Croagunk cookies and watching Croagunk-shaped fireworks. Crasher Wake referees the event and introduces Hamilton, the defending Champion. Crasher Wake, the operator of the rail system, and Nurse Joy judge the competition. All of the Croagunk take turns coming on stage, crouching then croaking, apparently comparing their looks and physical condition. The judges and local crowd are excited by their different aspects, but Ash and company are confused; as far as they can see, the Croagunk all look exactly the same. Brock\'s Croagunk takes the stage and the judges are impressed by Croagunk\'s looks.\n\nTeam Rocket dresses {{MTR}} up in a Croagunk costume and sends him out on stage. Meowth is thoroughly embarrassed, but the crowd and judges go wild for it. Hamilton is unimpressed.\n\nCrasher Wake announces the brick-breaking contest. Brock\'s Croagunk uses {{m|Brick Break}} and breaks all of the bricks. Meowth takes the stage next, to high anticipation. He charges up and attacks the bricks, but since he can\'t learn Brick Break, the only thing he breaks is his paw. Crasher Wake announces a championship battle between Brock\'s Croagunk and Craig. They take to the boxing ring and begin the match. Craig uses {{m|Cross Chop}}. The dueling Croagunk trade jabs and {{an|Dawn}} has trouble figuring which one is which.\n\nOut of nowhere, Team Rocket storms the festival in a giant Croagunk robot. Its tongue steals the prized crown. Craig and Brock\'s Croagunk attack the robot, but are trapped by the tongue. Crasher Wake steps in to help, but suddenly remembers that he left all his Poké Balls at the Gym. Everyone else\'s Croagunk attack the giant robot, but they\'re scooped into its belly. Chrissy heavily damages the robot, followed by Pikachu\'s {{m|Thunderbolt}}.\n\nCrasher Wake retrieves the crown and asks the crowd if they agree that Nurse Joy\'s Croagunk won this year\'s championship, which they do. Afterwards, Crasher Wake tells Ash that he was impressed by Pikachu\'s {{m|Thunderbolt}} and accepts his challenge for a Gym Battle, but it\'ll have to be held the next day as there\'s still plenty of partying to do. And so, with Ash\'s fourth Sinnoh Gym Battle on the horizon, everyone finishes out the traditional Croagunk Festival evening with dancing.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrive in [[Pastoria City]] and meet the local [[Gym Leader]], [[Crasher Wake]].\n* [[James]] is revealed to have {{pkmn2|caught}} his {{TP|James|Carnivine}} at the [[Great Marsh]].\n* {{an|Brock}} enters the [[Pastoria Croagunk Festival]] competition and loses.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* [[Crasher Wake]]\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Crasher Wake]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* [[Hamilton]]\n* [[Carny]]\n* {{pkmn|Trainer}}s\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Piplup}} ({{OP|Dawn|Piplup}})\n* {{p|Croagunk}} ({{OP|Brock|Croagunk}})\n* {{p|Carnivine}} ({{OP|James|Carnivine}})\n* {{p|Croagunk}} ([[Nurse Joy]]\'s; Chrissy)\n* {{p|Croagunk}} ([[Hamilton]]\'s; Craig)\n* {{p|Croagunk}} (Trainers\'; multiple)\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:Craig crown.png|thumb|200px|right||The crown]]\n[[File:Blue Haired Hamilton.png|thumb|200px|right|Hamilton\'s original appearance]]\n[[File:Hamilton.png|thumb|200px|right|Hamilton\'s changed appearance]]\n* Instead of [[Professor Oak\'s Big Pokémon Encyclopedia]], the end of the episode featured a memorial to \'\'[[M08|Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]\'\' called [[Pikachu the Movie Memorial]]. This is part of a countdown to \'\'[[M11|Giratina and the Sky Warrior]]\'\'.\n* [[Jessie\'s Wobbuffet]] doesn\'t appear in this episode.\n* Details of this episode were made known in [[K-Zone]], a children\'s magazine, before any official Japanese episode listing.\n* This episode shows how James and Carnivine met and possibly explains why Carnivine is so affectionate.\n* [[Pokémon Ondo]] and music from \'\'[[EP039|Pikachu\'s Goodbye]]\'\' are used as background music.\n* The diamond and pearl on the crown are references to {{game|Diamond and Pearl|s}}.\n* The segment where Brock fantasizes about marrying Nurse Joy and his Croagunk marrying hers echoes that of a similar fantasy he had in \'\'[[EP165|Hassle in the Castle]]\'\' where he dreamed of marrying [[Dr. Anna|a woman]] while his {{TP|Brock|Zubat|Crobat}} married her female Pokémon of the same species. Coincidentally, both Croagunk and Zubat (now Crobat) are Brock\'s only {{t|Poison}} types.\n* During the {{m|Brick Break}} contest, only [[Brock\'s Croagunk]]\'s hands glow white.\n* The dub title refers to the phrase "\'\'the cream of the crop\'\'".\n* Hamilton\'s hair, eyes, eyebrows, and face shape were changed sometime after the character was first seen, and he no longer has sunglasses; his own Japanese name as well as Craig\'s were also changed. The changes were made by the Japanese producers to avoid lawsuits from the makers of {{wp|Dokonjō Gaeru}}. As a result, several scenes needed to be completely reanimated and Yuriko Yamaguchi, [[Yōko Sōmi]], and [[Tetsu Inada]] (the respective voices of [[Nurse Joy]], [[Hamilton]], and [[Crasher Wake]]) had to re-record a few lines due to the name changes. Hamilton was meant to be a direct parody of the main character of the series, Hiroshi.\n* This is the first episode in which two voice actors return to the series - [[David Brimmer]] and [[Jason Griffith]].\n\n===Errors===\n* In the official dub numbering (as seen on Pokémon.com), this episode precedes \'\'[[DP071|Pokémon Ranger and the Kidnapped Riolu! (Part 1)]]\'\' and \'\'[[DP072|Pokémon Ranger and the Kidnapped Riolu! (Part 2)]]\'\'. However, this episode premiered on Cartoon Network after these two episodes, in more logical order. All repeats of the dub, both in the United States and worldwide, follow the official dub order.\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FCC|bordercolor=99F\n|zh_cmn={{tt|濕原大濕地的不良蛙祭典！？|The Croagunk Festival of the Shīyuán (Pastoria) Great Marsh!?}}\n|cs={{tt|Festival Croagunků|The Croagunk Festival}}\n|da={{tt|Den ypperste Croagunk af dem alle!|The greatest Croagunk of all!}}\n|de={{tt|Ein Tänzchen in Ehren...!|A little dance in honor...!}}\n|ko={{tt|삐딱구리 축제! 챔피언은 누구?|Croagunk Festival!
