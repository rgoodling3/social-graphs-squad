Full Battle 6 VS 6!!\'\') is the 269th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on October 10, 2002 and in the United States on September 20, 2003.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/06_07-the-ties-that-bind/-->\n<i>Ash is about to take on his long time rival, Gary Oak, in the next battle of the Johto League Silver Conference, and he\'s determined to do everything he can to win. He stays up all night researching strategies and trying to learn more about Gary\'s Pokémon. Gary has a lot of strong Pokémon, and he trains many different types, so Ash has to pick his team carefully. Gary starts out with Nidoqueen, and Ash uses Tauros. Gary wins the first round, but Ash takes the second. It\'s going to be a very close match! In round three, it\'s Ash\'s Heracross versus Gary\'s Blastoise. Who will win? (To be continued!)</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} is shocked to learn that his first round opponent in the Victory Tournament will be against {{Gary}}, his eternal rival. After a sharp exchange with Gary, Ash is left enraged by Gary threatening to sweep him at the tournament. That night, back in his suite, Ash rummages through his [[bag|backpack]] and shows his friends the smaller white half of the {{i|Poké Ball}}, and he proceeds to tell {{an|Misty}} and {{an|Brock}} the beginning of his and Gary\'s rivalry. It had been a few days before Ash first left to start his {{pkmn|journey}} as a [[Pokémon Trainer]]. [[Fishing]] by a stream, he managed to hook a {{p|Magikarp}}, which proceeded to slap him in the face before landing back into the water. Gary, on the other side of the stream, taunted Ash for being unable to name any of Magikarp\'s attacks, including the {{m|Flail}} that was used on him. The two had liked the stream as a fishing spot, and this caused their rivalry to escalate. When both Ash and Gary caught a bite, both reeled their lines in, but discovered that they had both hooked onto the same rusted Poké Ball. After a brief tug-of-war, the Ball broke in two. Though Ash was willing to accept that the "fishing battle" was a draw, Gary had declared it a loss, as "tying with Ash was just as bad as losing", a position that he continued to hold. Ash explains that he has kept his half of the Poké Ball as a good luck charm. He admits that losing to Gary and his [[Gary\'s Umbreon|Eevee]] had taught him that he wasn\'t ready to take him on at [[EP116|the time]], but declares that he\'ll beat Gary. Misty reminds him that the next day is a rest day, with the Victory Tournament starting on the day after, so Brock advises Ash to use tomorrow to prepare his strategy.\n\nThe next day, {{TRT}} reopens their newly expanded souvenir stand. Though {{MTR}} tells [[Jessie]] that business might be slow over the rest day, [[James]] is confident that he can drum up some business by holding a one-day sale of limited edition collector\'s pins. Meanwhile, back in the suite, Misty is surprised to learn that Ash and Brock had buried themselves in books, preparing for Ash\'s match. Ash, for one, has not slept since last night. Brock is quick to point out that Ash is not as computer-literate as either himself or Misty, but has managed to get a webpage up on Gary, displaying data on ten of his Pokémon. However, the monitor crashes just as he is about to demonstrate his computer skills to Misty, so she suggests they takes the opportunity to get Ash off the computer desk for breakfast.\n\nOutside, Ash and company continue discussing strategy. Brock notes that Gary has no particular [[type]] preference, just like {{an|Professor Oak|his grandfather}}, and that he keeps rotating his Pokémon. Ash confirms this, and says that he has been that way for as long as he has known him. As Brock reaffirms that his team-building strategy will be crucial, Ash sees a shadow flying overhead. Once again, the {{m|Flamethrower}} greeting is a dead giveaway that it is {{AP|Charizard}}, having arrived from the [[Charicific Valley]] after Brock made a late night request to {{jo|Liza}}. As Ash is greeting Charizard, Gary appears. After a frank exchange, the two stare each other down until Professor Oak arrives to break the silence, surprising both. {{Delia}} also appears, herself and Professor Oak having arrived to watch the [[Silver Conference]] live instead of on TV. Oak advises the two to lighten up before moving onto other matters. Having received a lot of new Pokémon data, Professor Oak updates the [[Pokédex]]es for both Ash and Gary. Though Misty and Brock are excited about the new Pokédex data and what they can learn from it, Gary stares at his Pokédex intently before leaving. Misty and Brock also remind Ash to prepare their strategy, so they also leave, with Delia offering Ash some encouraging words.\n\nLater that day, Meowth and Jessie congratulate themselves for selling out their merchandise yet again, thanks to the Trainers that did not advance to the Victory Tournament also buying their pins. James, however, is working even harder, as he adjusts his new machines to make 3000 new commemorative badges just to meet the demand for the next day.\n\nThe next day, the Victory Tournament begins in earnest. [[Macy]] and [[Vincent|Jackson]] are also in the crowd as the announcer explains the Victory Tournament conditions: a [[Full Battle]] with a random selection of battlefields between grass, water, rock, and ice-based fields. In the round\'s opening match, {{jo|Harrison}} easily advances onto the next round when his {{TP|Harrison|Sneasel}} defeats a {{p|Machamp}}. Back in the locker rooms, Ash congratulates Harrison on his victory. Harrison reminds Ash that he will square off against the winner of Ash\'s upcoming match against Gary. Back on the field, Misty and Brock have already been seated, with {{AP|Pikachu}}, {{TP|Misty|Togepi}}, {{TP|Misty|Politoed}}, and {{TP|Misty|Psyduck}} ready to cheer Ash on. However, Gary has also brought [[Gary\'s cheerleaders|his cheerleaders]] to cheer him on. After the announcer makes a brief note of Gary and Ash\'s accomplishments, the match begins on the rock field, and Gary is selected to choose his first Pokémon.\n\nGary leads off with {{p|Nidoqueen}}, while Ash calls on his {{AP|Tauros}}. Nidoqueen charges forward with a super-effective {{m|Rock Smash}} that sends rocks flying into the air, causing Tauros damage. Tauros manages to push through the oncoming rocks and rushes towards Nidoqueen with a {{m|Horn Attack}}. However, Gary orders Nidoqueen to grab Tauros by the horns. She then launches a close range {{m|Hyper Beam}}, easily knocking Tauros out of the match.\n\nAsh sends out {{AP|Heracross}} as his second Pokémon, so Gary swaps Nidoqueen out for a {{p|Magmar}}. Gary begins with a {{m|Flamethrower}}, but Heracross evades the attack and throws its opponent into the air with a {{m|Fury Attack}}. Magmar uses the increased altitude to its advantage, landing into its own {{m|Fire Blast}} before ramming straight into Heracross. The flames engulf Heracross, causing it massive damage. Adding insult to injury, Magmar also adds a point-blank Flamethrower to the mix to cripple Heracross. Suddenly, Heracross manages to blow the fire away with its wings. It charges towards Magmar with a {{m|Megahorn}}, which overpowers Magmar\'s Flamethrower defense, knocking it out.\n\nUnfazed, Gary sends out {{TP|Gary|Blastoise}} - the final form of his {{pkmn2|starter}}, and the most powerful Pokémon on his team. Heracross starts with a Fury Attack, but Blastoise responds with {{m|Hydro Pump}}. The two attacks prepare to collide as [[EP270|the battle wages on]].\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Gary}} is revealed to have obtained a {{p|Magmar}}, an {{p|Alakazam}}, a {{p|Houndoom}}, a {{p|Pinsir}}, a {{p|Fearow}}, a {{p|Kingdra}}, and a {{p|Skarmory}}.\n* [[Ash\'s Charizard]] returns from the [[Charicific Valley]].\n* {{Ash}} and Gary receive a [[Pokédex]] upgrade from {{an|Professor Oak}}.\n* {{jo|Harrison}} wins his first round [[Full Battle]], advancing to the quarterfinals.\n* Ash begins his first round Full Battle against Gary.\n* [[Ash\'s Tauros]] is revealed to know {{m|Horn Attack}}.\n* [[Ash\'s Heracross]] is revealed to know {{m|Megahorn}}.\n* Gary\'s [[starter Pokémon]] is revealed to have been a {{p|Squirtle}}, which has since evolved into a {{TP|Gary|Blastoise}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* [[Gary\'s Blastoise]]\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n[[File:PMTV EP269.png|thumb|200px|right|{{tt|Pocket Monster TV|Who\'s That Pokémon}}]]\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{Gary}}\n* {{an|Professor Oak}}\n* {{Delia}}\n* {{jo|Harrison}}\n* [[Vincent|Jackson]]\n* [[Macy]]\n* [[Charles Goodshow]]\n* [[Gary\'s cheerleaders]]\n* Crowd\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP EP269.png|thumb|200px|right|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Umbreon}} \'\'(U.S. and international)\'\', {{p|Tauros}} \'\'(Japan)\'\'\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Togepi}} ({{OP|Misty|Togepi}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Charizard}} ({{OP|Ash|Charizard}})\n* {{p|Tauros}} ({{OP|Ash|Tauros}})\n* {{p|Heracross}} ({{OP|Ash|Heracross}})\n* {{p|Psyduck}} ({{OP|Misty|Psyduck}})\n* {{p|Politoed}} ({{OP|Misty|Politoed}})\n* {{p|Blastoise}} ({{OP|Gary|Blastoise}})\n* {{p|Nidoqueen}} ({{Gary}}\'s)\n* {{p|Magmar}} ({{Gary}}\'s)\n* {{p|Pinsir}} ({{Gary}}\'s; on computer screen)\n* {{p|Houndoom}} ({{Gary}}\'s; on computer screen)\n* {{p|Fearow}} ({{Gary}}\'s; on computer screen)\n* {{p|Alakazam}} ({{Gary}}\'s; on computer screen)\n* {{p|Umbreon}} ({{OP|Gary|Umbreon}}; on computer screen)\n* {{p|Skarmory}} ({{Gary}}\'s; on computer screen)\n* {{p|Arcanine}} ({{OP|Gary|Arcanine}}; on computer screen)\n* {{p|Nidoqueen}} ({{Gary}}\'s; on computer screen)\n* {{p|Magmar}} ({{Gary}}\'s; on computer screen)\n* {{p|Kingdra}} ({{Gary}}\'s; on computer screen)\n* {{p|Sneasel}} ({{OP|Harrison|Sneasel}})\n* {{p|Machamp}} ({{pkmn|Trainer}}\'s)\n* {{p|Magikarp}} (flashback)\n\n==Trivia==\n* The English title of this episode is very similar to that of [[AG163|a future episode]].\n** Coincidentally, the \'\'{{wp|Justice League Unlimited}}\'\' cartoon series also has an episode titled the same.\n* When {{Ash}} is looking for his half of the broken {{i|Poké Ball}}, the rubber gloves and the clothesline {{Delia}} gave him in [[EP001|the first episode]] can be seen.\n* The {{pkmn|battle}} between Ash and {{Gary}} marks the first and currently only time in the {{pkmn|anime}} where {{AP|Pikachu}} isn\'t in Ash\'s active [[party]], though he is still present on the sidelines to cheer him on. Ash likely gave his Poké Ball to {{an|Professor Oak}}, at least temporarily, to make this possible. The fact that this occurs means that Pikachu is ineligible to battle, as Ash states in [[EP270|the next episode]].\n* During the flashback, Ash is seen wearing a straw hat, which may give the viewer the impression that the fight involving the rusted Poké Ball predates Ash winning his Pokémon League Hat at the raffle mentioned in \'\'[[EP025|Primeape Goes Bananas]]\'\'.\n* This episode is featured on \'\'Volume 5: Blastoise\'\' from [[Viz Media]]\'s {{OBP|Pokémon All-Stars|Region 1}} series.\n* This is the first time [[Ash\'s Heracross]] is seen using a move that is not a {{type|Normal}} one.\n* {{TRT}} doesn\'t recite the {{motto}} or blast off in this episode.\n\n===Errors===\n* After Ash told Misty and Brock about the broken Poké Ball, Ash was holding a whole Poké Ball instead of the lower white half that he has.\n* In one scene, Brock mispronounces {{jo|Liza}}\'s name.\n* In Harrison\'s battle, his Sneasel knocks out a Machamp, but both the official, the announcer and the Machamp itself, refer to it as a {{p|Machoke}}.\n* Ash sends out his {{AP|Tauros}} from a regular Poké Ball instead of a [[Safari Ball]].\n* When Tauros is knocked out by Nidoqueen\'s {{m|Hyper Beam}}, the announcer says that Nidoqueen defeated Tauros with just one attack. However, this is incorrect, since Tauros was previously hit by Nidoqueen\'s {{m|Rock Smash}}.\n* When Brock was listing types that would match up well against {{AP|Heracross}}, one of the types he mentions is {{t|Rock}}. While this is true for a {{type|Bug}} Pokémon, it is not true for Heracross, since its secondary type is {{t|Fighting}}, which is resistant to Rock-type moves.\n* Heracross\'s {{m|Fury Attack}} is incorrectly referred to as {{m|Fury Swipes}} in the dub. In addition, Heracross [[Anime move errors|cannot legally learn]] Fury Swipes.\n* The announcer mentions {{m|Megahorn}} as the single most powerful Pokémon attack. However, Fire Blast is equally powerful, and moves such as {{m|Explosion}} are more powerful still. However, it is the most powerful {{type|Bug}} attack, not counting {{m|Fury Cutter}} at max power (in the original version, it is correctly stated that Megahorn is the most powerful \'\'Bug-type\'\' attack).\n* Gary\'s Blastoise\'s lower jaw was miscolored blue instead of tan in the scene where Blastoise uses {{m|Hydro Pump}}.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:EP269 error.png|Ash holding the "whole" broken Poké Ball\nFile:EP269 Error.png|The miscolored jaw\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n* In the English dub, {{an|Brock}} and {{an|Misty}} seem to be aware that Gary\'s starter Pokémon was {{p|Squirtle}}, as when {{TP|Gary|Blastoise}} sent out, Misty asks, "Wait, isn\'t that...?". Brock replies, "The same Squirtle Gary originally received from Professor Oak? Yeah, that\'s the one." This is not the case in the original Japanese version, as they were surprised that Gary owned a Blastoise.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|zh_cmn={{tt|決勝錦標賽！全面作戰6VS6！！！|Championship Finals!
