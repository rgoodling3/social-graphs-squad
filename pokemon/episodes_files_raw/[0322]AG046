(Japanese: '''かちぬきファミリー！４VS４！！''' ''{{tt|Kachinuki|Winstrate}} Family! 4 vs 4!!'') is the 46th episode of the {{series|Advanced Generation}}, and the 320th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on October 9, 2003 and in the United States on October 9, 2004. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/07_05-candid-camerupt/-->\n<i>Ash and his friends are walking through the desert when they pass out because of the heat. They are rescued by the Winstrate Family, who in return for the hospitality offered, want to have a Pokémon battle between the four Winstrates and all four of the kids.\n\nTeam Rocket also faints in the desert, where they are discovered by Vito Winstrate. He left home a while ago to battle in the Pokémon League, but he'd rather just raise Pokémon. His family is very proud of him going off to the League, and he's afraid of them finding out the truth. James offers to help him talk to his family.\n\nThe battle begins back at the Winstrate residence. Brock uses his Mudkip against Victor Winstrate's Zigzagoon, but is knocked out by a surprise Thunderbolt attack. May takes out Victoria's Roselia with her Beautifly. Max doesn't have any Pokémon yet, so he borrows Ash's Corphish and easily knocks down Vivi's Marill, breaking the little girl's heart.\n\nAsh takes on Grandma with Pikachu. The battle is close until her Camerupt uses Eruption and begins to chase Pikachu everywhere. Camerupt gets confused and charges the Winstrate's house instead.\n\nVito and Team Rocket are watching the whole thing, so Vito secretly has his Alakazam start a rainstorm to calm Camerupt down. Team Rocket tries to steal Pikachu but Vito uses his Pokémon to stop them.  Grandma Winstrate realizes that Vito is helping them and never went to the Pokémon League. She announces that it's okay for Vito to choose his own path. Vito leaves the Winstrate farm, to become the best he can be at raising Pokémon.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nOn their way to [[Fallarbor Town]], {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} grow weary as they walk through a desert with no water left. {{AP|Pikachu}} faints due to heat exhaustion, and soon the other four do the same. They are brought to an isolated farmhouse by {{p|Camerupt}} and [[Winstrate family|Victoria]], and quickly recover after a sip of water. Victoria and her family—Victor, Vicky, and Vivi—are farmers, and admit they don't get visitors often. Victoria adds that her eldest son Vito, who left two months earlier on a quest of his own to become the [[Hoenn League]] Champion. Meanwhile {{TRT}} are trapped in the heat of the desert too. Soon they collapse from exhaustion, through Vito, who is passing by, gives them food and water. [[James]] says Vito should be getting home, but Vito explains that his situation is a bit complicated. He doesn’t want to disappoint his family after realizing that he prefers raising and taking care of Pokémon rather than battling with them. James empathizes with Vito since he ran away from home after not living up to his family's expectations, and offers to help Vito out.\n\nAfter Ash and the others recover, they offer to do something in return for the help they received. In response, the family reintroduces themselves as the Winstrate family, and challenge the group to a four-on-four Pokémon battle. Vivi adds that because there is no one else around, they get bored battling each other. Ash points out that [[Max]] doesn’t have any Pokémon. In response Max declares that he will simply borrow one of Ash’s Pokémon. With that sorted, the Winstrate escort the group over to their purpose-built battlefield, complete with stadium seating and lights. The battle starts its first round with Victor and his {{p|Zigzagoon}} versus {{an|Brock}} and his {{TP|Brock|Mudkip}}. Mudkip opens with a {{m|Water Gun}}, which Zigzagoon dodges. Zigzagoon shockingly responds with a {{m|Thunderbolt}}, ending the battle with just that one [[move]]. Vivi explains that since there are no power plants around, the family taught Zigzagoon that move to generate power for them. The second round begins with Victoria and {{p|Roselia}} versus {{an|May}} and {{TP|May|Beautifly}}. May immediately gets fired up by Roselia due to her rival [[Drew]] having a {{TP|Drew|Roselia}} as well. Beautifly whips up a {{m|Gust}} quickly followed by {{m|Silver Wind}}, both of which hit their target and Roselia goes down, ending the battle. Vicky is disappointed in Victoria’s efforts, uttering under her breathe that she should have gone with another Pokémon\n\n[[Max]] and {{AP|Corphish}} take on Vivi and her {{p|Marill}} in the third clash. Max has trouble concentrating because he has a crush on Vivi, but he quickly regains his composure when Brock calls out to him. Max tries to instruct Corphish to wait for Marill to attack, and block with {{m|Harden}} to exhaust its opponent. However, Corphish doesn't listen, and batters Marill with its pincers to win the round. Vivi gets angry with Max and says she hates him, breaking Max's heart. The final match is between Ash and Vicky, though since the Winstrate family has lost two of the three rounds, the worst-case scenario for Ash is that the battle ends in a tie. Meanwhile, Vito and the Rocket trio arrive at the front of the house, with James continuing to be confident that he can talk to Vito's grandmother, Vicky, about Vito not becoming Hoenn League Champion. Since the house is empty, Vito assumes that the family is on the Pokémon battlefield, so they go there and begin watching the battle between Ash and Vicky in hiding.\n\nVicky sends out her {{p|Camerupt}} and while Ash chooses {{AP|Pikachu}} and immediately sends out a {{m|Thunderbolt}}, which is a direct hit. However, since Camerupt is a {{type|Ground}}, the Thunderbolt has no effect. Ash and Pikachu try again with a {{m|Quick Attack}}, which knocks Camerupt to the ground. Vicky orders it to get up and asks it to show its strength for Vito, unaware her grandson is watching the match. Camerupt gets up and uses {{m|Sandstorm}}, followed by a {{m|Take Down}}, but Pikachu lands an {{m|Iron Tail}} to the face first. Vito and the rest of the family pull out hard hats and warn the others to find cover, and Vicky reveals that Camerupt have a nasty habit of getting uncontrollably angry after being hit in the face and use {{m|Eruption}}. Sure enough that's what happens leaving Ash and his friends to run in fear of the flaming rocks from Eruption, with a couple of the rocks hitting Team Rocket. In anger they take off, leaving Vito to talk to his grandmother on his own.\n\nCamerupt continues to chase Pikachu around the field with its Eruption going off, but Pikachu trips on a ledge and narrowly evades being trampled. Camerupt, however, continues to rampage straight towards the family's crops, so Vito sends out his {{p|Alakazam}} and tells it to use {{m|Rain Dance}} to stop Camerupt. The wet weather instantly calms Camerupt in time, stopping it before reaching the crops. No one realizes where the rain came from and assume it was luck. Thankful, Vicky concedes the battle to Ash, but the joy doesn't last long Team Rocket appear in their [[Team Rocket's mechas|balloon]] and take Pikachu. Vito realizes that the three aren't as good as he thought, and they announce how grateful they are to Vito for leading them there so they could capture Pikachu. The family is shocked to hear Vito's name, and Vito decides to pay Team Rocket back by using Alakazam's {{m|Psychic}} attack to rescue Pikachu. Team Rocket tries to steal Pikachu again, but Vito summons his {{p|Swellow}} and has it use {{m|Wing Attack}} on Team Rocket's balloon, sending them blasting off. \n\nVicky recognizes the Swellow and knows Vito is hiding nearby. Vicky talks loudly enough for Vito to hear, and she admits she shouldn't have pushed Vito to become a Pokémon Trainer. She continues by saying that whatever Vito wants to accomplish, his family is right behind him. Vito is thankful for his grandmother's words, and without revealing himself, he leaves to make his dreams come true. Ash and the others get ready to leave, so as a send-off the family puts their hard hats on again and has Camerupt use Eruption. The group runs off in fear, continuing on their journey to Fallarbor Town.\n\n==Major events==\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Swellow}}\n\n=====TV episode debuts=====\n* {{p|Camerupt}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Drew]] (flashback)\n* [[Winstrate family]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:PTC AG046.png|thumb|200px|right|Pokémon Trainer's Choice]]\n[[Pokémon Trainer's Choice]]: {{p|Nuzleaf}}\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Corphish}} ({{OP|Ash|Corphish}})\n* {{p|Beautifly}} ({{OP|May|Beautifly}})\n* {{p|Mudkip}} ({{OP|Brock|Mudkip}})\n* {{p|Roselia}} ({{OP|Drew|Roselia}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Camerupt}} ([[Winstrate family|Vicky Winstrate]]'s)\n* {{p|Zigzagoon}} ([[Winstrate family|Victor Winstrate]]'s)\n* {{p|Roselia}} ([[Winstrate family|Victoria Winstrate]]'s)\n* {{p|Marill}} ([[Winstrate family|Vivi Winstrate]]'s)\n* {{p|Alakazam}} ([[Winstrate family|Vito Winstrate]]'s)\n* {{p|Swellow}} ([[Winstrate family|Vito Winstrate]]'s; debut)\n\n==Trivia==\n* The English dub title is based on the television series ''{{wp|Candid Camera}}'', possibly to describe the way Vito was watching the family from a distance without being noticed.\n* This episode was aired in English exactly one year after the Japanese airdate.\n\n===Errors===\n* In one shot, Ash's left thumb is colored black, like his glove.\n* When Brock sends out his {{TP|Brock|Mudkip}}, its mouth doesn't move when it says its name.\n\n<gallery>\nAG046 error.png|The thumb error\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n* In the Hungama TV dub, all of May's speculations and references to the possibility of a romantic relationship brewing between Max and Vivi are diluted to the level of just a 'good friendship', for obvious reasons.\n\n====[[Pokémon Trainer's Choice]]====\n* Question: Trainers, which of these Pokémon is the best choice to battle {{p|Camerupt}}?\n* Choices: {{p|Beedrill}}, {{p|Nuzleaf}}, {{p|Magcargo}}\n* Answer: OK, Trainers! If you chose {{p|Nuzleaf}}, you were right!\n* The Pokémon Trainer's Choice states that Nuzleaf would be best against Camerupt. However, Nuzleaf would be less effective as Camerupt is a {{type|Fire}}. In truth, none of the Pokémon would be effective battle choices, though Magcargo would suffer the least damage from Camerupt's Fire attacks, due to its {{t|Rock}} and Fire-types, but also has a double weakness against Camerupt's Ground attacks.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=9999FF|bordercolor=FF7777\n|zh_cmn={{tt|戰鬥家庭四比四！|Battling Family, 4 VS 4!}}\n|nl={{tt|De kokend hete Camerupt|A Boiling Hot Camerupt}}\n|da={{tt|Uheldigt udbrud!|an unlucky eruption!}}\n|de={{tt|Camerupt außer Rand und Band!|Camerupt goes wild!}}\n|fi={{tt|Tulinen Camerupt|The fiery Camerupt}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Chaude journée|Hot day}}\n|he=ההתפרצות{{tt|hitpartsut|Eruption}}\n|it={{tt|La famiglia Vinci|The Winstrate family}}\n|ko={{tt|황보가문과 4대4 시합|4 VS 4 Battle with the Winstrate Family}}\n|no={{tt|Skjult Camerupt!|Hidden Camerupt!}}\n|pt_br={{tt|O Fervoroso Camerupt!|The Zealous Camerupt!}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|O Desinteressado Camerupt!|The Disinterested Camerupt!}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Conozcan a Camerupt!|Meet Camerupt!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Un Camerupt cándido|A candid Camerupt}}\n|sv={{tt|Familjen Winstrate!|The Winstrate family!}}\n|ru={{tt|Старина Камерапт|Camerupt's old man}}\n|hi=Camerupt का ज्वालामुखी! {{tt|''Camerupt ka Jwalamukhi''|Camerupt's Volcano}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n}}\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=AG045 |\nprevtitle=A Togepi Mirage! |\nnextcode=AG047 |\nnexttitle=I Feel Skitty! |\nseries=Advanced Generation series |\ncolorscheme=Hoenn}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0320}}\n[[Category:Advanced Generation series episodes|046]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Junki Takegami]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Shin Katakai]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Masahiko Watanabe]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Izumi Shimura]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Max]]\n\n[[de:Camerupt außer Rand und Band!]]\n[[es:EP322]]\n[[fr:AG046]]\n[[it:AG046]]\n[[ja:AG編第46話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 超世代 第46集]]"}
