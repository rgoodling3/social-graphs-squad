Suddenly, they encounter the Legendary Pokémon Kyogre! They learn that it’s been poisoned and is being pursued by a group of sinister Pokémon hunters. But the hunters underestimate our heroes’ skills and determination, and Kyogre is healed when Lana coaxes it to swallow an Antidote. Kyogre is still angry, but after Brionne evolves into Primarina and sings a beautiful melody, the Legendary Pokémon calms down enough for Lana to express her admiration for it. This is one adventure Lana and Primarina will never forget!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashcl}} are out [[fishing]] for the day. As {{an|Kiawe}} becomes frustrated over his inability to catch anything, {{an|Mallow}} reels in a {{p|Bruxish}}, but it decides to let go of the line and tries to bite Mallow, forcing {{TP|Mallow|Tsareena}} to kick it away. Meanwhile, {{an|Sophocles}} bides his time and watches his digital screen before pulling up his catch, a particularly large {{p|Pyukumuku}}. Sophocles\'s catch proves to be too heavy, and Pyukumuku latches onto Kiawe\'s face before it is returned. Then, {{TP|Kiawe|Turtonator}} feels something tugging on its tail and pulls it up to reveal an {{p|Octillery}}, which only annoys Kiawe more. Sophocles notices that {{an|Lana}} and Ash are missing, but {{an|Lillie}} points them out in the distance. The pair is floating across the ocean in two of {{TP|Lana|Brionne}}\'s bubbles. Ash calls for a race, and Lana accepts. Brionne promptly dives underwater and gives Lana a push forward. Ash chases her, leaving their friends behind.\n\nLater on, Kiawe finally hooks something. However, it is particularly strong and begins to pull Kiawe towards the water. His friends and the Pokémon add their strength, but they continue to struggle. Kiawe finally heaves his catch, a {{p|Cloyster}}, out of the water, but it immediately clamps onto Kiawe\'s head. Tsareena kicks Cloyster back into the depths, freeing Kiawe from suffocation.\n\nMeanwhile, Lana and Ash are left exhausted from their race and take a moment to catch their breaths. Suddenly a giant whirlpool beings to swirl, sending the pair into the vortex. Brionne does its ample best to reach Lana, but a {{p|Kyogre}} swims passed them. In its wake, Lana and Ash are sent flying onto a rocky exposed reef, soon enough Brionne joins them ashore. Ash turns to see a steep cliff, so he and {{AP|Pikachu}} climb it with ease. With their heightened vantage point the pair spot a Kyogre staring back at them. Lana soon joins them and thrilled to see Kyogre. She suddenly notices that it glowing purple, red and blue as well as breathing heavily, so she assumes it must be unwell. The pair rush down and Pikachu is immediately concerned by Kyogre’s ill state. Lana grabs her fishing rod with one of [[Misty\'s special lure]]s attached to the end. Ash is surprised to see Lana having one, and she explains that {{an|Misty}} gave the lure to her recently. Lana attaches some bait to the lure, laced with [[Antidote]] to heal Kyogre\'s suspected {{status|poison}}ing. She throws out her line, but Kyogre doesn\'t take to it. Lana urges Kyogre to grab the bait when a {{p|Seismitoad}} attacks her.\n\nAsh and Lana look around them as a {{p|Carvanha}} submarine suddenly appears. A hunter named [[Hunter D]] emerges from the hull and with a click of his fingers a pair of [[Hunter D\'s crew members|crew members]] and their {{p|Palpitoad}} appear. The crew members snare Kyogre in an electric net, inflicting significant pain onto the [[Legendary Pokémon]]. The leader radios into his grunts before capturing Kyogre in a yellow beam and beginning to drag it further out to sea. Ash informs Lana that a Pokémon Hunter is someone who captures Pokémon for a profit. Lana is immediately irritated and prepares to cast out her line to save Kyogre the mistreatment. Hunter D\'s Seismitoad leaps towards her, though [[Sandy]] batters it away. Seismitoad attempts a poisonous attack, though Brionne strikes back with a {{m|Bubble Beam}} as Sandy knocks it into a nearby cliff. Lana thanks her Pokémon for their efforts and begins to walk towards Kyogre again. Hunter D is furious and orders his crew members to surround the interfering duo. Ash calls out all of his Pokémon to join the fight. {{AP|Lycanroc}} and {{AP|Torracat}} rush ahead, evading a {{m|Mud Bomb}} in the process. Lycanroc unleashes a {{m|Stone Edge}}, but the Palpitoad back-flips to evade the attack. Torracat, however, knocks it into the water with a {{m|Fire Blast}}. The second crew member orders a {{m|Hydro Pump}} which Pikachu narrowly sidesteps to avoid. Pikachu crashes into Palpitoad with a {{m|Quick Attack}}, and Sandy uses the cliff\'s heights to land a powerful overhead {{m|Double-Edge}}. Ash turns his attention to Hunter D\'s submarine and has {{AP|Rowlet}} strike it with a {{m|Seed Bomb}}. Rowlet promptly swallows its precious [[Everstone]] again as {{AP|Meltan}} lands onto the submarine.\n\nLana throws her line again and pleads for Kyogre to grab a hold of it. Hunter D continues to pull Kyogre out to sea, he then orders his Seismitoad to attack Lana. Pikachu leaps to Lana\'s aid with an {{m|Iron Tail}} and knocks Seismitoad into a cliff with its own {{m|Focus Blast}} attack. Lana tries again, and this time Kyogre takes a large mouthful of water and chomps onto the lure. She maintains her grip as she is now being dragged out as well. The Palpitoad duo attempt another ambush, but Torracat\'s {{m|Flame Charge}} and Lycanroc\'s {{m|Accelerock}} batters the threats away. Ash and Lana\'s other Pokémon continue to fight off the Palpitoad and Seismitoad, while Lana holds steady despite the increasing wake. Meltan\'s taste for metal proves useful as it begins to eat its way through Hunter D\'s metal sub. One of the crew members inside the sub radios into the boss to alert him that the tractor beam is quickly losing power. Hunter D calls for a change of plans; trap Kyogre inside the sub. The Carvanha submarine stops its tractor beam and hinges its jaw wide open to grab the target. However, Kyogre appears to have regained some of its strength. The Legendary lets out a mighty roar which {{a|Drizzle|summons dark clouds}} that cover the sky. A torrential rain begins to fall, and the sudden change of conditions also draws Lillie and the others\' attentions further away. Ash quickly recalls all of his Pokémon to their {{i|Poké Ball}}s. Kyogre leaps from the water and the resulting wake washes over Ash and Lana. Brionne saves Ash, Pikachu and Sandy with its bubbles. As for Lana, she continues to hold onto her line and Kyogre, who soon drags her into the ocean depths. It gives Hunter D\'s submarine a flick with its tail and sends them blasting off. Hunter D and his two crew members land directly in front of [[Officer Jenny]], who was enjoying a day on the beach.\n\nMeanwhile, Brionne attempts to reach Lana, but Kyogre\'s speed is unparalleled. In its desperation, Brionne bursts into a brilliant blue light and promptly [[Evolution|evolves]] into a {{p|Primarina}}. Kyogre suddenly lets go of the fishing line and Primarina goes onto rescue Lana. Ash, Pikachu and Sandy watch in amazement as Primarina emerges from the water in a vertical leap. Kyogre suddenly freezes over the water using {{m|Sheer Cold}} to create an icy refuge from the swirling seas. Lana realizes that Kyogre is still angry and sets herself the task of finally reeling the Legendary in. Ash is left baffled when Lana climbs aboard Primarina and simply leaps back into the treacherous seas. Lana casts her line once more and soon enough Kyogre bites onto it. She urges Primarina to keep swimming as she tries to hold onto her big catch. Kyogre makes the task challenging as it performs bounding leaps and tossing rolls. Primarina maneuvers Lana without any trouble. Lana suddenly reels Kyogre into the air and orders Primarina to sing. Primarina performs a melodic opera that calms Kyogre as it leaps over the duo. The subsequent wake ends the performance and the skies instantly clear. Later Lana and Primarina swim out to their new friend, Kyogre, to thank it for the precious moment. Kyogre swims back and with a roar it destroys its Sheer Cold island, sending Ash, Sandy and Pikachu into the water. A spectacular sprinkle of ice concludes the encounter.\n\nLana and Ash return to their friends, however they believe Lana\'s latest story is just another one of her jokes. She assures them of her miraculous tale and proudly presents her newly-evolved Primarina. Ash goes to detail the encounter with some onomatopoeia, instantly hooking his classmates into the elaborate story. Rotom is disappointed that it missed out on recording everything.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
