It first aired in Japan on November 15, 2012 and in the United States on March 2, 2013.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/16_05-team-eevee-and-the-pokemon-rescue-squad/-->\n<i>On their way to Vertress City, site of the Unova League, our heroes encounter a rockslide in their path. Ash and Iris try to climb over it, and it gives way under their feet! But a young man with an Eevee comes to the rescue, and his Espeon uses Psychic to float Ash and Iris out of danger.\n\nTheir rescuer’s name is Virgil, and he—along with his older brother, Davy, and their father, Jeff—are part of the Pokémon Rescue Squad, dedicated to helping others in need. The squad consists of several teams, and Virgil’s team is called Team Eevee because it includes Eevee and all seven of its evolutions!\n\nSoon, the squad receives a distress call from a nearby dam. Davy flies there to investigate and discovers that the entire lake and the dam’s control room have been frozen, knocking out the power and trapping a worker in the elevator. He evacuates the other workers, but a wild Cryogonal’s attack traps him inside the control room with the door frozen shut!\n\nThat means it’s Virgil’s turn to launch a rescue. Our heroes decide rescuing people with the help of Pokémon sounds like a great thing, so they come along to help! Virgil’s task is to recharge the emergency batteries to get the power back up and running. Iris and Cilan distract the five angry Cryogonal who are responsible for the crisis, and Ash and Virgil find the batteries and recharge them with the help of Jolteon and Pikachu.\n\nOnce power is restored, Davy goes to investigate the strange noises coming from the control room’s basement. There he finds the cause of the incident: a smaller Cryogonal trapped behind some pipes! He frees it with his Darmanitan’s help, and then discovers that Virgil’s Eevee has made a tunnel to rescue him using Dig.\n\nOur heroes, Virgil, and Davy are soon reunited, and the little Cryogonal returns to its friends, who happily float away. The dam is thawed, the workers are safe, and thanks to Eevee’s heroic actions, it’s promoted as a full member of Team Eevee!\n\nBefore saying good-bye, Virgil reveals that he and Eevee won all eight Unova Gym badges on their journey together, and they’re planning to enter the Unova League too! Ash looks forward to an exciting new rivalry as our heroes resume their trek to Vertress City.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nOn their way to the [[Vertress City]], {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} come across a bunch of giant boulders that block the path. {{an|Cilan}} proposes to look for another path, but Ash thinks they can easily climb over the rocks and {{an|Iris}} agrees. However, the boulders begin to move and fall into the cliff, causing Ash and Iris to fall as well. Just in time, they are saved by a man who has his {{p|Espeon}} use {{m|Psychic}}.\n\nThe man introduces himself as [[Virgil]], a rescue worker. The group thanks him and Espeon for saving them. Virgil explains that he is part of a rescue group with various teams and his team is called "Team {{p|Eevee}}". He says he owns Eevee and seven of the [[Eeveelution]]s. The group becomes fascinated about this and they want to see his complete team, to which Virgil agrees. The group follows Virgil to his ranch. There, Virgil shows all the Eeveelutions he currently owns. Virgil explains about his past, that as a child, he got lost his forest with his very first Eevee. This Eevee evolved into {{p|Umbreon}} and used {{m|Flash}} to help him get out of the forest. This is the reason that Virgil became interested in training different Eevee.\n\nVirgil then introduces his currently unevolved Eevee (and the only female of the group), which is still in training. They suddenly hear an alarm and a helicopter piloted by Virgil\'s older brother [[Davy]] comes out of a nearby barn. Davy tells Virgil that he will head to the emergency at a nearby dam with his {{p|Stoutland}}. The group then rush to the Virgil\'s father to hear about what happened. He explains that a {{p|Cryogonal}} has frozen the dam.\n\nDavy arrives at the dam and he has his Stoutland search for the location where the men are trapped in the building. They are trapped in a control house with a frozen door. Davy sends out his {{p|Bisharp}} which uses {{m|Slash}} to open the door. Davy leads the trapped men out of the building. The rampaging Cryogonal suddenly appears and freezes the door of the control house once again, now with Davy and Stoutland inside. Davy calls his father that he is trapped in the building. Virgil decides to go to help his brother and Ash and the group propose to help out as well.\n\nThey arrive at the dam and Davy gives Virgil the location where he got trapped. Virgil sends out his {{p|Flareon}} which uses {{m|Flamethrower}} to melt the frozen door. However, Virgil finds that door is locked and sends out Umbreon and {{p|Glaceon}}. He orders Glaceon to use {{m|Icy Wind}} on the keyhole while Umbreon uses Psychic to create a key. But then he finds out that the door is rusted. He sends out his {{p|Vaporeon}} to use {{m|Bubble Beam}} on the door and it finally opens.\n\nThey open the door but find that Davy is not there. It is completely dark due to the power failure, but Virgil has his Umbreon to use Flash. The group arrives at the power generator and find out that its batteries are low. Virgil sends out {{p|Jolteon}} to use {{m|Thunderbolt}} to power it up. Ash has {{AP|Pikachu}} help as well and together they manage to get the power back on. Meanwhile, Davy finds another worker at the elevator. After leaving the generator room Virgil, Ash and the rest of the group are attacked by a Cryogonal. Ash insists that Virgil goes on ahead while they stay behind and battle the Cryogonal. Virgil agrees and heads to the room that Davy and the other worker are trapped in. Meanwhile, Ash sends out {{AP|Pignite}} and orders him to use Flamethrower. When the Cryogonal is hit two more Cryogonal appear. Ash and his friends run to get away from the Cryogonal. They find Virgil and notice that he is battling two other Cryogonal. Eevee {{m|dig}}s a hole and gets into the building in which Davy and the other worker are trapped.\n\nEevee then leads them out through the hole after rescuing a Cryogonal trapped behind some pipes. Once they get out the Cryogonal notice that Virgil, Ash and his friends were only trying to help the other Cryogonal, as they thought it was being help captive. The Cryogonal leave and Virgil and Ash\'s Flareon and Pignite use Flamethrower to melt all the ice. They then go back to the ranch. As Ash and his friends are about to leave, they find out that Virgil is also attending the [[Unova League]].\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
