It first aired in Japan on August 1, 2002 and in the United States on August 16, 2003. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/05_49-entei-at-your-own-risk/-->\n<i>As Ash and friends continue their travels with Larvitar, it remains wary of all other Pokémon and people, particularly of Misty. They stop briefly at a Hot Springs, and there meet a young trainer who reports that he is there searching for an Entei. Jessie and James disguise themselves as snow cone salespeople and trap Ash and friends, but using their Pokémon these trainers are quick to escape. Ash than challenges the Entei-seeking trainer to a battle in hopes of learning more about the secret attack that this trainer claims his Misdreavus will use to defeat Entei. This secret weapon turns out to be Mean Look, an attack that prevents one\'s opponent from leaving a battle. Moments after this battle, the enthusiastic young trainer runs off toward a sensor that is detecting the presence of Entei. Ash and friends follow, soon after witnessing a battle between this trainer and Entei. The battle doesn\'t go exactly as this trainer had planned, but leaves him nonetheless with a renewed respect for Entei.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{ashfr|The group}} is on their way to [[Mt. Silver]], with [[Ash\'s Larvitar]] napping peacefully in his [[bag|backpack]]. It wakes up, but {{m|Harden}}s in fear when {{an|Misty}} and {{an|Brock}} talk to it. {{Ash}} snuggles Larvitar, promising to protect it from scary {{pkmn|Trainer}}s like Misty, which leads to criticisms from Brock that Ash is babying it. Misty tells him that he needs to see how it has improved around other Pokémon. At that moment, a very angry wild {{p|Ursaring}} comes out of the scrub and chases the group away, firing {{m|Hyper Beam}}s.\n\nHaving lost the Ursaring, the group stops to catch their breaths. Larvitar then wanders over and discovers a hot spring. Brock notices a variety of [[wild Pokémon]] sitting serenely in the hot water. Ash walks forward to test the water, but sets off an alarm by breaking a trip wire with his foot. A boy walks out from the growth, calling a challenge to {{p|Entei}}, only to discover the group instead. He explains that he has studied all of the recent Entei sightings and determined that it is next due to appear at the springs. He introduces himself as [[Nelson]]. Just then, the Ursaring comes bursting from the scrub, roaring. However, it doesn\'t pay attention to the group, instead diving into the springs, emerging with a roar of pleasure. Nelson explains that the springs have relaxation and even healing powers on Pokémon.\n\nAfter Nelson leaves to check his other sites, Ash releases his Pokémon to enjoy the springs. {{AP|Totodile}} goes jogging towards the water eagerly, but lands on its face when Ash calls for it to wait. Ash introduces his team to Larvitar, who quickly hides shyly. Totodile happily jogs up and seizes Larvitar by the hand and spins it around joyfully. It crashes into {{AP|Cyndaquil}}, causing both to freeze in fear. It also does not respond well to {{AP|Bayleef}}\'s cradling or her lullaby, and is severely intimidated by {{AP|Noctowl}}. Despite Ash\'s assurance that the group are his and therefore Larvitar\'s friends, Larvitar bursts into earsplitting {{m|Screech|tears}}. Later on, Larvitar has recovered and appears encouraged by Ash, Misty and Brock\'s Pokémon, save for the {{type|Rock}} {{TP|Brock|Onix}} and {{TP|Brock|Geodude}} enjoying the springs. However, Larvitar flinches away after being splashed by {{TP|Misty|Psyduck}} as it flails around in an attempt to swim. Misty attempts to get Psyduck into the springs, but it ends up trapped in hot sand. Brock discovers that it is pleasantly warm, and sends out his Onix and Geodude to enjoy it with Psyduck; Onix promptly buries Psyduck in sand as it makes a bed for itself. Geodude lands behind Larvitar, and shoves the young Rock-type head first into the sand. However, Larvitar enjoys the sand and Ash notes that it\'s finally beginning to enjoy itself. Later, Cyndaquil and Totodile start a sand ball fight, but when {{TP|Misty|Togepi}} hits Larvitar, it does not take it with Totodile\'s humor and promptly begins to cry again.\n\nWatching close by are [[Jessie]], [[James]] and {{MTR}}, with the latter two noting that the last thing they want in {{TRT}} is another screamer. However, they plot to steal Larvitar anyway, with Meowth hatching his "At the Bath Fruit Smoothie Plan". A [[List of Team Rocket\'s disguises|disguised]] Jessie and James pull up in a large truck and recite their {{motto}}, before offering the group some free taste test smoothies. Misty and Brock are suspicious, but Ash waves away their queries and takes Larvitar, Pikachu and his other Pokémon into the back of the truck. Suddenly the ramp retracts and the door slams shut. Team Rocket speeds away, gloating to Misty and Brock.\n\nIn the back, Jessie and James slide back a panel and taunt Ash, causing him to realize the deception and he plans to break out. However, despite all of his Pokémon\'s efforts to tackle open the door, not even Bayleef makes a dent. Pikachu then attempts a {{m|Thunderbolt}}, succeeding only in shocking everyone in the back while Jessie and James gleefully proclaim that {{t|Electric}} attacks are useless in their anti-electrified truck. Cyndaquil unleashes a {{m|Flamethrower}}, succeeding only in making the metal glow. Ash then remembers the hot-cold technique to rapidly expand and shrink the metal, and orders his two starters to alternate between {{m|Water Gun}} and Flamethrower attacks until Bayleef\'s {{m|Razor Leaf}} cleaves straight through the metal. Noctowl then grabs {{AP|Phanpy}} and Cyndaquil and flies out, while Ash and the others cling to Bayleef, whose {{m|Vine Whip}} seizes a nearby branch and Ash\'s group is yanked to safety. Ash’s loses a hold of Larvitar while making his landing, though a {{p|Misdreavus}} catches Larvitar in time and returns it to Ash. Ash thanks it for the rescue and checks his [[Pokédex]] for more information. Nelson then runs up, revealing the Misdreavus to be his. Misty and Brock come running to catch up, and they meet Misdreavus, Misty exclaiming it to be pretty. Nelson then challenges Ash to a {{pkmn|battle}}, promising to show off his Pokémon\'s special [[move]] that he claims will help him catch Entei. Team Rocket later discovers to their horror that Ash has escaped.\n\nBrock referees a two-on-two {{pkmn|battle}}, and Ash\'s Phanpy volunteers to fight first. Phanpy\'s {{m|Take Down}} overcomes Misdreavus\' {{m|Headbutt}}, and Misdreavus\' {{m|Swift}} is blocked by {{m|Defense Curl}}. However, Phanpy\'s attempt to dodge with a {{m|Rollout}} fails and the {{m|Psybeam}} attack scores a direct hit, confusing Phanpy. Nelson then reveals his secret attack, {{m|Mean Look}}, which Ash notes doesn\'t seem to have done anything. On Misty\'s advice, Ash tries to recall Phanpy, but the {{i|Poké Ball}} does not recall Phanpy. Nelson explains that Mean Look prevents substitutions in battle, or [[Escape|fleeing]] in wild Pokémon, and that he plans to use it to capture Entei. \n\nSuddenly, Team Rocket arrives again and swipes Misdreavus in a net. After reciting the motto, they unleash a huge vacuum, attached to their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|Meowth balloon]], to suck up all of the water and wild Pokémon in the hot spring. Brock\'s Onix shelters the Trainer\'s Pokémon, allowing [[Misty\'s Staryu]] to escape the water in time, but Brock\'s {{TP|Brock|Pineco}} is not quick enough and is sucked up in the vacuum. In despair, Brock leaps into the typhoon of water after his Pokémon, managing to catch Pineco until the Ursaring crashes into him and knocks him away. Pineco is upset by this, and [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Forretress}}. The evolution induces an explosion of energy that breaks the waterspout, causing Brock, Forretress, and the wild Pokémon to land in the water. Bayleef then uses Razor Leaf to break Misdreavus free, allowing it to return to Nelson. In fury, Meowth unleashes the machine at full power, causing the water to shoot up at a tremendous pace and trap Team Rocket in a huge waterspout. \n\nOn the outside, Ash and his friends attack the tornado with all of their Pokémon. The wild Pokémon join in with Hyper Beams from Ursaring and Houndoom, Flamethrowers from Houndour and Swift attacks courtesy of the Aipom. However, these attacks inflict nothing on the waterspout. Suddenly, Nelson\'s sensors activate, and a colossal Flamethrower comes from the mountains, stopping the typhoon and sending Team Rocket flying. The Rocket trio lands in front of Entei, who is not sympathetic and unleashes another Flamethrower to send the trio blasting off.\n\nNelson leads the way to Entei\'s position, challenging it to a battle. He has Misdreavus use Mean Look to lock Entei\'s position, and then unleashes Swift and Psybeam. Entei shakes off both attacks and as Misdreavus goes in for a Headbutt, it unleashes a {{m|Roar}}, sending Misdreavus back into its Ball and allowing itself to escape, unhindered by the effects of Mean Look. Nelson sinks to the ground, not having expected such a rebutting tactic. However, he claims that his desire has only increased and that he is determined to capture it one day. The trio then leaves Nelson and continues onto Mt. Silver, with Larvitar having grown accustomed to the company of others, with the exception of Misty.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:Brock Forretress evolution.png|thumb|220px|Brock\'s Pineco evolving]]\n* [[Ash\'s Phanpy]] is revealed to know {{m|Defense Curl}}.\n* [[Brock\'s Onix]] is revealed to know {{m|Sandstorm}}.\n* {{an|Brock}}\'s {{p|Pineco}} [[Evolution|evolves]] into a {{TP|Brock|Forretress}}.\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} see an {{p|Entei}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Forretress}} ({{OP|Brock|Forretress}})\n\n=====TV episode debuts=====\n* {{p|Misdreavus}}\n* {{p|Entei}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n[[File:PMTV EP259.png|thumb|200px|{{tt|Pocket Monster TV|Who\'s That Pokémon}}]]\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Nelson]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP EP259.png|thumb|200px|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Tyrogue}} \'\'(US and international)\'\', {{p|Entei}} \'\'(Japan)\'\'\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Togepi}} ({{OP|Misty|Togepi}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Bayleef}} ({{OP|Ash|Bayleef}})\n* {{p|Cyndaquil}} ({{OP|Ash|Cyndaquil}})\n* {{p|Totodile}} ({{OP|Ash|Totodile}})\n* {{p|Noctowl}} ({{OP|Ash|Noctowl}}; {{Shiny}})\n* {{p|Phanpy}} ({{OP|Ash|Phanpy}})\n* {{p|Goldeen}} ({{OP|Misty|Goldeen}})\n* {{p|Staryu}} ({{OP|Misty|Staryu}})\n* {{p|Psyduck}} ({{OP|Misty|Psyduck}})\n* {{p|Politoed}} ({{OP|Misty|Politoed}})\n* {{p|Corsola}} ({{OP|Misty|Corsola}})\n* {{p|Onix}} ({{OP|Brock|Onix}})\n* {{p|Geodude}} ({{OP|Brock|Geodude}}) \n* {{p|Crobat}} ({{OP|Brock|Crobat}})\n* {{p|Pineco}} ({{OP|Brock|Pineco}}; evolves)\n* {{p|Forretress}} ({{OP|Brock|Forretress}}; newly evolved; debut)\n* {{p|Misdreavus}} ([[Nelson]]\'s)\n* {{p|Larvitar}} ([[Ash\'s Larvitar|anime]])\n* {{p|Ursaring}}\n* {{p|Houndour}} (×2)\n* {{p|Houndoom}} (×2)\n* {{p|Girafarig}}\n* {{p|Swinub}} (×2)\n* {{p|Piloswine}}\n* {{p|Aipom}} (×4)\n* {{p|Entei}}\n* {{p|Miltank}} (picture)\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:EP259 Error.png|thumb|200px|right|The error with Brock leaning on something]]\n* The dub title is derived from the warning phrase "enter at your own risk".\n* When Team Rocket make off with the dairy truck, Ash, and his Pokémon, Meowth says, "We blinded \'em with science!", a reference to the song {{wp|She Blinded Me with Science}} by {{wp|Thomas Dolby}}.\n* This marks the first time a main character\'s Pokémon has evolved in the same episode a [[legendary Pokémon]] has appeared.

Phanpy and Larvitar were also affected despite both of them being {{t|Ground}} types.\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|bg={{tt|Ентей, появи се!|Entei, appear}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|炎帝與溫泉的同伴們！|Entei and Companions of the Hot Spring!}}\n|de={{tt|Das legendäre Entei|The legendary Entei}}\n|nl={{tt|Alle Ogen Gericht op Entei|All Eyes on Entei}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Les sources chaudes|The hot springs}}\n|he=המרדף אחרי אנטיי {{tt|hamirdaf akhrei Entei|The Chase for Entei}}\n|it={{tt|Forti emozioni|Hard emotions}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Entei, eu Quero você!|Entei, I Want you!}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Em Busca do Pokémon mais Querido!|In Search of the most Wanted Pokémon!}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Entei, el Pokémon legendario!|Entei, the legendary Pokémon!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|A Entei no hay quien le venza|No one can defeat Entei}}\n|pl={{tt|Na własne ryzyko, Entei|On your own risk, Entei}}\n|hi=Entei, एक प्राचीन पोकेमोन! {{tt|\'\'Entei, Ek Prachin Pokemon!\'\'|Entei, An Ancient Pokémon!}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP258 |\nprevtitle=Hatch Me If You Can |\nnextcode=EP260 |\nnexttitle=A Crowning Achievement |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Johto | }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0259}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|259]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Shōji Yonemura]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded and directed by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Yūji Asada]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Masaaki Iwane]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Brock]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a main character\'s Pokémon evolves]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a Legendary Pokémon appears]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which an alternately colored Pokémon appears]]\n\n[[de:Das legendäre Entei]]\n[[es:EP261]]\n[[fr:EP259]]\n[[ja:無印編第259話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第260集]]'}
