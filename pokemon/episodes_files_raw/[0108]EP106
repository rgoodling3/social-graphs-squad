It was first broadcast in Japan on July 29, 1999 and in the United States on August 26, 2000. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/03_01-the-pokemon-water-war/-->\n<i>Our heroes try, but are unable to extinguish a dangerous fire, until the local fire brigade—a trained team of Wartortles—arrives and squelches the flames. As a second fire rages, however, Team Rocket abducts the Wartortles, leaving Ash, Misty, Brock, and their Pokémon to somehow save the nearby town from a fiery end.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nArriving at the next port located on [[Ascorbia Island]], {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} are eager to get something to eat. However, their plans are shelved when they approach a warehouse on fire. Defying [[Officer Jenny]]\'s orders, Ash and {{an|Misty}} rush towards the inferno. They send out {{AP|Squirtle}} and {{TP|Misty|Staryu}} to douse the flames, but their efforts are in vain, as the fire begins to spread. Just when some debris begins to fall on the group, a team of {{p|Wartortle}} appear to save them. With a blow of a whistle, they proceed to douse the flames in a coordinated display. Still, Squirtle is not pleased and focuses much of its attention on the lead Wartortle, which wears a yellow bandana around its neck.\n\nLater that day, the team\'s {{pkmn|Trainer}}, [[Captain Aidan]], introduces Ash and his friends to his firefighting force: Teams {{p|Squirtle}}, Wartortle, and {{p|Blastoise}}. Team Blastoise is used for large-scale fires, Team Squirtle for tight-space rescues, while [[Team Wartortle]] is used in more general-purpose scenarios. Ash notices Squirtle\'s discontent, and is even more shocked when it puts on its signature black shades. {{Tracey}} is initially confused, but Ash details Squirtle\'s past as part of the troublesome [[Squirtle Squad]]. Ash quickly notices Squirtle\'s attention to the proceedings, and quickly realizes that its firefighting confidence had been shot when Squirtle itself had to be rescued. Ash begs Captain Aidan to have Squirtle join Team Wartortle for a day of training, which Captain Aidan reluctantly accepts.\n\nSquirtle proves to be every bit as capable as the head of Team Wartortle. In a running exercise, the two are able to outpace the rest of the team. Even though Squirtle had tripped over a pebble and rolled its way to the finish, it set a new land speed record for a Turtle Pokémon. In a shooting exercise, Squirtle and Wartortle are able to shoot down moving targets with equal precision. However, one rogue target leads the team astray from Captain Aidan, and the team soon finds themselves falling into {{TRT}}\'s pitfall trap. Team Rocket emerges from the crater in their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|Meowth Balloon]] with Team Wartortle and Ash\'s Squirtle ensnared in a net. They perform their {{motto}}, and with a pair of mechanical hands, {{MTR}} snatches {{AP|Pikachu}} as well. {{TP|James|Weezing}} uses {{m|Smokescreen}}, allowing Team Rocket to escape. Tracey sends out his {{TP|Tracey|Scyther}} to clear the air, leaving the Pokemon exhausted.\n\nLater, Team Rocket lands at a log cabin, using Pikachu\'s electricity to power a fan while the trio admires their loot. [[Jessie]] and [[James]] then begin arguing over who should keep one of the Wartortle, while Meowth tries to bribe the Turtle Pokemon with food. Jessie interrupts, but Meowth {{m|scratch}}es his teammates\' faces. Unbeknownst to them, Squirtle comes up with a plan and discusses it with Wartortle.\n\nWhile busy looking for Team Rocket, Captain Aidan receives a call alerting him to an apartment fire. Jenny explains that an overturned truck has delayed Team Blastoise, and while Team Squirtle is on the scene, they are easily overwhelmed. At a loss and without Team Wartortle, Misty offers Staryu as a stopgap measure, and Tracey sends out {{TP|Tracey|Marill}} and Scyther to help out. Meanwhile, {{TP|Tracey|Venonat}} continues to search for the missing {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} and soon spots the Meowth Balloon.\n\nInside, Team Rocket is still fighting amongst themselves when Squirtle and Team Wartortle flood Team Rocket\'s cabin with water, with the pressure bursting the doors open. While Team Rocket is washed out of the building, Squirtle and Wartortle remain trapped in their nets, but manage to bunny-hop over each other to slowly inch their way out of the cabin. Now outside, they lure Mewoth into having him scratch them free from their net, as they {{m|withdraw}} into their shells to avoid getting hurt. Just then, Ash and Captain Aidan arrive on the scene, and Venonat {{m|Tackle}}s Team Rocket out of the way. In a last-ditch effort to claim Squirtle and Team Wartortle, Team Rocket sends out {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}} and Weezing. However, they are propelled backwards by {{m|Water Gun}}, and Pikachu\'s {{m|Thunderbolt}} sends Team Rocket flying.\n\nAt the apartment fire, Misty and Scyther become worn out; while Staryu, Marill, and Team Squirtle are unable to contain the fire. However, Squirtle and Team Wartortle arrive in time, just as a child is revealed to be trapped in the building. Squirtle puts on its black shades and is eager to meet the challenge. It and the head Wartortle, with help from a Blastoise, are propelled into the fiery building. They soon reach the child, and Wartortle has the boy cling onto its back. Unexpectedly, the floor crumbles under Wartortle\'s weight, but Squirtle manages to pull it and the child back to safety. Wartortle then notices a falling door, and uses Water Gun to save Squirtle from injury. Wartortle and Squirtle emerge with the boy in hand, leaping over a wall of fire in the process. Team Wartortle, Squirtle, and Blastoise\'s efforts eventually manage to put out the fire. The young boy is reunited with his mother, who then thanks Captain Aidan for his efforts. Ash urges the woman to thank the Pokemon as his Squirtle and the lead Wartortle shake hands. In the end, Ash and his friends part ways with Captain Aidan, but not without performing a final salute.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

However, the [[S02|Pokémon: Adventures on the Orange Islands]] title remains for this and the remaining ten episodes of the [[Orange Archipelago|Orange Islands]] saga.\n** On DVD releases, the title of season premiere is given to \'\'[[EP117|Don\'t Touch That \'dile]]\'\'.\n* When this episode first aired in the United States, the Japanese version of [[Meowth\'s Party]] plays. However, in reruns, home video releases and streaming releases, it is replaced with [[Pikachu\'s Jukebox]].\n* The voices of [[Who\'s That Pokémon?]] changed again and remained this way until \'\'[[AG040|Watt\'s with Wattson]]\'\'.\n* Instead of saying "{{wp|Eeny, meeny, miny, moe}}", [[Jessie]] says, "{{p|Eevee}}, {{p|Mankey}}, {{p|Hitmonlee}}."\n\n===Errors===\n* When {{Ash}} recalls {{AP|Lapras}} at the beginning of the episode, his gloves are missing. The same happened with [[Officer Jenny]] when {{p|Squirtle}} and {{TP|Misty|Staryu}} were trying to stop the fire.\n* When Team Wartortle lined up to put out the first fire, the leader of the team is missing its signature yellow bandana.\n* In the scene of the final fire, {{Tracey}} is holding {{TP|Misty|Togepi}}. However, Togepi\'s face is missing, although it may just be hiding, and Tracey\'s arm is painted the same color as his shirt.\n* In one scene where {{an|Misty}} is seen trying to put out the fire with her Staryu and [[Tracey\'s Marill]] and {{TP|Tracey|Scyther}}, Ash and Tracey are seen next to her. In the next scene, they are shown running to meet up with her.\n* The Pokemon.com blurb mentions {{an|Brock}} instead of Tracey, even though Brock isn\'t a part of the group at that time. Also, Wartortle is spelled with an s.\n\n<gallery>\nEP106 error.png|Togepi\'s missing face and Tracey\'s green arm\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[Pikachu\'s Jukebox]]: {{so|Viridian City}}\n* The scene in the log cabin with {{TRT}} fighting over who gets to pick a Wartortle first was slightly edited for the dub. During that scene, {{MTR}} scratches Jessie and [[James]]\'s faces and they have a brawl. In the original Japanese version, Meowth is actually seen to be violently scratching Jessie and James\'s faces with an almost perfect and fluid scratching animation, with the resulting bloody scratch marks on their faces. In the English dub, the scratching shot was cut, and was replaced with two shots of colored stars with a black background, as it was very violent for this type of show.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FFDDAA|bordercolor=FFBB55\n|bg={{tt|Покемон – водна битка|}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|滅火大賽，傑尼龜對抗卡咪龜|Firefighting Showdown, Squirtle vs Wartortle}}\n|cs={{tt|Vodní dobrodružství|The water adventure}}\n|nl={{tt|Het Pokémon Watergevecht|The Pokémon Water Fight}}\n|de={{tt|Wasser Marsch!|Charge the hose line}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|La guerre aquatique Pokémon|The Pokémon Water War}}\n|he=מלחמת המים {{tt|\'\'Milkhemet ha\'mayim\'\'|The water war}}\n|hu={{tt|A vízi csata|The Water Battle}}\n|hi=वाटर गन की जंग! {{tt|\'\'Water Gun ki Jung\'\'|War of the Water Guns}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n|ta=தி போகிமொன் வாட்டர் வார் {{tt|\'\'The Pokémon Water War\'\'|Same as English}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n|te=ది పోకెమోన్ వాటర్ వార్ {{tt|\'\'The Pokémon Water War\'\'|Same as English}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n|it={{tt|Brigate antincendio|Fire brigades}}{{tt|*|Original 2000 dub}} <br> {{tt|La battaglia d\'acqua Pokémon|The Pokémon water battle}}{{tt|*|2014 K2 TV dub}}\n|pt_br={{tt|A Guerra de Água Pokémon|The Pokémon Water War}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|A Guerra dos Pokémon de Água|The Water Pokémon War}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡La guerra de agua Pokémon!|The Pokémon water war!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|La guerra de los Pokémon de agua|The water Pokémon war}}\n|pl={{tt|Wodna wojna pokémonów|The Pokémon water war}}\n|ro={{tt|Războiul Pokémonilor de Apă|The War of the Water Pokémon}}\n}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP105 |\nprevtitle=Charizard Chills |\nnextcode=EP107 |\nnexttitle=Pokémon Food Fight! |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Orange}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0106}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|106]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Shinzō Fujita]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Yoshitaka Fujimoto]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Toshiaki Suzuki]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Izumi Shimura]]\n\n[[de:Wasser marsch!]]\n[[es:EP108]]\n[[fr:EP106]]\n[[it:EP106]]\n[[ja:無印編第106話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第107集]]'}
