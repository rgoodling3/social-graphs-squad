(Japanese: '''ドクター・モロボシの島！化石ポケモン現る！！''' ''Island of {{tt|Dr. Moroboshi|Professor Proctor}}! Fossil Pokémon Appear!!'') is the 102nd episode of the {{series|Advanced Generation}}, and the 376th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on November 11, 2004 and in the United States on November 19, 2005.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/08_10-wheres-armaldo/-->\n<i>The kids travel to Wales Island, where both Ash and May have plans to train. May is thrilled when her Bulbasaur learns a new attack—Petal Dance. She shows it off to the others by having Bulbasaur blast through an ocean wave.\n\nMax is gathering twigs in the forest when he is surprised by a Cradily. He tells the others but they don't believe him, because Cradily are extinct. Max goes searching by himself, and eventually finds a lab full of Lileep.\n\nAsh and the others eventually run into the Cradily, along with a scientist named Annie. She takes them back to the lab, where they are reunited with Max. There, Professor Proctor and Annie explain to the kids that all of the Pokémon there were cloned from fossils. Someday Professor Proctor hopes to make the island a fossil Pokémon amusement park.\n\nOne of the Anorith at the lab is about to evolve, so they bring it out and watch it become an Armaldo. Team Rocket shows up, and grabs the newly evolved Armaldo in a net. It blasts them away on its own, but freaks out and starts trashing the lab, running off.\n\nThe kids try to corral it with their Pokémon, but Armaldo won't be beaten. It heads to the tip of the island to find some fruit that it can eat. There, Team Rocket appears in a giant tank and grabs it again. It can't break out, and none of the other Pokémon's attacks affect the tank. May has her Bulbasaur use Petal Dance on the cliff above the tank which landslides, causing the tank to roll over. Armaldo breaks out, and Bulbasaur and Pikachu destroy the tank, sending Team Rocket blasting away. Armaldo finally reaches the berries, while everyone enjoys the sunset.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} stop at [[Wales Island]], a nature preserve said to have not changed in over a millennia. While Ash has {{AP|Pikachu}} practice some of his attacks on some driftwood, {{an|May}} happily exclaims that her {{TP|May|Bulbasaur}} has finally learned {{m|Petal Dance}}. Sure enough, Bulbasaur is able to use the [[move]] to slice a hole through an incoming wave.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Max]] is out by himself gathering firewood in the forest when he spots a {{p|Cradily}}. Max screams and the Pokémon runs off. Hearing the scream, the others come running and Max explains what he saw. {{an|Brock}} has his doubts, adding that Cradily are supposed to be extinct. As Ash looks for the Pokémon, May suggests that maybe he mistook it for another Pokémon. Suddenly, a {{p|Breloom}} appears, and everyone assumes that this is what Max saw. Max insists that he really saw a Cradily and runs off, anxious to prove them wrong. As he explores the forest, Max comes across a mansion with what appears to be a laboratory inside. Through the window, he's also able to see that there are many {{p|Lileep}} inside, which are the [[Evolution|pre-evolved]] form of Cradily. Suddenly Max is caught by a man in a lab coat. As Ash and the others search for Max, a {{p|Cradily}} appears behind them. A woman in a lab coat quickly follows it, and Brock falls madly in love. The woman introduces herself as [[Annie Proctor]], to which the trio explain that Max has wondered off. Annie thinks Max probably ended up at the laboratory, so she escorts them there.\n\nAnnie and the others soon arrive at the laboratory, where Max is waiting with [[Professor Proctor]], Annie's husband. Brock is crushed to find out Annie is married. There they see the Lileep, and May wonders how they could be there since they're supposed to be extinct. Annie and Professor Proctor explain that the Pokémon were [[Cloning|cloned]] from [[Root Fossil|Root}} and [[Claw Fossil]]s, and the gang are eager to learn more. Outside, {{TRT}} spy on everyone and listen in. Using a computer simulation, Professor Proctor explains that Wales Island was once connected to the mainland, though became an isolated location because of rising waters. The resident ancient Pokémon, like Lileep, Cradily, {{p|Anorith}}, and {{p|Armaldo}} lived on a peninsula, became extinct as a result of the geographic isolation. Professor Proctor admits that he hopes to make Wales Island an amusement park inhabited exclusively by his resurrected Fossil Pokémon. Annie tells the kids to remain quiet about the news as they are yet to officially announce their discoveries to the scientific world. Outside, [[Jessie]], [[James]], and {{MTR}} begin plotting to steal the Pokémon.\n\nBack in the lab, Annie exclaims that an Anorith is ready to evolve, so the group gathers to watch. After its successful [[evolution]] into an {{p|Armaldo}}, a net appears and grabs Armaldo. Team Rocket begin to gleefully reel in their catch, but Armaldo uses {{m|Metal Claw}} to break free of the net and uses {{m|Water Gun}} on Team Rocket, sending them blasting off. Unfortunately Armaldo is enraged and turns its Water Gun on Ash and the rest of the lab before storming outside.\n\nAsh and the others begin to give chase into the forest, confused as to why Armaldo turned on them. They soon find Armaldo chewing on some fruit, unable to find any it likes. When they try to convince it to come back to the lab, it launches another Water Gun, which everyone is able to dodge. Pikachu tries to explain things to Armaldo, and the group decide that maybe having Pokémon of the same type talk to it would help. So since May's {{TP|May|Beautifly}} and Brock's {{TP|Brock|Forretress}} share Armaldo's {{type|Bug}} traits, they are sent out to talk. The talks fail, however, when Armaldo uses a {{m|Metal Claw}} attack on the Pokémon, though they manage to evade. Ash decides to try battling it, and he calls on his {{AP|Corphish}} to use {{m|Crabhammer}} on Armaldo. Armaldo merely swats Corphish away. Corphish recovers and uses {{m|Bubble Beam}}, but Armaldo counters it with a Water Gun attack and knocks Corphish out. As Ash tends to Corphish, Armaldo uses Metal Claw to burrow into the ground and escape.\n\nAs May wonders if Armaldo is looking for something, Professor Proctor theorizes that it is looking for the fruit the species ate centuries ago. Today, the [[Berry|Berries]] only exist at the very tip of the crescent-shaped island. Sure enough they find Armaldo there, but it's grabbed by a [[Team Rocket's mechas|tank mecha]]. After Team Rocket recites their {{motto}}, they make their way towards the laboratory to steal the other fossil Pokémon. Professor Proctor gives chase until he's close enough to jump on the back. Once on the mecha, the Professor pounds on the mecha to let Armaldo know that he's there, and Armaldo recognizes that he's there to help. James notices that Professor Proctor is on the mecha, and swerves in attempt to fling him off. He manages to cling on, so James has the mecha's arms grab the Professor and toss him off it. Proctor lands with a thud in front of Ash and the others, who are trying their best to keep up. \n\nAsh has Pikachu use {{m|Thunderbolt}}, but the attack is useless against the mecha's iron-clad armor. May then calls on her Bulbasaur to use Petal Dance, while the move fails to damage the tank, it causes an avalanche of rocks to fall down, blocking the road. Team Rocket tries to change directions, but end up flipping onto their roof. Max notices that the bottom of the mecha is ordinary metal, so attacks can probably get through it. At this, Professor Proctor pounds on the mecha to tell Armaldo where the weak spot is, and it uses Metal Claw to break free. Team Rocket refuse to give up, with Meowth jumping forward to use {{m|Fury Swipes}} on Armaldo. Armaldo counters with {{m|Rock Blast}} and bends Meowth's claws. Bulbasaur then steps in and uses Petal Dance, followed by Pikachu with a {{m|Thunder}} attack, sending Team Rocket blasting off again. \n\nWith Armaldo safe, the Pokémon finds its favorite Berries and eats happily, thankful for the rescue and much more friendly now. Also, since Bulbasaur did so well in battle, May decides to use it in her next [[Pokémon Contest]]. Before resuming their journey, Ash and his enjoy the beautiful sunset with Professor Proctor, Annie, and Armaldo.\n\n==Major events==\n* [[May's Bulbasaur]] learns {{m|Petal Dance}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Cradily}}\n* {{p|Lileep}}\n* {{p|Anorith}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{an|Giovanni}} ([[Boss fantasy|fantasy]])\n* [[Professor Proctor]]\n* [[Annie Proctor]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:PTC AG102.png|thumb|200px|right|Pokémon Trainer's Choice]]\n[[Pokémon Trainer's Choice]]: {{p|Squirtle}}\n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Chimecho}} ({{OP|James|Chimecho}})\n* {{p|Corphish}} ({{OP|Ash|Corphish}})\n* {{p|Beautifly}} ({{OP|May|Beautifly}})\n* {{p|Bulbasaur}} ({{OP|May|Bulbasaur}})\n* {{p|Forretress}} ({{OP|Brock|Forretress}})\n* {{p|Lileep}} (multiple; debut)\n* {{p|Cradily}} (debut)\n* {{p|Anorith}} (evolves; debut)\n* {{p|Armaldo}} (newly evolved)\n* {{p|Breloom}}\n* {{p|Kabuto}} (fantasy)\n* {{p|Omastar}} (fantasy)\n* {{p|Aerodactyl}} (fantasy; ×2)\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[Advance Adventure]] is used as background music.\n* The title is a pun on ''Where's Waldo?'', the North American name of the children's book series ''{{wp|Where's Wally?}}''.\n* The plot of the episode is similar in some aspects to ''{{wp|Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park}}''.\n* This episode marks the only time when [[May's Bulbasaur]] learns a move that isn't also known by [[Ash's Bulbasaur]].\n* {{TRT}} uses a modified version of their original motto theme music.\n* The Japanese title for the episode could be a reference to ''{{wp|The Island of Doctor Moreau}}''.\n\n===Errors===\n\n===Dub edits===\n====[[Pokémon Trainer's Choice]]====\n* Question: Trainers, which Pokémon was {{tt|my|Ash's}} original choice as a starter?\n* Choices: {{p|Squirtle}}, {{p|Bulbasaur}}, {{p|Charmander}}\n* Answer: OK, Trainers!
