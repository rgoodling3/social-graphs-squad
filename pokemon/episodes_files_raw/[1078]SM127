It first aired in Japan on June 23, 2019 and in the United States on October 26, 2019.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/22_35-chasing-memories-creating-dreams/-->\n<i>Professor Kukui has finally realized his dream of establishing the Alola Pokémon League, and he’s excited to welcome everyone to the dedication of the brand-new Manalo Stadium. Much to the excitement of our heroes, he announces that the Champion of the Alola Pokémon League will be granted an exhibition battle with the Masked Royal. Ash and friends are fired up and eager to participate—and Lillie even pulls off her first Z-Move!\n\nMeanwhile, Gladion sets out on a search…and eventually reunites with his father’s long-lost Zoroark! After learning that its partner is still alive, Zoroark agrees to join Gladion on his quest to find Professor Mohn!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAt the [[Poni Breaker Coast]], {{an|Gladion}} is challenging [[Hapu]] in a bid to win her [[Island challenge|grand trial]]. Hapu orders {{p|Golurk}} to use {{m|Flash Cannon}}, but Gladion\'s [[Z-Ring]] charges up first and {{TP|Gladion|Lycanroc}} uses {{m|Devastating Drake}}. The two attacks collide, resulting in Golurk\'s defeat. Hapu [[recall]]s Golurk and congratulates Gladion on his victory. He affirms that it was the final grand trial he needed to win. Hapu asks about his next step and Gladion admits there is one more thing he has to do before the [[Manalo Conference]].\n\nAt {{an|Lillie}}\'s manor, [[Snowy]] stares at the inactive {{p|Magearna}} while Lillie continues to examine [[Mohn|her father]]\'s journals for clues. She learns his theories about Magearna\'s Soul-Heart being both its soul and its source of power. Just then, [[Hobbes]] announces that her friends have arrived. Lillie explains that she and the girls are going to practice their [[Z-Move]]s in the backyard, though Hobbes informs her that {{Ash}} and the other boys have also come over. Lillie arrives at a living room to greet her friends, and {{an|Lana}} admits that she invited the boys along for support. They are all keen to get started on training, but Lillie replies that she would like them all to meet a Pokémon first. She guides them to the hidden study room, introduces them to Magearna, and explains that it was a gift she received from her father when she very young, though it has never moved. {{Rotom}} then draws everyone\'s attention over to Mohn\'s journal. Lillie declares that she has two goals to achieve before her father\'s return: to master a Z-Move and to reawaken Magearna.\n\nMeanwhile, {{an|Professor Kukui}} gazes at the newly completed [[Manalo Stadium]] and is pleased to see his childhood dream finally being realized. The [[Team Rocket trio]] is nearby, selling honey doughnuts to the gathering crowd. Later, {{an|Lusamine}}, [[Professor Burnet]], [[Wicke]], and {{an|Faba}} hop off their helicopter and reach the Manalo Stadium island.\n\nGladion and his {{TP|Gladion|Umbreon}} scour the [[Poni Island]] wilderness in search of Mohn\'s missing {{p|Zoroark}}, hoping to fulfill a promise he made to his mother. As they search, they feel as if they are being watched, even though they only see harmless Pokémon lingering about. At Lillie\'s place, {{an|Mallow}} attempts to perform a Z-Move with {{TP|Mallow|Tsareena}}, but it fails to even charge. Lana and {{an|Sophocles}} practice, and the pair is impressed when {{TP|Lana|Primarina}} and {{TP|Sophocles|Vikavolt}} use {{m|Sparkling Aria}} and {{m|Zap Cannon}}, respectively. Lillie becomes increasingly nervous, and even Ash\'s advice doesn\'t offer her much insight into performing a successful Z-Move.\n\nThe practice is put on hold when Hobbes calls the children back inside. The group and their Pokémon gather around the [[television]] to watch Kukui officially unveil the Alola League and its home ground, the [[Manalo Stadium]], to the public. Kukui declares that the League will be open to everyone. He also reveals that the crowned Champion will be participating in a special {{wp|exhibition game|exhibition match}} against the Masked Royal afterwards. The thrilling announcement leaves Lana, Ash, and Kiawe particularly excited for the League. In a change of heart, Faba sets his sights on competing in order to battle against his idol. [[James]] also announces his intention to compete.\n\nMeanwhile, Gladion\'s search for Zoroark continues. As he and Umbreon walk along a rocky beach, a {{p|Mandibuzz}} swoops in and uses {{m|Air Slash}}. Umbreon uses {{m|Dark Pulse}} to neutralize the attack, but Mandibuzz enters into a {{m|Brave Bird}}. Gladion calls for a {{m|Shadow Ball}}, which hits its mark and Mandibuzz promptly leaves. Umbreon is prepared to give chase, but Gladion orders it to focus on finding Zoroark. A {{p|Dewgong}} appears in the water and bounds onto the shore before transforming into a {{p|Buneary}}. Umbreon turns back to see if they are being followed, but the Buneary goes undetected as it hides behind a large rock.\n\nMallow’s practice continues to falter as she struggles to raise enough Z-Power to even attack. A sudden frost fills the air, and everyone realizes that it is Lillie surrounded in a light blue light. Lillie concentrates her inner strength as she thinks of her father\'s words. She utters the sacred words and performs the Z-Pose before the Z-Power is successfully passed onto Snowy. Under a shroud of blue light, Snowy unleashes a frosty {{m|Subzero Slammer}}. Lillie is thrilled, having finally succeeded in one of her goals as she hugs Snowy. She turns to Ash, admitting that she finally understands what he meant by the words "fwoosh" and "zap" earlier. Kiawe admits that Lillie is now off her provision Z-Ring license and suggests she inform [[Hala]] of her achievement. Unknowingly, Magearna is beginning to flicker slightly because of Lillie\'s swelling confidence and perfection of her Z-Move.\n\nOvernight and by a bonfire, Gladion and Umbreon are struggling to stay awake. Some snarls disturb the pair, and soon a {{p|Lurantis}} appears before them. It stares intently at Gladion, who orders Umbreon to fire a Dark Pulse at it. The attack causes Lurantis to reveals its true forme to actually be Mohn\'s long-lost Zoroark. Gladion steps forward to greet it, but Zoroark first shows him an {{a|illusion}} of Mohn and toddler Gladion helping Lusamine to comfort a crying baby Lillie. The touching family moment only affirms Zoroark\'s affections for Gladion and his family. Gladion reaches out his hand and pets Zoroark\'s cheek before nuzzling into its shoulder. Umbreon soon joins in, brushing itself up against Zoroark. Gladion informs Zoroark that Mohn is alive and requests its help with finding him. Zoroark promptly kneels down and bows its head to indicate that it wishes to assist.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
