I Choose You!!\'\') is the 105th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on July 22, 1999 and in the United States on September 2, 2000.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/02_49-charizard-chills/-->\n<i>Ash, Tracey and Misty are sailing along on Lapras when they almost crash into another Pokémon trainer wanting to battle Ash. This trainer heard about Ash from the Trovita Island gym leader and wants to put his Pokémon up against Ash\'s. When the new trainer uses a super-powerful Poliwrath on Charizard, it\'s more than anyone expects. Charizard finally decides to obey and respect Ash as not only his trainer but also his friend, and the two become closer than ever!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}}, {{an|Misty}}, and {{Tracey}} encounter a large ship that nearly hits them while riding {{AP|Lapras}}. The ship\'s captain checks on them for any injuries, and then introduces himself as [[Tad]]. He quickly recognizes Ash from the [[Trovita Gym]].\n\nAboard the boat, Tad explains that he is trying to get into the "[[Pokémon League]]". He states that he battled [[Rudy]] after Ash did, and overheard Rudy commend Ash for using pure power to win. After Misty comments that Ash does not have any skill, Tad challenges Ash to a {{pkmn|battle}}, claiming that he likes to challenge people who know what to do. Misty, however, jokes about this by pretending not to see Ash while Tad describes him. They then set a course toward [[Cleopatra Island]], which they presume to be deserted. However, {{TRT}} is already on the island, doing some repairs to one of their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|machines]]. {{MTR}} spots Ash and {{ashfr}} approaching the island through his binoculars, he then alerts [[Jessie]] and [[James]], who hope to steal {{AP|Pikachu}}.\n\nAfter the group reaches Cleopatra Island, the battle begins. Ash selects Pikachu for the match, while Tad chooses his {{p|Poliwrath}}, which is wearing the golden championship belt that it won from Tad\'s hometown for being the most powerful Pokémon there. Misty is puzzled by the choice, given that Poliwrath has the [[type]] disadvantage. Tracey urges Ash to watch out for any tricks, but Ash is nonetheless confident. He orders Pikachu to use {{m|Thunderbolt}}, but Poliwrath immediately uses {{m|Double Team}} to evade the attack and surround Pikachu. At Ash\'s command, Pikachu then uses {{m|Quick Attack}} to get rid of the illusory Poliwrath. Pikachu finds the real Poliwrath and uses his tail to shock it, but his opponent is unfazed by the {{t|Electric}} attack. Poliwrath quickly uses {{m|Hypnosis}}, followed by {{m|Water Gun}} to defeat Pikachu. Tracey explains that Tad let Pikachu use his energy up so that when Poliwrath used its own power, it could easily defeat Pikachu. Tad admits that there is more to battling than type match-ups and that he likes to use the element of surprise.\n\nAsh, unfazed by Pikachu\'s defeat, tries to match power with power and calls out {{AP|Charizard}}, much to the horror of Misty and Tracey. Ash comments that he can handle Charizard, just as it burns him with {{m|Flamethrower}}. Tad notices this and asks Ash if he is sure about the choice. Ash says he is, just as Charizard flies off on its own. Tad recognizes Charizard\'s power, but states that Ash will never get into the [[Orange League]] with a disobedient Pokémon. At Tad\'s request, Poliwrath launches a Water Gun at Charizard, which instantly calls the Pokémon back to the beach. As Ash urges his Pokémon to work with him, Charizard knocks him to the ground and attempts to hit him with its tail. Charizard continues to ignore Ash, it then flies into the air and attempts to hit Poliwrath with Flamethrower. The two opponents exchange several Water Gun and Flamethrower attacks. The match comes to an abrupt end when Poliwrath unleashes a powerful {{m|Ice Beam}}, which {{status|freeze}}s Charizard, except for its flaming tail. Charizard plummets to the sand, and Ash desperately tries to free his Pokémon from the ice with a rock. Tad recalls Poliwrath but promises Ash a rematch once he learns how to handle Charizard. He leaves with Charizard freezing and Ash seething from the defeat. Perched on the sea cliffs, Team Rocket watches the match and sees Ash\'s defeat as their next opportunity to snatch Pikachu.\n\nLater that night, Ash has set up a burning fire to assist Charizard\'s recovery and then rubs its hide. Charizard eventually wakes up and begins to thrash around in panic just as Misty and Tracey return with some firewood. Charizard tries to launch a Flamethrower at Ash, but faints once again. Misty puts a blanket over Charizard\'s body as she and Ash continue to rub Charizard\'s back. Tracey checks its temperature and notes Charizard is still cold, so he decides to fetch more wood for the fire. Ash\'s efforts seem to be paying off, as Charizard wakes up again and its tail flame begins to burn more. As Ash continues to massage Charizard, he admits that he is not the best {{pkmn|Trainer}}. He then asserts that he is always trying to get better and hopes that one day the two will battle side by side. Charizard secretly listens to Ash\'s words and reminisces about its time with Ash.\n\nIn the morning, Charizard wakes up the group, and they realize it has fully recovered. However, Team Rocket strikes, and they trap Pikachu inside their giant, shockproof drill machine with an explosion. Tad also notices the dust and rejoins the group, just as Team Rocket says their {{motto}}. Team Rocket then makes their getaway by digging a tunnel. Just as Ash tries to pursue them, Charizard flies beside him and urges Ash to get on its back. The pair flies into the tunnel after Pikachu, whereupon Charizard uses its feet to grab the machine before it can go deeper, and pulls it back up the hill. Charizard attempts to burn the drill but Ash stops him to prevent him from injuring Pikachu. At Ash\'s request, Charizard crushes the drill with his foot and bites down to destroy the box containing Pikachu.\n\nPikachu is returned to Ash, but Team Rocket is not done yet. Meowth presses a button, and two circular saws attempt to cut Ash, Pikachu, and Charizard. Charizard manages to avoid the blades, but lands on its back, leaving Ash and Pikachu knocked out on the beach. Seeing Ash unconscious, Charizard\'s eyes gleam white and its tail flame grows to enormous proportion. Just as Ash checks his [[Pokédex]] for more details, a swirling fireball emerges in Charizard\'s mouth. To Ash\'s surprise, Charizard has learned {{m|Dragon Rage}}; the attack destroys Team Rocket\'s machine and sends them blasting off once again.\n\nTad, Misty, and Tracey find Ash and his Pokémon, and Tracey realizes that Charizard and Ash are on better terms. With the Flame Pokémon now under control and as promised, Tad challenges Ash to a rematch, which he accepts. Tad sends out Poliwrath and makes the first move, Water Gun. Ash orders Charizard to fly, and the Pokémon complies to evade the attack. Charizard\'s {{m|Ember}} attack is reduced to steam by Poliwrath\'s twirling Water Gun. Ash replies with {{m|Take Down}}. Poliwrath goes in for a {{m|Mega Kick}}, but Charizard catches its opponent\'s foot. Charizard flies into the air and avoids a close-range Ice Beam. Poliwrath attempts a {{m|Body Slam}}, but Charizard swoops in and sends it into the air. Charizard grabs hold of its opponent and performs {{m|Seismic Toss}}, taking Tad by surprise. Poliwrath is knocked out after it hits the ground. In celebration, Charizard lets out a mighty roar and Ash hugs his Pokémon. Tad rushes over to Ash, and the two Trainers exchange a handshake.\n\nThe group waves goodbye to Tad as he leaves the island on his ship. Ash jumps into the air, claiming that nobody will be able to beat him, but he accidentally knocks Charizard off balance while it is scratching itself with its leg. Getting angry, Charizard unleashes a Flamethrower, causing Ash, Misty, and Tracey to flee. Misty and Tracey tell Ash to not to get Charizard angry; he confidently says that he can take the heat.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

This is mainly because Charizard is obeying Ash in the movie.\n* This episode is featured on \'\'Volume 3: Charizard\'\' from [[Viz Media]]\'s {{OBP|Pokémon All-Stars|Region 1}} series.\n* This episode was the last of the [[original series]] aired in {{pmin|Russia}} and in {{wp|Channel One (Russia)|ORT}}.\n* Parts of this episode were reanimated and used for flashback material for \'\'[[BW116|The Fires of a Red-Hot Reunion]]\'\'.\n* The belt that [[Tad]]\'s {{p|Poliwrath}} is wearing greatly resembles to the [[P1 Grand Prix]]\'s belt that [[Ash\'s Primeape]] wears at the end of \'\'[[EP029|The Punchy Pokémon]]\'\'. It is very possible that Tad was born, or lives in the city where the P1 Grand Prix takes place, as he mentions it himself.\n* According to [[Pokémon.com]], this is the season finale of [[S02|Pokémon: Adventures in the Orange Islands]]. However, on DVD releases of the season, that title falls to \'\'[[EP116|The Rivalry Revival]]\'\'.\n** This was also the last second season and [[Orange Archipelago|Orange Islands]] arc episode to air in {{pmin|Denmark}}, {{pmin|Norway}}, Russia, and {{pmin|Sweden}}.\n* Both this episode, in which {{AP|Charizard}} starts obeying {{Ash}} again, and \'\'[[EP044|The Problem with Paras]]\'\', in which Charizard (as {{p|Charmeleon}}) first started to disobey Ash, were written by Atsuhiro Tomioka.\n* The Japanese title may reference the title of [[EP001|the first episode]].\n\n===Errors===\n* In the scene where the group is on Tad\'s ship, there is a coloring error in which {{Tracey}}\'s headband is painted green instead of pink. This shade of green is the same as Tad\'s bandana.\n* After Charizard saves {{AP|Pikachu}}, Ash congratulates it and he has his jacket and hat on, even though he didn\'t have them before Pikachu\'s rescue seconds ago. Also, they are seen disappearing again a few seconds later.\n* In the dub, the [[Pokédex]] incorrectly identifies Charizard\'s {{m|Dragon Rage}} as {{m|Rage}}.\n* When Charizard destroys {{TRT}}\'s drill, Ash is no longer on his back for a few seconds.\n* In this episode, Charizard easily carries Ash on its back. However, later on in \'\'[[EP134|Charizard\'s Burning Ambitions!]]\'\', Ash was too heavy for Charizard to carry.\n\n<gallery>\nEP105 error.png|The headband error\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[Pikachu\'s Jukebox]]: {{so|Viridian City}}\n* This episode was aired before \'\'[[EP103|Misty Meets Her Match!]]\'\' in the United States, causing some confusion on when Ash actually obtained his third Badge or even that Ash\'s Charizard was disobeying him once more after the airing of this episode.\n* This episode was aired between \'\'[[EP098|A Way Off Day Off]]\'\' and \'\'[[EP100|Wherefore Art Thou, Pokémon?]]\'\' on the Hungama TV and Disney XD in {{pmin|South Asia|India}}, skipping \'\'[[EP099|The Mandarin Island Miss Match]]\'\'.\n* {{so|Pokémon World}} replaces Type: Wild in the dub.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FFDDAA|bordercolor=FFBB55\n|zh_cmn={{tt|噴火龍，就決定是你了！|Charizard, I Choose You!}}\n|cs={{tt|Zamražený Charizard|Frozen Charizard}}\n|da={{tt|Charizard går kold|Charizard goes cold}}\n|nl={{tt|Een IJskoude Charizard|An Ice Cold Charizard}}\n|de={{tt|Willkommen im Dream Team|Welcome to the dream team}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Tout feu tout flamme|Any fire any flame}}\n|he=צ\'אריזרד מתקרר {{tt|\'\'Charizard mitkarer\'\'|Charizard cools down}}\n|hi=Charizard बना मेरा दोस्त! {{tt|\'\'Charizard bana mera dost!\'\'|Charizard became my friend!}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n|hu={{tt|Charizard fázik|Charizard is Freezing}}\n|it={{tt|Un nuovo sfidante|A new challenger}}\n|no={{tt|Kalde, varme Charizard|Cold, hot Charizard}}\n|pl={{tt|Wzgórza Charizardów|Charizard hills}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Fica Frio, Charizard|Chill Out, Charizard}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|O Charizard Arrefece|Charizard Chills}}\n|ro={{tt|Charizard se Liniștește|Charizard Calms Down}}\n|ru={{tt|Чаризард замерзает!|Charizard Chills!}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Charizard se enfría!|Charizard cools!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Charizard congelado|Frozen Charizard}}\n|sv={{tt|Charizard är iskall|Charizard is ice cold}}\n|tr={{tt|Charizard sakinleşiyor|Charizard calms down}}\n}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP104 |\nprevtitle=Bound For Trouble |\nnextcode=EP106 |\nnexttitle=The Pokémon Water War |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Orange}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0105}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|105]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Atsuhiro Tomioka]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Kazu Yokota]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Shigeru Ōmachi]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Yūsaku Takeda]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Ash]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a main character\'s Pokémon learns a new move]]\n\n[[de:Willkommen im Dream Team!]]\n[[es:EP107]]\n[[fr:EP105]]\n[[it:EP105]]\n[[ja:無印編第105話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第106集]]'}
