It first aired in Japan on April 16, 2009 and in the United States on September 5, 2009.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/12_18-old-rivals-new-tricks/-->\n<i>Dawn plans to use some new Pokémon Ping-Pong tricks in the Sandalstraw Contest, where she hopes to earn her fifth ribbon. Of course, her friend Kenny wants to win and tie Dawn at four ribbons each! As Dawn and Ambipom practice for the Contest, Dawn\'s Mamoswine sits on the sidelines and pretends to be bored—but it can\'t resist interfering with the practice session. Dawn\'s not upset; she knows Mamoswine just wants to be in the Contest. But this Contest is Ambipom\'s time to shine. As the appeals round begins, Jessie (disguised as "Jessilina") shows off Mime Jr.\'s Teeter Dance, and Kenny has his Machoke work its muscles. Then Dawn\'s Ambipom uses its double tails to execute ping-pong moves, earning Dawn a place in the second round with Jessie and Kenny.\n\nAs Dawn waits for the second round to start, Kenny comes over to continue their friendly rivalry. He wants to battle Dawn in the final round, and neither Coordinator plans to lose this one! Sure enough, Dawn and Ambipom manage to defeat Jessie and Seviper in the semifinal battle, which means Kenny is Dawn\'s final opponent. Over in the spectator seats, Ash\'s rival Barry is excited to see his first Contest, and Mamoswine is glued to the action too—but it still pretends it\'s too cool to care!\n\nThe final round match pits Dawn\'s Ambipom against Kenny\'s Prinplup. When Prinplup fires off a Bubble Beam attack, Ambipom uses Focus Punch to hit the Bubble Beam right back. Kenny knew Dawn planned something like this, so he orders Prinplup to return the volley using Metal Claw. The two Pokémon hit the bubbles back and forth, just like Pokémon Ping-Pong! It\'s a well-played battle, but Prinplup goes on the offensive and uses Drill Peck to knock out Ambipom. Now Kenny can get his fourth ribbon, and Barry gets an idea: why doesn\'t Dawn enter the upcoming Pokémon Ping-Pong Tournament? Ambipom likes the idea, so it\'s settled: the tournament will be their next event!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}}, {{AP|Pikachu}}, {{an|Barry}}, his {{TP|Barry|Empoleon}}, and [[Dawn\'s Ambipom]] are exercising and practicing for the upcoming [[Pokémon Ping Pong Tournament]] while {{an|Brock}}, {{an|Dawn}}, and {{TP|Dawn|Piplup}} watch. {{si|Kenny}} comes up to them and tells Dawn that she should be focusing on the [[Sandalstraw Town]] [[Pokémon Contest]] for her fifth [[Ribbon]]. She tells him that she was just putting the finishing touches on their moves and says that she\'s entering Ambipom for both rounds which surprises Kenny. Dawn explains to Kenny that she thought Ambipom would be a good choice as she has experience in both [[Appeal|performances]] and [[Contest Battle]]s. She also mentions that she got Ambipom in a [[trade]] with Ash and that she wants to win for him as well. [[Jessie]] (or rather Jessilina) is also entering the Sandalstraw Contest to try to win her third Ribbon, and has decided to take a cue from [[Ursula]] and the way she used her Pokémon\'s ability to store energy during the {{to|Chocovine}} Contest. [[James]] agrees to let her use his {{TP|James|Mime Jr.}} for the appeals.\n\nDawn starts some last-minute practice with Kenny while Ash and Pikachu practice Pokémon Ping Pong with Barry and Empoleon. {{TP|Dawn|Mamoswine}} shows some interest, despite trying to hide it from Dawn. After the practice begins, an {{m|Ice Shard}} is launched at them which Ambipom smashes with {{m|Double Hit}}. Dawn asks Mamoswine if it was responsible for that Ice Shard and asks if Mamoswine wants to compete in the Pokémon Contest too, but Mamoswine attempts to go back to sleep. Dawn and Ambipom get back to practicing and Mamoswine sends another Ice Shard their way. Dawn says she\'s sure Mamoswine wants to compete but Mamoswine still refuses to show real interest which makes Piplup angry. Dawn isn\'t fazed, positive that someday Mamoswine will compete in a Pokémon Contest. Brock thinks that Mamoswine wants some attention and reminds Ash of how Ambipom used to act while she was still an Aipom. Ash has very fond memories of the times they shared and wishes Ambipom the best of luck in the Contest.\n\nThe Sandalstraw Contest is soon underway and [[Marian]] welcomes the {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s and the audience while Ash, Brock, Barry, Pikachu, Piplup, {{TP|Dawn|Buneary}}, {{TP|Dawn|Pachirisu}}, and Mamoswine watch and cheer Dawn on. Barry says that he\'s never been to a real Pokémon Contest before as Marian introduces the [[Contest Judge|panel of judges]], formed by [[Raoul Contesta|Mr. Contesta]] from the [[Pokémon Activities Committee]], [[Mr. Sukizo]] from the [[Pokémon Fan Club]], and the [[Nurse Joy]] from the local [[Pokémon Center]].\n\nJessie disguised as Jessilina is the first entrant and calls Mime Jr. for the [[Appeal|Performance Stage]]. James, {{MTR}}, and {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} cheer her on from the top of the stands in disguises. Jessie tells Mime Jr. to use {{m|Teeter Dance}}, and Mime Jr. sits on the floor in seemingly meditation which confuses the Contest Judges and the audience. However Mime Jr. soon unleashes its stored energy and uses Teeter Dance while on its head. Everyone in the stadium, including Ash, {{ashfr}}, the Pokémon, the audience, Marian and even the judges, is affected by the Teeter Dance and begin dancing. Dawn and Kenny, who aren\'t affected by Teeter Dance as they\'re watching from the waiting area backstage, comment on Jessilina\'s change of style. The judges love Mime Jr.\'s presentation and it appears Jessilina is going to move on to the second round.\n\nSoon it\'s Kenny\'s turn, and he calls out his {{p|Machoke}} and tells it to use {{m|Focus Energy}}. This helps Machoke to show off its muscles. An enormous {{wp|barbell}} weighing three times Machoke\'s body weight is lowered onto the stage. Machoke uses {{m|Strength}} to lift it with one arm and switches to the other. Barry watched the appeal amazed and decides that he wants to eventually catch a Machoke. Brock comments on how Contest moves are usually graceful and beautiful so it was a smart move for Kenny to show off how strong Machoke is. Dawn admires from the back room while Jessie is indifferent as always. Kenny jumps up and handstands on top of the barbell Machoke is holding ending their presentation. The judges love it.\n\nIt\'s Dawn\'s turn next, and Kenny tells Dawn that she better get through to the battle as he wants the chance to defeat her this time. Not only would it make up for his loss to her in the {{to|Floaroma}} {{pkmn|Contest}}, but he also reveals that he saw Dawn compete in the [[Wallace Cup]] and he wants to be able to defeat the person who won it. Dawn promises her friend and rival that she\'ll do her best.\n\nDawn is next and calls out Ambipom with a [[Seal|Song Seal]] and orders for {{m|Double Team}} and {{m|Focus Punch}}. Ambipom Double Teams into a circle, uses Focus Punch on the {{wp|musical note}}s, dances in midair and covers the stage with sparkles. Brock comments on how Ambipom and Dawn are totally in sync, and Mamoswine opens its eyes to watch. Kenny cheers Dawn on from the back room. Then Ambipom uses {{m|Swift}}, hits the stars with her tail as a ping pong move, and spins around in midair swirling the stars around herself. Ambipom uses {{m|Double Hit}} and the stars break into sparkles. Marian and the judges love her performance and Mamoswine is impressed. Ash and friends notice Mamoswine watching and ask Mamoswine\'s opinion of Dawn\'s performance but goes back to napping.\n\nDawn joins Ash and his friends in the stands and is extremely nervous about making it to the Battle Stage. Dawn tells them that Kenny said he\'s very determined to win the Contest and Ash encourages her. Jessie, Kenny, and Dawn advance to the second round. Mamoswine shows some interest, Brock advises her to stay calm and Kenny and Dawn exchange friendly rivalry. Meowth and James praise Jessie and Mime Jr. Jessie will be using her Seviper for the battles.\n\nJessie, Dawn and Kenny defeat their first matched Coordinator. Jessie and Dawn battle in the semifinals and Dawn defeats her easily. James and Meowth are afraid of what will happen to them because Jessie lost.\n\nDawn and Kenny make it to the finals. Dawn uses Ambipom while Kenny uses his Prinplup. Mamoswine is wide awake and watching. Kenny begins with a {{m|Drill Peck}} and Dawn counters with Swift. Ambipom uses Double Team and Prinplup uses {{m|Bubble Beam}}. Ambipom hits the Bubble Beam back with a Focus Punch. Prinplup uses {{m|Metal Claw}} to hit them back again turning the Contest into a ping pong match. Marian says this ping pong exchange during a [[Contest Battle]] is a first. Prinplup uses Bubble Beam again right after a Metal Claw and Ambipom uses Double Hit to pop the bubbles. Prinplup uses Drill Peck, Ambipom uses Focus Punch and the two collide in midair. Prinplup uses Metal Claw while nosediving and spinning. Ambipom goes for a direct attack and tries to use Double Hit but it fails, leaving Ambipom wide-open to attack. Kenny has Prinplup use Drill Peck, and Prinplup lands a direct-hit which knocks out Ambipom, causing Dawn to be instantly eliminated and giving Kenny the win and the contest. Dawn praises Ambipom and Ash and co. are saddened. Jessie says that she needs another Pokémon to partner with for the next Contest and Meowth swears that he will win the next Contest. Raoul Contesta praises Kenny and hands him the Sandalstraw Contest Ribbon. Kenny says the Ribbon belongs to his Prinplup and Machoke. Dawn thinks she was hung up on getting her fifth Ribbon, and Brock says she should be proud for how well she performed in this Contest.\n\nKenny leaves to {{pkmn|training|train}} and {{pkmn2|caught|catch}} more {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. Both Dawn and Kenny promise that they will defeat the other the next time they meet. Barry suggests that Dawn should participate in the upcoming [[Pokémon Ping Pong Tournament]] because of how well Ambipom did during the ping pong exchange. Dawn asks Ambipom if she wants to enter, and Ambipom happily agrees. And so, with the excitement of the Sandalstraw Contest over, the gang look forward to their next challenge in the Pokémon Ping Pong Tournament.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:Kenny Sandalstraw Contest.png|thumb|220px|Kenny being awarded the Sandalstraw Ribbon]]\n* {{an|Dawn}}, {{si|Kenny}}, and [[Jessie|Jessilina]] compete in the [[Sandalstraw Town]] [[Pokémon Contest]].\n* Kenny is revealed to have obtained a {{p|Machoke}}.\n* Dawn battles Kenny in the finals and loses, resulting in her first loss to Kenny.\n* Kenny wins the Sandalstraw Contest and earns his fourth [[Ribbon]], the Sandalstraw Ribbon.\n* Kenny leaves the group.\n* {{TP|Dawn|Ambipom}} discovers her talent for ping pong.\n* Dawn decides to enter the [[Pokémon Ping Pong Tournament]] along with {{Ash}} and {{an|Barry}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* {{si|Kenny}}\n* {{an|Barry}}\n* [[Marian]]\n* [[Raoul Contesta]]\n* [[Mr. Sukizo]]\n* {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Piplup}} ({{OP|Dawn|Piplup}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Mime Jr.}} ({{OP|James|Mime Jr.}})\n* {{p|Aipom}} ([[Dawn\'s Ambipom|Ash\'s]]; flashback)\n* {{p|Buneary}} ({{OP|Dawn|Buneary}})\n* {{p|Pachirisu}} ({{OP|Dawn|Pachirisu}})\n* {{p|Ambipom}} ({{OP|Dawn|Ambipom}})\n* {{p|Mamoswine}} ({{OP|Dawn|Mamoswine}})\n* {{p|Happiny}} ({{OP|Brock|Happiny}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Prinplup}} ({{OP|Kenny|Prinplup}})\n* {{p|Machoke}} ({{si|Kenny}}\'s)\n* {{p|Empoleon}} ({{OP|Barry|Empoleon}})\n* {{p|Gabite}} ({{OP|Ursula|Gabite}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Gastrodon}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Haunter}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Vulpix}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Drowzee}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Stunky}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Flareon}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Seedot}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Bronzong}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Smoochum}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Shellder}} (Coordinator\'s)\n* {{p|Masquerain}} (Coordinator\'s)\n\n==Trivia==\n* There is no [[Professor Oak\'s Big Pokémon Examination]] following this episode.\n* This is the first episode in which {{si|Kenny}} is seen obtaining a {{pkmn|Contest}} [[Ribbon]] in person.
