It was first broadcast in Japan on June 3, 1997 and in the United States on September 21, 1998.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/01_10-bulbasaur-and-the-hidden-village/-->\n<i>Ash and Misty, while arguing, discover an Oddish. As Misty\'s Starmie weakens the Oddish, a Bulbasaur appears and fights Starmie while the Oddish runs off into the woods. Ash jumps in with his Butterfree, but the Bulbasaur is able to escape in the direction of the Oddish.\n\nOur heroes cross a river over a rope bridge that snaps, sending Brock into the river below. As Misty, Ash, and Pikachu hunt for Brock, they set off a couple of traps, finally landing in a net that hangs from a tree!\n\nFortunately, Brock shows up to cut them down, then brings them to meet a woman named Melanie, who takes care of wounded Pokémon like the Oddish—and sets traps to defend the Pokémon from poachers. The Bulbasaur, we learn, acts as a kind of bodyguard.\n\nMisty apologizes to the Oddish for attacking it earlier, but the Bulbasaur is still hostile because it dislikes Trainers. Meanwhile, Team Rocket has discovered the area and plans to snatch the weak Pokémon.\n\nWill Team Rocket have an advantage against Pokémon that are wounded and unable to defend themselves? And will that Bulbasaur ever warm up to Ash and his friends?</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} are wandering through the forest without a compass, trying to find the path to [[Vermilion City]]. Ash and {{an|Misty}} are fighting as usual, this time over who led them astray, while {{an|Brock}} tries to keep the peace. They pause for a rest, and Ash sees an {{DL|Melanie|Oddish}} taking a drink. Misty sends her {{TP|Misty|Starmie}} to fight the Oddish so she can {{pkmn2|Caught|catch}} it. The Oddish is defeated by {{m|Water Gun}}, but Misty\'s {{i|Poké Ball}} is deflected by a {{AP|Bulbasaur}} vine before she can claim it. The Bulbasaur attacks and defeats Starmie. Ash sends his {{AP|Butterfree}} after the Bulbasaur with a {{m|Sleep Powder}} attack, but Bulbasaur blows the powder back at Butterfree. Both the Oddish and the Bulbasaur run off into the forest.\n\nThe trio attempt to cross a rope bridge, but a wind starts to rip the bridge apart. Brock falls into the river below, while Misty and Pikachu cling to Ash. Ash ultimately manages to pull them up, and the three make their way to the end of the bridge. They make their way down to water level and go looking for Brock. At once, Misty falls into a pit trap not unlike those made by {{TRT}}. Ash pulls her out, and they go on looking. As they walk along, Misty\'s toe catches a rope, and they find themselves suspended in a net. They are found in this state by the Bulbasaur. Ash speculates that Brock has been washed to sea and shanghaied by pirates; moments later, Brock appears and frees them from the trap. Brock relays his river experience, and the fact that he was rescued from the rapids by a girl. Brock takes them to a village and introduces them to the girl, named [[Melanie]].\n\nAsh and Misty notice the large number of Pokémon in the village and wonder if they belong to Melanie. Brock explains that the [[Hidden Village]] is a place for abandoned or injured Pokémon to come to rest and relax. Melanie cares for them until they are better, and then they leave. Melanie collects plants to use for medicine, though she says that she is unqualified to be a Pokémon doctor. Misty teases Brock for falling in love with Melanie; he reacts a little violently, fearing Melanie might overhear. Melanie explains that she set the traps, including the rope bridge, to prevent [[Pokémon Trainer]]s from reaching the village and protect the injured Pokémon from being captured. Meanwhile, [[Jessie]], [[James]] and {{MTR}} try to cross the remains of the bridge, but it collapses underneath them and they fall into the river rapids.\n\nBrock promises Melanie that they will not try to catch any of the Pokémon in the village. Despite her earlier attempt to catch Oddish, Misty concurs. Ash worries if the traps are enough to keep robbers away, noting the idiocy of being caught in them. The camera cuts to Team Rocket, who have just fallen into their third pit trap. They finally manage to get out, only to immediately get caught in a net. Brock and Ash tend to a {{p|Staryu}}, while Misty apologizes to Oddish. She and Ash begin quarreling, and the Bulbasaur tackles Misty, thinking Oddish is in danger. Melanie explains that Bulbasaur has volunteered to protect the whole village. Bulbasaur tries to nudge Ash out of the village because it doesn\'t trust Pokémon Trainers.\n\nSuddenly, Team Rocket appears from behind a cloud, standing on a balloon-lifted platform, and recite their {{motto|mantra}}. They land in a clearing outside the village, and try to collect all the Pokémon in the village with a massive vacuum. As Brock herds everyone into the cabin, Oddish gets caught in the suction. Bulbasaur rescues Oddish with its {{m|Vine Whip}}, and Ash helps block the wind so it can carry Oddish to the cabin. Team Rocket move the vacuum directly over the cabin, so Bulbasaur uses its vines to smack the hose around. Ash instructs his {{AP|Pidgeotto}} to use {{m|Gust}}, and this causes a tornado that tosses Team Rocket and their platform into the distance.\n\nMelanie asks Ash to take the Bulbasaur with him, seeing the pair as a good match; the village is too small for its bulb to grow. She says the Pokémon have stayed in the village too long, because the Bulbasaur has done too good a job of protecting them. Bulbasaur agrees to go with Ash, on condition that they battle first. Ash sends Pikachu, who dodges Bulbasaur\'s vines but is tackled. Bulbasaur uses its Vine Whips to slam Pikachu into the ground, but Ash calls for a {{m|Thunderbolt}}, which uses Bulbasaur\'s vines as wires to shock it into submission, allowing Ash to catch it. Brock offers to stay and help, but Melanie refuses, telling him to continue on his adventures. The trio and Bulbasaur wave goodbye to Melanie as they continue their journey towards Vermilion City.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

In the dub, Ash attempts to break out of the net and Misty tells him his plan isn\'t working; and in the Japanese version, Ash attempts to break the net but the shaking of the net starts when Misty tells him his attempts to break out are leading to him touching her in inappropriate places.\n* Also, when Ash is guessing about what has happened to Brock, he speculates that he was picked up by pirates in the dub, while in the original he guesses that he was picked up by an ugly old hag washing clothes in the river.\n* In the dub when Melanie asked Ash if he thought Bulbasaur would be a good addition to his team, Ash responded, "Boy, would he ever!" Melanie also says Ash will "take great care of him." Bulbasaur\'s gender wasn\'t stated in the original version.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=AFA|bordercolor=FAA\n|ar={{tt|بولباسور و القرية المخفية|Bulbasaur and the hidden village }}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|神奇寶貝鄉的妙蛙種子 / 神奇宝贝乡的妙蛙种子|Bulbasaur of the Pokémon village}}\n|ca_vc={{tt|Bulbasaur i l’aldea oculta|Bulbasaur and the hidden village}}\n|cs={{tt|Bulbasaur a utajená vesnice|Bulbasaur and the Hidden Village}}\n|da={{tt|Bulbasaur Og Den Skjulte Landsby|Bulbasaur and the hidden village}}\n|nl={{tt|Bulbasaur en de Verborgen Stad|Bulbasaur and the hidden village}}\n|fi={{tt|Bulbasaur ja Pokémonien suojapaikka|Bulbasaur and the haven of Pokémon}}\n|fr_ca={{tt|Bulbasaur et le village caché|Bulbasaur and the hidden village}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Le village caché|The hidden village}}\n|de={{tt|Bisasam und das versteckte Idyll|Bulbasaur and the hidden idyll}}\n|he=בלבאזור והכפר הנסתר {{tt|\'\'Bulbasaur ve\'ha\'kfar ha\'nistar\'\'|Bulbasaur and the hidden village}}\n|hi=Bulbasaur और हिडन विलेग! {{tt|\'\'Bulbasaur aur Hidden Village\'\'|Bulbasaur and a Hidden Village}} {{tt|*|CN dub}} <br> बुल्बसौर और छुपाहूवा गाव! {{tt|\'\'Bulbasaur aur chipa hua Gaon!\'\'|Bulbasaur and a hidden village!}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n|hu={{tt|Bulbasaur és a titkos falu|Bulbasaur and the Hidden Village}}\n|it={{tt|Un\'oasi felice|A happy oasis}}{{tt|*|Original 2000 dub}} <br> {{tt|Bulbasaur e il villaggio nascosto|Bulbasaur and the hidden village}}{{tt|*|2014 K2 TV dub}}\n|ko=꿈에 그리던 이상해씨 {{tt|kkum-e geulideon isanghaessi|A dreamed Bulbasaur}}\n|no={{tt|Bulbasaur og den bortgjemte landsbyen|Bulbasaur and the Hidden Village}}\n|pl={{tt|Bulbasaur i ukryta osada|Bulbasaur and the hidden village}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Bulbasauro e a Vila Escondida|Bulbasaur and the hidden village}}<br>{{tt|Bulbasaur e a Vila Escondida|Bulbasaur and the Hidden Village}} <small>(Pokémon TV)</small>\n|pt_eu={{tt|Bulbasaur e a Aldeia Escondida|Bulbasaur and the hidden village}}\n|ro={{tt|Bulbasaur și Satul Ascuns|Bulbasaur and the hidden village}}\n|ru={{tt|Бульбасавр и спрятанное селение|Bulbasaur and the hidden village}}\n|sr={{tt|Булбасаур и скривено село|Bulbasaur and the hidden village}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡La Aldea Secreta de Bulbasaur!|Bulbasaur\'s secret village!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Bulbasaur y la aldea oculta|Bulbasaur and the hidden village}}\n|sv={{tt|Bulbasaur och hälsohemmet|Bulbasaur and the health resort}}{{tt|*|Pokémon TV, spoken title}}<br>{{tt|Bulbasaur och den gömda byn|Bulbasaur and the hidden village}}{{tt|*|VHS release}}\n|tr={{tt|Bulbasaur ve Saklı Köy|Bulbasaur and hidden village}}\n|uk={{tt|Бульбазавр та Заховане Селище|Bulbasaur and the hidden village}}\n|vi={{tt|Cuộc gặp gỡ thú vị|An interesting meeting}}\n}}\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP009 |\nprevtitle=The School of Hard Knocks |\nnextcode=EP011 |\nnexttitle=Charmander – The Stray Pokémon |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Kanto}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0010}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|010]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Yukiyoshi Ōhashi]]\n[[Category:Episodes by one-time storyboarders]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Hideki Hiroshima]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Masayuki Hiraoka]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Brock]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Ash]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a main character obtains a new Pokémon]]\n\n[[de:Bisasam und das versteckte Idyll]]\n[[es:EP010]]\n[[fr:EP010]]\n[[it:EP010]]\n[[ja:無印編第10話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第10集]]'}
