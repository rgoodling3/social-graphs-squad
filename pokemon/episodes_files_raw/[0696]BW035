Suddenly, they are stopped by Officer Jenny and two young detectives, Christie and Doyle, who accuse them of having something to do with the recent disappearance of several Audino. A background check reveals their innocence, and when Officer Jenny tells our heroes what’s been happening, they offer to help.\n\nSplitting up into three groups, they vow to find the missing Audino and keep an eye on the town’s remaining Audino, with the help of some high-tech tracking devices. But just as they begin the operation, the remaining Audino start moving, and everyone takes off after them!\n\nWhen the tracking signal gets jammed, Cilan speculates that someone might be controlling the wandering Audino and causing the tracking signals to fail by using high-frequency sound waves. With its excellent hearing, Ash’s Roggenrola leads the investigators to an abandoned wind farm, where they discover Team Rocket behind it all. Jessie, James, and Meowth have been luring the Audino, intending to use them as part of Doctor Zager’s powerful new radar device!\n\nA fierce battle ensues and Team Rocket’s sound-wave machine is destroyed, freeing the captured Audino. However, when Officer Jenny attempts to arrest the villainous trio, they escape once again. Fortunately the Audino are now free and safe, and our heroes can once again resume their journey to Nimbasa City!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAs {{ashfr|the group}} walks through fog, {{Ash}} wonders where they are going, while {{an|Iris}} and {{an|Cilan}} comment that they have never really found their way at all. Suddenly, {{AP|Pikachu}} calls out, seeing a shadow walking towards them. They initially mistake the mysterious shadow for a person, but Ash and Cilan find that it is just an unhappy {{p|Audino}}. Ash checks Audino on the Pokédex, though Cilan mentions there is something wrong with it. After many attempts to ask Audino what is wrong, and for directions, Audino ignores them and walks away.\n\nAfter Audino goes away, the fog clears, exciting the group. However, they are confronted by an [[Officer Jenny]] and two {{pkmn|Trainer}}s named [[Christie]] and [[Doyle]], who declare that they are under arrest. Both Christie and Doyle shout at them, claiming that they are the ones responsible for the disappearances of several Audino. The group protests, but the boy tells his {{p|Solosis}} to use {{m|Psychic}}; it obeys and lifts them off their feet.\n\nLater, the trio is still trying to explain that they would have never done anything illegal. Cilan tries to explain to Officer Jenny that he is the [[Striaton Gym]] [[Gym Leader|Leader]] and for her to confirm it. After making a phone call, Officer Jenny confirms that they haven\'t done anything wrong and apologizes. She then explains that many people\'s Audino have gone missing, and are possibly getting stolen. \n\nSubsequently, they go into Officer Jenny\'s office where she formally introduces them to Doyle and Christie. Both of them apologize for attacking them earlier, while Ash, Iris, and Cilan introduce themselves to them as well. Doyle then reveals one of the missing Audino is his grandfather\'s. He then gets angry again and berates the "evil organization" that is behind it. Christie asks what the evil organization could be doing, while her {{p|Gothita}} agrees. Doyle thinks for a while, and says that they possibly want to make a healing organization, something Christie doesn\'t think is likely.\n\nOfficer Jenny breaks up the subsequent squabble and she says that there are three Audino left in the town. Cilan gets very interested and decides to help on the case, claiming it is "detective time". Ash and Iris decide to help too, so they all split into pairs: Ash and Doyle, Iris and Christie, and Cilan and Officer Jenny. Before all of them could leave, Officer Jenny gives them a tracking device to put on the Audino and a screen to monitor where they are going. All of them agree and head off.\n\nAfter all three pairs provide the three remaining Audino with the tracking devices, all three Audino suddenly wander off on their own accord, and not even [[Poké Ball]]s can restrain them. While all three pairs are chasing their respective Audino, they suddenly hit a crossroads and meet up with each other, much to their surprise. They decide to head off together as a group from here on out, and begin their journey. After they lose track of the Audino, Cilan tells Ash to bring out his {{AP|Roggenrola}} to help them. \n\nHowever, after a while, the group find that the Audino have already gone up a ladder to somewhere, taking the ladder with them. Ash unsuccessfully tries numerous times to go and follow them, but to no avail. Doyle then has Solosis use Psychic to transport him and the others to the top.\n\nThey see the Audino walking away on a bridge. They attempt to walk across the bridge as well, but the Audino destroy it with Psychic. Doyle tries to get his Solosis to use Psychic yet again to carry them across, but Christie interrupts and tells her Gothita to use {{m|Telekinesis}}, which has the same effect.\n\nAfter venturing further, Roggenrola leads them to a base area where {{TRT}} was keeping the Audino captive. Team Rocket brings out {{TP|Jessie|Woobat}} and {{TP|James|Yamask}} to attack everyone; Doyle and Christie use their Pokémon to fight back. Ash has Roggenrola attack the machine that is keeping the Audino captive with {{m|Stone Edge}}, which destroys it and sets the Audino free. The Audino angrily deliver multiple attacks at Team Rocket. The trio then retreats with jetpacks, much to Officer Jenny\'s dismay. Doyle and Christie ask Officer Jenny who helped out more, and she explained to them that Roggenrola was really the one who helped solve the case the most.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
