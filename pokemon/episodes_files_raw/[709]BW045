Tired of camping in the woods, Cilan wishes for a good night’s sleep in the perfect hotel—and Beheeyem leads our heroes right to it! They settle in and quickly drift off...\n\n...only to be awakened by Officer Jenny of the Psychic Crimes Division, who tells them that they’ve been trapped in a dream! They quickly chase down the culprit: it’s Beheeyem’s Trainer, Leon, who introduces himself as “the greatest Dream Thief of all time.” Officer Jenny figures out that as long as they’re trapped in the dream, they’ll have no power against the Dream Thief.\n\nWith the help of Officer Jenny’s Duosion and its psychic powers, they break out of the dream world—but it turns out that was a dream within a dream, because all of the party’s Pokémon are still asleep and dreaming. Ash, Iris, and Cilan manage to wake their Pokémon quickly, but Meowth proves to be more of a challenge. His persistent snoozing keeps them trapped in layer after layer of dreams, until Cilan finally gets the sleepy Pokémon to wake up with some super-spicy Figy Berries!\n\nDecidedly not a “morning person,” Meowth is extra cranky at this treatment, and turns that frustration on Leon and Beheeyem, driving them away with a flurry of Fury Swipes. With the nightmare finally over, our heroes bid farewell to Officer Jenny and set off toward Nimbasa City once more.\n\nBut Jessie and James have beaten them there, and they’ve managed to divert one of the subway’s trains to a different route! The city’s two Subway Bosses discover this tampering, and prepare to deal with whatever happens next…</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAs {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} set up for dinner, {{MTR}} volunteers to look for firewood. Unbeknownst to them, a Dream Thief by the name of {{OBP|Leon|BW045}} is spying on them from a distance. He then sends out his {{p|Beheeyem}} to deceive them so that they may steal their Pokémon. While searching for firewood, Meowth meets Beheeyem who has plenty of firewood. Meowth brings it back with him and tells the gang that Beheeyem is willing to give them anything they want. {{an|Cilan}} wishes for {{b|Figy}} Berries to use in his dish instead of his {{b|Wiki}} Berries and Beheeyem succeeds in fulfilling Cilan\'s wish. Beheeyem asks if there is anything else they want, and {{an|Iris}} suggests that Ash wish for the rest of his Gym Badges, to which he declines. Cilan then decides he\'d like to sleep in a proper bed for the night, and Beheeyem leads them away from the camp.\n\nAs they wander into the wilderness, Beheeyem creates a hotel with its {{t|Psychic}} powers. The gang walks in but the hotel is empty, but Beheeyem leads them to their room which is exactly as Cilan described it. The gang jump on the bed and instantly fall asleep. Later, a figure breaks through the window, startling everyone awake. They begin to apologize for barging in and beg for mercy, but that\'s when the figure identifies itself as [[Officer Jenny]] and switches on the lights. Jenny introduces her partner, {{p|Duosion}}, and informs them that they are inside a dream created by Beheeyem, and to notice if anything around them is missing. They immediately notice that {{AP|Pikachu}}, {{TP|Iris|Axew}}, and Meowth are missing, along with all their Poké Balls, and have been stolen by Beheeyem. They chase Beheeyem down the hall, when they become blocked off by bars. Leon then appears and introduces himself as a Dream Thief, and then escapes. Officer Jenny explains that the only way to get out of the dream is to make everyone involved acknowledge that they are in a dream, and to strike an exit with a Psychic attack. Iris notices an exit, and Jenny has her Duosion hit it with {{m|Psywave}}.\n\nThey then find themselves outside, and Leon is tying their Pokémon up. Jenny battles against Leon, but with no avail and that\'s when Cilan notices that there are two moons, indicating that they are still dreaming. Ash and Iris then wake up Pikachu and Axew, but fail to wake up Meowth. Ash has Pikachu shock Meowth with {{m|Thunderbolt}}, and Duosion attacks another exit. Yet again they find themselves still in a dream when Leon appears from a UFO and flies away. Again they attempt to wake Meowth and exit the dream, but still Meowth insists on sleeping. Finally, after entering a dream with a giant Beheeyem, they hit Meowth with a combined Thunderbolt, {{m|Dragon Rage}}, and Psywave, as well as force feed Figy Berries to him which finally causes him to stay awake long enough for them to escape. Once out, Leon attempts to make his escape, only to be stopped by a cranky Meowth. Leon makes him an offer to become partners, but Meowth refuses after all he was just put through, and shreds Leon\'s clothes with {{m|Fury Swipes}}. With Leon finally in custody, Officer Jenny thanks the gang for their help and leaves. Meowth then realizes they should have asked Jenny to take them to the Pokémon Center, and they all groan at the realization.\n\nMeanwhile in [[Nimbasa City]], [[Jessie]] and [[James]] are conducting a final test on their subway train when they\'re noticed by {{FB|Subway Boss|Emmet}} and {{FB|Subway Boss|Ingo}}. The pair then decide to investigate, stating it is their duty as Subway Bosses to ensure the safety of the subway.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
