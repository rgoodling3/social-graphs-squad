It was first broadcast in Japan on December 11, 2003 and in the United States on November 20, 2004.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/07_15-poetry-commotion/-->\n<i>Ash and friends arrive in Lavaridge Town. Ash heads straight for the Gym, where the Gym Leader Flannery is running around on fire. Brock uses Mudkip to douse the flames, and everyone goes inside for the Gym battle. The battlefield is a mess, so they need to clean up first.\n\nThey find out Flannery just inherited the Gym Leader position from her grandfather, who left town to write Pokémon poetry. None of the kids know that he\'s actually spying on them because he\'s worried about Flannery. He comes back in disguise and offers to help Flannery out.\n\nTeam Rocket also shows up in disguise to help clean the field, but instead they steal Flannery\'s Torkoal. They try to fly away in their balloon, but are stopped by the grandfather, who teams up with Flannery for a Pokémon battle with Jessie and James. May and Max free Torkoal.\n\nDuring the battle, Flannery\'s Slugma evolves into Magcargo. Flannery realizes her grandfather is there, and together they defeat Team Rocket. Everyone gets ready for the Gym battle the next day.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrive at [[Lavaridge Town]], which is said to be famous for its hot springs. [[Max]] observes people being buried in the sand in the dry analogue to hot springs, the sand baths. Ash quickly reminds the team that his [[Gym]] {{pkmn|battle}} is the reason they came here in the first place, and the group reluctantly agrees. {{TRT}} arrives to the town shortly after, complaining about their troubles following Ash. [[James]] reminds them about the hot springs in the town, and the trio is led by [[Jessie]] straight to the springs. James and {{MTR}} are worried about their pending mission that they have yet to complete. Ash arrives at the Gym to [[Flannery]] running around in panic as she has caught on fire. After {{an|Brock}} extinguishes her with {{TP|Brock|Mudkip}}, he falls in love, only to be pulled away by Max. Ash informs Flannery that he is looking for a Gym battle, and Flannery becomes excited at the chance to battle. Brock expresses concerns that he believed the Gym Leader of the town was [[Mr. Moore]], not Flannery as she perpetuates. This is re-enforced by Flannery\'s disregard for protocol when she begins battling Ash on a non-regulation field. It is then discovered that the official field has not been cleaned since her last battle.\n\nThe match is put off as Flannery, Ash, and friends take a break. Flannery explains that three days ago her grandfather, Mr. Moore, had left on a poetry writing mission across [[Hoenn]] and [[Johto]], and appointed Flannery as the Gym Leader. Ash volunteers the group to help clean up the Gym with Flannery. Mr. Moore is shown to not have gone very far from Lavaridge, expressing concerns for Flannery and the Gym. He sees (in disguise) that Ash is helping Flannery clean up the Gym, and is worried that things are not going as hoped. {{TRT}} appears to be watching too, and decides to catch Flannery\'s {{p|Torkoal}}. Brock brings up that Flannery should have a {{badge|Heat}} ready in case Ash does beat her in the match. Flannery is not sure where they are located though, and she has the team help her search for the Badges. Mr. Moore appears in a new disguise to point out the location of the Badges. Flannery admits that she should be more organized. Max points out that Flannery does not have a match judge. Mr. Moore appears in a new disguise, claiming to be from the CPPGJ, or the Committee for Popularizing Pokémon Gym Judging. Brock is suspicious, but the disguised Mr. Moore exclaims that he was sent by Mr. Moore to judge the match. Mr. Moore also volunteers to help fix the field to prepare for the match.\n\nAs the field is being repaired, the Team Rocket trio also appears to help repair the Gym. Flannery accepts the aid. Mr. Moore and the trio recognize each other from earlier. When Mr. Moore sees the trio trying to steal Flannery\'s Torkoal, the trio is discovered and begins the [[Team Rocket mottos|motto]]. Jessie sends out {{TP|Jessie|Seviper}} to fill the Gym with a {{m|Haze}} attack. As the trio makes a run for it, Mr. Moore sends his {{p|Wingull}} to punch a hole in the trio\'s balloon. Flannery realizes her grandfather has a Wingull just like it. Wingull bursts Team Rocket\'s balloon and they fall down. When Mr. Moore sends out {{p|Typhlosion}} to battle the trio, Flannery realizes who the mystery man is. Jessie sends out Seviper while James sends out {{TP|James|Cacnea}} who turns to hug him. Seviper starts off with {{m|Poison Tail}} and hits Typhlosion but Typhlosion strikes back with {{m|Tackle}}. Cacnea uses {{m|Pin Missile}} but Flannery helps in the battle with her {{p|Slugma}}, Mag and uses {{m|Ember}} to block. Typhlosion uses {{m|Flame Wheel}} and it hits Cacnea. Seviper goes for a {{m|Wrap}} but it got hit by Typhlosion\'s {{m|Flamethrower}}. Cacnea goes for another Pin Missile but got hit by another Flamethrower by Typhlosion. \n\nMax and {{an|May}} sneak around to rescue Torkoal. Meowth sees them and goes to attack them but Flannery stops him with Mag\'s Flamethrower. Cacnea and Seviper both attack using {{m|Needle Arm}} and {{m|Bite}} but they both got hit by Slugma\'s Flamethrower. Flannery\'s Slugma evolves into {{p|Magcargo}}, and when Mr. Moore congratulates her, Flannery refers to him as grandpa, and it is revealed that he is Mr. Moore. Team Rocket comments on the absurdity of Mr. Moore spying on his own house. Cacnea continues the battle using Pin Missile, but Flannery\'s Magcargo and Mr. Moore\'s Typhlosion both uses Flamethrower to send them back. The trio is defeated in the battle, and Ash and {{AP|Pikachu}} send them flying with a {{m|Thunderbolt}}. The group finishes repairing the Gym, and Mr. Moore suggests they postpone the Gym Battle until tomorrow. Mr. Moore buries Ash and Friends in the sand, and some competitive dialog is exchanged between Ash and Flannery, both excited about their upcoming Gym Battle.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrive in [[Lavaridge Town]] and meet [[Flannery]], the local [[Gym Leader]].\n* One of Flannery\'s {{p|Slugma}}, Mag, evolves into {{p|Magcargo}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* [[Flannery]]\n* [[Mr. Moore]]\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Torkoal}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{an|Giovanni}} ([[Boss fantasy|fantasy]])\n* [[Flannery]]\n* [[Mr. Moore]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:PTC AG055.png|thumb|200px|right|Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]\n[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]: {{p|Togetic}}\n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Treecko}} ({{OP|Ash|Treecko}})\n* {{p|Torchic}} ({{OP|May|Torchic}})\n* {{p|Mudkip}} ({{OP|Brock|Mudkip}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Cacnea}} ({{OP|James|Cacnea}})\n* {{p|Slugma}} ([[Flannery]]\'s; Meg)\n* {{p|Slugma}} ([[Flannery]]\'s; Mag; evolves)\n* {{p|Magcargo}} ([[Flannery]]\'s; Mag; newly evolved)\n* {{p|Torkoal}} ([[Flannery]]\'s; debut)\n* {{p|Typhlosion}} ([[Mr. Moore]]\'s)\n* {{p|Wingull}} ([[Mr. Moore]]\'s)\n* {{p|Vileplume}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Doduo}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Politoed}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Breloom}} (flashback)\n\n==Trivia==\n* The English title is based on the idiom "\'\'poetry in motion\'\'".\n* This is the first episode in the {{series|Advanced Generation}} where [[Jessie\'s Wobbuffet]] does not appear.\n\n===Errors===\n* Even though [[Flannery]] initially claims that {{Ash}} is her first challenger, she later says that her last opponent used {{m|Dig}} a lot.\n* When [[Jessie]] sends out {{TP|Jessie|Seviper}} to use {{m|Haze}}, {{AP|Pikachu}} is heard but isn\'t seen on Ash\'s shoulder.

This was due to Typhlosion being unable to learn Headbutt at the time.\n\n====[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]====\n* Question: Trainers, which one of these Pokémon is the best choice to battle {{p|Tyrogue}}?\n* Choices: {{p|Dustox}}, {{p|Togetic}}, {{p|Suicune}}\n* Answer: OK, Trainers!
