It was first broadcast in Japan on January 5, 2006 and in the United States on October 21, 2006. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/09_13-queen-of-the-serpentine/-->\n<i>Ash heads for the Battle Pike ahead of his friends, and finds himself at a facility staffed by three suspiciously familiar faces and their Wobbuffet. Ever trusting, Ash challenges their "Pike Queen Lucy" to a battle. In the meantime, the real Battle Pike crew has come to meet the new challenger, and they\'re displeased when Ash doesn\'t show. Brock is instantly smitten by Lucy, the real Pike Queen, who comes to the rescue when Team Rocket reveals their fake Battle Pike and tries to run off with Pikachu. She bursts their bubble and defeats Jessie\'s Seviper with a powerful Seviper of her own.\n\nNow the real Battle Pike challenge can start! First, Lucy\'s Seviper battles Ash\'s Donphan. Even without using defensive moves, Seviper and its Flamethrower attack are tough to beat! Scott explains that Lucy\'s style is to forget about defense and just hit as hard as possible, but this strategy works against Lucy when Donphan uses a fiery Rollout to defeat Seviper.\n\nNext up is Milotic, who knocks Donphan out with a one-shot Hydro Pump. Pikachu enters the field, only to take the brunt of Milotic\'s powered-up offense. Ash has to think quickly and figure out how to use Milotic\'s strength against it, ordering Pikachu to take advantage of Milotic\'s moves to boost its own attack. This does the trick and knocks Milotic out, earning Ash the Luck Symbol. Ash and his friends are now headed for the Battle Palace and May\'s next Contest... but before they leave, Brock manages to make a sweet impression on Lucy after all!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} is eager to face the next [[Frontier Brain]] as he, {{an|Brock}} and [[Max]] step outside of the [[Pokémon Center]]. However, {{TP|Brock|Bonsly}} begins to cry uncontrollably, startling Ash, and Brock tells them it\'s feeding time, asking them to go ahead without him. Ash agrees, then wonders where {{an|May}} is. Max tells him that she did say she wanted to show her {{TP|May|Eevee}} the ocean. Seeing Ash\'s bewildered look, Max tells him not to worry and leaves to find his sister. Ash and {{AP|Pikachu}} meanwhile continue to the [[Battle Pike]] without them.\n\nMeanwhile, Ash and Pikachu arrive at the Battle Pike. [[James]], {{MTR}} and {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} [[List of Team Rocket\'s disguises|disguised as three attendants]] welcome Ash inside and guide him through to [[Jessie]], posing as [[Pike Queen Lucy]], the Battle Pike Frontier Brain. Jessie welcomes Ash and accidentally calls him a \'[[twerp]]\' but quickly corrects her words. Failing to notice it, Ash challenges her to a match. But before the match could begin, James holds up a container which he calls the Pikachu Power Purifier, and instructs Ash to place Pikachu inside.\n\nIn the meantime, Max and May regroup with Brock as they plan to head to the Battle Pike to watch Ash’s match. Before they have a chance to move, three girls came up to them - the blonde, [[Barbara]], asking which of them is Ash Ketchum. Brock explains that Ash already left for the Battle Pike some time ago. Outraged, Barbara tells them they came to greet Ash on behalf of Queen Lucy. May asks if Ash was expecting them, with Barbara answering that she couldn\'t care less if he was. Fortunately, [[Scott]] comes in the nick of time to stop the arguing. Brock, May and Max greet Scott. He says that the Battle Pike is closed today and he was coming to greet the girls. May asks Scott if he means he was here to greet Lucy, when Barbara yells to address her as Queen Lucy. The Pike Queen herself arrives, announcing her arrival with a Seviper-patterned whirligig projectile. She apologizes to Brock and the others for Barbara\'s rudeness. Brock instantly goes down on one knee, proclaiming his love for the Frontier Brain. He is quickly pulled away by Barbara while Lucy is left speechless and blushing from the sudden encounter.\n\nMeanwhile, Jessie places Pikachu inside of the container for Ash. After the lid is closed, a net suddenly falls down on Ash and {{TRT}} reveal themselves. Making their escape, the walls fall and the real Battle Pike is revealed behind the fake one. Team Rocket flies away in their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|balloon]] with Pikachu trapped, while Ash struggles to free himself. Ash tells Pikachu to use {{m|Thunderbolt}} but it has no effect inside the box. Lucy comes running in, throwing her red rose projectile at the balloon and causing a puncture. Team Rocket\'s balloon tumbled to the ground with the box holding Pikachu falling out and opening. Everyone rushes to the scene, and Scott informs Ash that this is the real Lucy, surprising Ash and Team Rocket. Not too happy, Jessie sends out her {{TP|Jessie|Seviper}}. While Ash is preparing to battle her, Lucy tells him to let her deal with Jessie and sends out her own {{TP|Lucy|Seviper}}. The group are surprised about Lucy\'s Pokémon, but Barbara remarks that Lucy\'s Seviper is stronger than Jessie\'s. Angered, Jessie tells Seviper to use {{m|Poison Tail}} and Lucy orders her to do the same. The two clash, though Lucy’s Seviper sends its opponent back towards Team Rocket. To finish them off, Lucy\'s Seviper uses {{m|Flamethrower}}, sending Team Rocket blasting off. Scott re-introduces Pike Queen Lucy. Ash asks Lucy to battle her, but Brock tells him that the Battle Pike is closed today, so they would have to come back tomorrow. Hearing those words, Lucy blushes, then said that the Battle Pike is open for \'\'good friends\'\'. The group realizes that Ash can challenge Lucy now while Brock flirts with her again only to be dragged away by Max. \n\nInside the real Battle Pike, Ash analyzes the water and land battlefield. The referee announces the battle will be two-on-two. Lucy calls out her Seviper and Ash calls out his {{AP|Donphan}}. Scott is impressed by Ash’s choice, remarking that that Donphan is resistant to {{t|Poison}} attacks. Donphan starts the battle by using {{m|Take Down}}, though Seviper defends itself with Poison Tail. Lucy commands Seviper to use {{m|Bite}}, but Donphan quickly uses {{m|Defense Curl}} to negate the strength of Seviper\'s attack. The stat boost from Defense Curl makes Donphan’s follow up {{m|Rollout}} cause double the damage to Seviper. Donphan uses Rollout again, but Seviper dodges and lands a Poison Tail from behind. Donphan is sent rolling towards a wall, but Ash tells Donphan to use the energy from the roll to jump. Donphan obeys and uses Take Down directly at Seviper. Lucy closes her eyes, bewildering Ash and his supporters. Scott tells them that it\'s just her battle style and to their surprise, Seviper uses Flamethrower at the exact moment Lucy tells it to, knocking Donphan down. Donphan begins to charge its {{m|Hyper Beam}} attack, even with Seviper\'s Poison Tail coming at it. Donphan maintains its stance and unleashes the Hyper Beam at Seviper, but Seviper uses Poison Tail towards the water to make a huge veil of smoke. Seviper uses Flamethrower at Donphan, but Donphan dodges and used Rollout. Seviper re-directs the Flamethrower, turning Donphan into a ball of fire. Ash orders Donphan to head for Seviper, and it uses a rock to catapult itself up in the air, hitting Seviper and knocking it out. The referee announces Ash as the victor of the first round. May and Max talk about how great Ash and Donphan were, while Barbara and the girls whine over Seviper\'s defeat. Barbara cheers Lucy on, closely followed by Brock, making Lucy blush again. May stares at Brock, asking him whose side he is on. Brock stands and yells that he\'s rooting for both of them, but Max grabs his ear and pulls him back into his seat.\n\nLucy sends out her second Pokémon, {{p|Milotic}}. Donphan quickly goes for a direct Take Down attack, despite Ash knowing he\'s leaving himself open for a counterattack. Lucy smiles and orders Milotic use {{m|Hydro Pump}}, knocking Donphan out with one hit. Ash sends Pikachu in as his second Pokémon. Pikachu uses Thunderbolt on Milotic, Lucy lets the attack hit, shocking Ash. Milotic disperses the attack with its tail and strikes Pikachu down with Hydro Pump. Scott and Barbara explain that Lucy prefers offense moves rather than defensive moves. Brock displays his love speech towards Lucy again and proclaims they would make a perfect couple. Barbara shouts at Brock and her two friends pout, but Lucy blushes happily. Impressed at her battle skills, Ash tells Pikachu to use {{m|Iron Tail}}, but is pushed away by Milotic\'s own Iron Tail attack. Pikachu tries a {{m|Quick Attack}}, but Milotic responds with {{m|Twister}} and Hydro Pump consecutively, repelling Pikachu. As Milotic is about to use Iron Tail again, Pikachu sprints into a {{m|Volt Tackle}}, landing a direct hit. Before Pikachu can use Quick Attack to finish it off, Milotic’s {{m|Facade}} knocks Pikachu back. Lucy commands Milotic to use Twister once again, so Ash orders Pikachu to head directly into it and use Volt Tackle at maximum power. Pikachu rushes through the Twister and collides into Milotic\'s tail, causing an explosion. Milotic falls to the ground, surrounded by static and knocked out. The referee renders Milotic unable to battle and victory goes to Ash. Lucy and Ash shake hands and thank each other for a great battle. For winning, Lucy awards Ash the [[Symbol|Luck Symbol]].\n\nScott reminds Ash that his next Frontier battle will be at the [[Battle Palace]]. Max quickly checks his [[PokeNav]], and informs everyone that the Battle Palace is on [[Metallica Island]], near {{an|Seafoam Island}}. May is particularly excited, admitting that it has been a while since they last traveled across water. Before they leave, Brock grasps Lucy\'s hands and asks if she would consider joining them, making the Pike Queen blush. Max pulls Brock away as the group leaves for the next Battle Frontier Facility. Scott, Barbara and her friends wave them goodbye.\n\nLater, Lucy returns house where she is greeted by various Pokémon including {{p|Skitty}}, {{p|Snorlax}} and several others. She hugs them and blushes, saying that she met someone today with eyes that reminded her of them.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:Ash Luck Symbol.png|thumb|220px|Ash holding the Luck Symbol]]\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrive at the [[Battle Pike]] and meet [[Pike Queen Lucy]], the fourth [[Frontier Brain]].\n* Ash battles Lucy and wins, earning the [[Symbol|Luck Symbol]].\n* Ash learns that the next {{gdis|Battle Frontier|III}} facility, the [[Battle Palace]], is on [[Metallica Island]] near [[Seafoam Islands]].\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* {{FB|Pike Queen|Lucy}}\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{FB|Pike Queen|Lucy}}\n* [[Scott]]\n* [[Barbara]] \n* Female referee \n* Two female students\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Mime Jr.}} ({{OP|James|Mime Jr.}})\n* {{p|Donphan}} ({{OP|Ash|Donphan}})\n* {{p|Eevee}} ({{OP|May|Eevee}})\n* {{p|Bonsly}} ({{OP|Brock|Bonsly}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Lucy|Seviper}}) \n* {{p|Milotic}} ([[Pike Queen Lucy|Lucy]]\'s)\n* {{p|Abra}} ([[Pike Queen Lucy|Lucy]]\'s)\n* {{p|Snorlax}} ([[Pike Queen Lucy|Lucy]]\'s)\n* {{p|Cyndaquil}} ([[Pike Queen Lucy|Lucy]]\'s)\n* {{p|Swinub}} ([[Pike Queen Lucy|Lucy]]\'s)\n* {{p|Makuhita}} ([[Pike Queen Lucy|Lucy]]\'s)\n* {{p|Skitty}} ([[Pike Queen Lucy|Lucy]]\'s)\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:Battle Frontier - Group Shot 3.png|thumb|300px|Eevee in the opening]]\n* [[May\'s Eevee]] was added to the opening credits.\n* The [[L·O·V·E·L·Y ~Dream-Seeing LOVELY BOY~]] instrumental and [[Pokémon Symphonic Medley]] is used as background music.\n* At first, [[Barbara]] does [[Max]]\'s usual job of dragging {{an|Brock}}\'s ear in this episode, while Max does it himself later.\n\n===Errors===\n* In the scene in which {{FB|Pike Queen|Lucy}}\'s students were congratulating her after blasting {{TRT}} off, [[Barbara]]\'s belly button is stretched down.\n* The first time {{TP|Jessie|Seviper}} uses {{m|Poison Tail}} on {{AP|Donphan}}, it attacks from the left.
