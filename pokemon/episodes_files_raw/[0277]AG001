A New Adventure!!\'\') is the first episode of the {{series|Advanced Generation}} and the 275th episode of the overall Pokémon anime. It was first broadcast in Japan on November 21, 2002 and in the United States on March 15, 2003 as part of a special preview. It was later broadcast in sequence in the United States on November 1, 2003.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/06_13-get-the-show-on-the-road/-->\n<i>Team Rocket\'s failed attempt to catch Pikachu has left the little yellow Pokémon dangerously ill. Littleroot Town has no Pokémon Center so Ash turns to Professor Birch for help. Professor Birch thinks that Pikachu can be cured—but first they\'ll have to catch it. Delirious with fever, Pikachu has run off into the forest. Meanwhile, a girl named May is also going to see Professor Birch in order to receive her first Pokémon. She arrives just in time to save the professor from a pack of mad Poochyena. Before he can explain why he\'s running around in woods, Professor Birch runs off in search of the missing Pikachu. Time is running out and Pikachu is in danger of exploding. In a twisted turn of events, Team Rocket\'s latest Pikachu-catching contraption ends up saving the day.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{an|May}} is riding her [[Bicycle|bike]] towards [[Littleroot Town]]. Although today is the day she will receive her first {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} from [[Professor Birch]], she admits that she would rather just travel, and is not really interested in training Pokémon. Suddenly, a {{p|Duskull}} appears next to her and scares her. She speeds off, loses control and crashes into a tree. She continues onward, before stopping briefly to take in the view when she reaches a cliff overlooking Littleroot Town.\n\nMeanwhile, {{Ash}} is also arriving in Littleroot Town but all he can think about is trying to heal {{AP|Pikachu}}. He then wonders if there\'s a [[Pokémon Center]] in town, and hopes that [[Nurse Joy]] can inspect Pikachu to see if he\'s okay. On the upper deck, {{TRT}} hears the call for Littleroot Town. All are eager to enter this new land except for [[Jessie]], who reminisces about her past and subtly reveals that she has been to Littleroot Town before. She enters a depressed state, and as [[James]] presses for answers, Jessie doesn\'t elaborate. When the boat docks, Ash disembarks and asks the port attendant where the Pokémon Center is. He is saddened to learn that there is none in the small town. He is about to give up when he remembers Professor Birch, and wonders if he would be able to heal Pikachu. He calls Birch\'s lab, only to find that he is out doing field work. {{OBP|Joshua|assistant}}, his assistant, tells Ash to stay where he is and that he will alert the Professor to the situation as soon as possible.\n\nAsh waits on a bench, anxious for any word from the Professor. Out of the blue, Ash hears a screeching noise. He looks up to see Professor Birch in a SUV. Birch asks if Ash is the one who called about Pikachu, and he immediately responds. He carries Pikachu into the SUV and they speed off. Along the way back to the lab, Birch quickly diagnoses Pikachu with an electric overload, and Ash adds that he was [[EP274|strapped to Team Rocket\'s giant magnet]]. If the {{t|Electric}} Pokémon doesn\'t receive immediate attention, he might explode from all the energy. Their only hope is to drain all of it out of Pikachu. Once at the lab, the Professor attaches a machine to Pikachu\'s cheeks, while Joshua turns it on. However, Pikachu\'s electricity levels are so high, they cause the machine to explode. Pikachu then escapes, and Ash runs after him. Upon finding out Ash isn\'t carrying any other Pokémon, Birch grabs the three [[starter Pokémon]] and runs after the young {{pkmn|Trainer}}. Joshua reminds Birch that the starters are supposed to be for May who is due to arrive that day, and Birch tells Joshua to ask May to wait until he gets back. As he explains this, Ash is desperately calling out and searching for Pikachu, but the Pokémon is nowhere to be found.\n\nMeanwhile, May arrives at the lab. Joshua tells her that the Professor will be right back, but she ignores him and goes looking for Birch. She is unaware that he has fallen off a cliff and landed on top of a {{p|Poochyena}} while looking for Pikachu. After recovering, he apologizes to the Pokémon, but it just appears to get angrier. Two more Poochyena appear and they all begin to growl at the Professor. He realizes that they\'re about attack. Although initially proud of his knowledge, he soon realizes that their anger is directed at him, and runs away trying to escape from them.\n\nAs he takes shelter in a tree, May arrives and inquires as to why he is climbing a tree. Relieved that somebody has arrived, he tells May to get one of his Pokémon from his bag to ward off the Poochyena. Hesitantly, she takes out a {{i|Poké Ball}} and sends out {{p|Mudkip}}. The Professor tells her to command it to use an attack, but May is unfamiliar with the Pokémon\'s [[move]]s. Birch tells her to have it use {{m|Water Gun}}. When she commands it, the {{type|Water}} Pokémon sprays her in the face. Frustrated, Birch falls from his branch and is being pursued once again. He calls after Mudkip, who rushes to his side. Birch commands the Pokémon to use Water Gun on the Poochyena, scaring them off. Birch then realizes that Ash and Pikachu are still missing, and has May follow him.\n\nPikachu continues to weaken and become frightened. When Ash approaches him, Pikachu\'s eyes glow red as he furiously attacks him with {{m|Thunderbolt}}, thinking he is an enemy. Birch and May reach the area and see Ash dive off a cliff to save his friend. Luckily, he manages to grab onto a branch, but he is far from danger. Pikachu continues shocking him, and even bites him at one point to try to get away. Eventually, Ash calms Pikachu down, and he slowly realizes who is holding him. The Trainer makes it back up the cliff and meets up with the Professor and May.\n\nJust then, Team Rocket appears in their latest [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|mecha]], a giant battery robot. When May and Birch inquire about them, Ash informs them about the trio and their evil ways. {{MTR}} brags about the mecha\'s ability to absorb electricity and grabs Pikachu with one of the machine\'s arms. Team Rocket then has the machine put suction cups on Pikachu\'s cheeks to absorb his electricity. As James and Meowth celebrate the fact the machine is filling up with energy, Jessie yells at them, saying that Pikachu is getting stronger. After getting most of the energy drained, Pikachu shocks the machine, and a stray bolt of electricity fries May\'s bike. Then, the robot blasts Team Rocket off by exploding on them. This time, Jessie is happy, claiming she feels completely recharged thanks to Pikachu. However, the Electric Pokémon collapses on the ground, causing Ash to panic once again.\n\nBack at Birch\'s lab, the Professor determines that Team Rocket\'s machine drained all the excess energy out of Pikachu until his levels were returned to normal levels. After a rest, he says that Pikachu should make a full recovery. With that situation over, Birch now turns his attention to May and her first Pokémon. He first shows her {{p|Treecko}}, but May thinks the {{type|Grass}} looks scary. Mudkip is next, but May says she doesn\'t want it because it refused to listen to her. Finally, the Professor reveals {{p|Torchic}}, a {{type|Fire}}. The Pokémon hops up to May and begins brushing up against her leg. She then decides that she will take {{TP|May|Torchic}} as her first Pokémon. Birch gives her six empty Poké Balls and a [[Pokédex]]. She makes a few comments under her breath, Birch wondering what she said before she tries to cover it up.\n\nThe next morning May looks at her bike, angry that it has been destroyed. She goes to find Ash and scold him, but when she opens the door, she finds Ash still asleep by Pikachu\'s bedside. May softens up and watches as Ash mutters a few things in his sleep and Pikachu awakens. The Pokémon soon wakes up Ash, and Pikachu\'s reassuring nudge instantly cheers Ash up. May then realizes that her bike can wait. Outside, May releases Torchic and Ash soon steps outside. May greets him and Pikachu leaps off Ash\'s shoulder to meet Torchic. The two Pokémon soon play around, and Ash comments that Pikachu has already made his first friend in the [[Hoenn]] [[region]]. Later, Birch and Joshua inform the pair that their next destination should be [[Oldale Town]]\'s Pokémon Center to register for the [[Hoenn League]]. May makes a few remarks about going alone. Then, she purposely says she would have, but Pikachu destroyed her bike. May asks Ash if she could come along with him, and Ash agrees. The pair waves goodbye to the Professor and his assistant before beginning their walk towards Oldale Town.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:May choosing Torchic.png|thumb|220px|May choosing Torchic as her starter]]\n* {{Ash}} arrives in [[Littleroot Town]] and meets with [[Professor Birch]].\n* Ash meets {{an|May}}, a beginning {{pkmn|Trainer}}.\n* May encounters {{TRT}} for the first time.\n* {{AP|Pikachu}} accidentally destroys May\'s [[bicycle|bike]].\n* Team Rocket accidentally heals Pikachu.\n* May starts her [[Pokémon journey]] with a {{TP|May|Torchic}}, a [[Pokédex]], and six {{i|Poké Ball}}s.\n* Ash and May decide to travel together.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* {{an|May}}\n* [[Professor Birch]] (in person)\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* Starter Pokémon of Hoenn:\n** {{p|Torchic}} ({{OP|May|Torchic}})\n** {{p|Treecko}}\n** {{p|Mudkip}}\n* {{p|Poochyena}}\n* {{p|Beautifly}}\n\n=====TV episode debuts=====\n* {{p|Duskull}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Professor Birch]]\n* {{OBP|Joshua|assistant}}\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP AG001.png|thumb|200px|right|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Lanturn}}\n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Torchic}} ({{OP|May|Torchic}}, new; debut)\n* {{p|Treecko}} ([[starter Pokémon]]; debut)\n* {{p|Mudkip}} ([[starter Pokémon]]; debut)\n* {{p|Poochyena}} (debut)\n* {{p|Beautifly}} (debut)\n* {{p|Wingull}}\n* {{p|Duskull}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* This episode aired in Japan on the same day that {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}} was first released. The dubbed version aired two days before the games\' release in North America.\n** \'\'[[EP238|Nice Pryce, Baby!]]\'\' had been the previous episode the air in North America, leaving 36 more Johto episodes to air before the end of the [[original series]].\n* On DVD releases of [[S06|Pokémon: Advanced]], this episode is considered the season premiere. However, on televised airings, that title falls to \'\'[[EP263|Address Unown!]]\'\'.\n* [[Advance Adventure]] replaced [[Ready Go!]] as the [[List of Japanese opening themes|Japanese opening theme]].\n* [[Because the Sky is There]] replaced [[Pocket-ering Monster-ing]] as the [[List of Japanese ending themes|Japanese ending theme]].\n* Kanji are used in episode titles for the first time starting from this episode.\n* The [[eyecatch]]es shown in this episode feature Ash and May.\n* The dub title is based on the idiom "\'\'Let\'s get this show on the road\'\'".\n* The title card sequence changes to show a map of [[Hoenn]] and {{Ash}}\'s location on it. In the Japanese version, the music is also changed to the successful evolution fanfare from the games, while the English dub continues to use the [[original series]] theme until {{TPCi}}\'s dub begins.\n[[File:May bike destroyed.png|thumb|200px|May\'s bike destroyed]]\n* Ash\'s journey in Hoenn begins [[EP001|much like Kanto]], with {{AP|Pikachu}} being injured and destroying {{an|May|a girl}}\'s bike.\n* Although May claims {{p|Treecko}} are "creepy" in this episode, she says they are "cute" [[AG007|six episodes later]].\n* Music from \'\'[[M02|The Power of One]]\'\' is used.\n* This is the first [[region]] with no cameo by a Legendary Pokémon in the first episode. [[XY001|Kalos]] is the second.\n** However, Ash saw {{an|Ho-Oh}} before he [[EP273|left for Hoenn]] at the end of the [[original series]].\n* Pikachu having problems with his electricity in this episode is seen again in a [[BW002|later episode]].\n\n===Errors===\n* Although Ash and Pikachu go to [[Littleroot Town]] by boat, neither the {{pkmn|anime}} nor any Generation III [[Hoenn]] map show water surrounding Littleroot Town. This may have been changed for the anime so that Ash could start his Hoenn journey there.\n* After May hits the tree with her bike, her sleeves are longer than normal.\n* Just before Mudkip uses Water Gun, its jaw turns the same color as its body when it should be a lighter shade of blue.\n* When Ash gets up and goes toward Pikachu, the top part of his hat is green.\n* When Professor Birch throws the rope to Ash, the tree he was holding onto is gone, and he is holding the rope.\n* When Joshua is directing Ash and May to [[Oldale Town]], Professor Birch\'s lab is missing its whole left section. This section then reappears in the next perspective change, when May is talking.\n* In the {{pmin|Norway|Norwegian}} dub, when Ash throws himself off the ledge to save Pikachu, the English dub voices are used for Ash, Professor Birch, and May.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:AG001 error.png|Mudkip error\n</gallery>\n\n===Dub edits===\n* This episode was first aired on {{DL|Pokémon in the United States|Kids\' WB!}} as a sneak peek in March 2003 when {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}} were released. The version that has aired since has a slight grammar correction and addition in May\'s introductory speech:\n** Sneak Peek: "But just between you and I, what I\'m more interested in is traveling and seeing new places."\n** Regular version: "But just between you and me, what I\'m more interested in is traveling and seeing new places. There it is, Littleroot Town, up ahead!"\n* The only piece of music kept from the original is {{TRT}}\'s new motto theme.\n* While the original has no [[Who\'s That Pokémon?]] segment, 4Kids keeps it before replacing it with [[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]] in \'\'[[AG041|What You Seed is What You Get]]\'\'.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=9999FF|bordercolor=FF7777\n|zh_cmn={{tt|新的大地！新的冒險！！|A New Land!
