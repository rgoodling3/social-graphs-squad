It first aired in Japan on March 29, 2007 as part of a one-hour special with [[DP024]] and in the United States on September 1, 2007.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/10_25-oh-do-you-know-the-poffin-plan/-->\n<i>Dawn and Ash have reached Floaroma Town, the site of Dawn\'s next Pokémon Contest as well as a Poffin cooking class! Poffins are a type of Pokémon snack that Ash has never seen before, and it doesn\'t take much convincing for him and his friends to join the class. Making Poffin turns out to be harder than it looks, even when our heroes are being instructed by an expert like Forsythia. She\'s a Trainer with a flowery field full of Poffin ingredients and a shy Roserade that she met back when it was a lonely little Budew.\n\nWhen Team Rocket launches an automated raid on the berries Forsythia uses to make her Poffins, her Roserade puts on a scarf and steps up to defend its home. Whenever Roserade wears that scarf, its personality changes from shy to superhero—but once Meowth snatches the scarf, Roserade loses its nerve and is kidnapped by Team Rocket!\n\nForsythia calls to Roserade, reminding it that it\'s still strong even without the scarf. This gives Roserade the confidence it needs to deal Team Rocket another defeat and restore the damage caused by their rampage. Now it\'s back to cooking class, where Dawn develops her own special Poffin recipe. It looks like everyone has found some inspiration today, and Dawn should be on track to make a great showing at the upcoming Pokémon Contest!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the night, {{TRT}} sneaks into a garden and snacks on [[Berry|Berries]]. They notice an aroma that leads them to a building. On top of it, a caped figure jumps out and attacks with {{m|Magical Leaf}}, sending Team Rocket blasting off.\n\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrive in [[Floaroma Town]] as {{an|Brock}} notices all the flowers, {{an|Dawn}} running off to smell them. An elderly woman comes by and tells them about when Floaroma Town was once barren and without any kind of vegetation. Legend has it that a beautiful woman went atop the hill and expressed gratitude, which resulted in flowers growing exponentially. After telling the story, the woman leaves as Dawn notices a sign about a [[Poffin]] cooking class. Ash and Brock do not know what Poffins are, but Dawn explains that they are Pokémon snacks that improve [[Contest condition|condition]]s, recounting past experiences helping [[Johanna|her mother]]. Ash associates them with [[Hoenn]] [[Pokéblock]]s, but Brock mentions that they are made differently. Dawn convinces the others to take the class with her. \n\nThey go to [[Pick a Peck of Colors Flower Shop|the location]] as a {{p|Lotad}} and {{p|Roserade}} take care of the garden. Ash calls inside the house as Dawn notices that he is scaring a nearby Roserade. Ash checks his [[Pokédex]]. A woman steps out and asks if they are taking the cooking class, introducing herself as [[Forsythia]]. Brock is instantly attracted to her, but {{TP|Brock|Croagunk}} calms him with {{m|Poison Jab}} and drags him away. She brings them in and gives a quick demo on making Poffins generally. Dawn uses her [[Pokétch]] {{DL|Pokétch|Kitchen Timer}} App to help cook Poffins to the appropriate measure. Forsythia remarks on her solid knowledge, Dawn mentioning her experiences with her mother. Brock tries to talk about helping his family out, but Croagunk\'s presence is enough to calm him down. Dawn\'s timer beeps and she spreads the Poffin onto the mold platter. Meanwhile, Ash is struggling, almost spilling the batter but winding up burning it instead. Everyone finishes making Poffins at the same time, and all three of them bring out their {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. {{cat|Dawn\'s Pokémon}} tries her Poffins, but all three find them horrible. {{cat|Brock\'s Pokémon}} like his Poffin, but {{cat|Ash\'s Pokémon}} eats Forsythia\'s Poffins since his are burnt. He tries to eat them all himself, but he finds it obviously disgusting. Forsythia tries to reassure Ash as Dawn chases {{TP|Dawn|Pachirisu}}, sending one of Dawn\'s Poffins outside. It rolls up to {{MTR}} and the Pokémon eats it, instantly perking him up and making him happy. Dawn and Ash wash dishes as Forsythia explains to Dawn that each Pokémon has a Poffin preference and that there is a unique recipe for each. Copying her mother\'s recipe would be fine for her {{TP|Johanna|Glameow}}, but it is ill suited for other Pokémon. Meanwhile, Team Rocket decides to take the Poffins to get rich.\n\nForsythia prepares the group some tea as Roserade serves the plate, but quickly backs away scared. She mentions that Roserade has been very shy and nervous for as long as she remembers. She brings up the story of meeting Roserade, back as a {{p|Budew}}, in a [[Pokémon Center]]. Budew went with Forsythia when it saw the flowers she was holding. Forsythia gave Budew a red scarf to keep it warm, and it quickly [[Evolution|evolved]] to {{p|Roselia}} and finally Roserade.\n\nSuddenly, a giant explosion gets their attention as one of [[Team Rocket\'s mechas]] steals all the Berries and destroys the garden. Team Rocket recites their {{motto}}. [[Ash\'s Pikachu]] uses {{m|Thunderbolt}}, but it has no effect. [[Jessie\'s Dustox]] and [[James\'s Carnivine]] come out, but when Carnivine latches onto James, he sends out {{TP|James|Cacnea}}, but both latch onto him. Dustox uses {{m|Poison Sting}} as Brock\'s Croagunk uses his own Poison Sting to block it. [[Dawn\'s Piplup]] uses {{m|Bubble Beam}} and [[Ash\'s Turtwig]] uses {{m|Razor Leaf}}, but Cacnea\'s {{m|Pin Missile}} and Carnivine\'s {{m|Bullet Seed}} blocks the attacks. Roserade runs off and gets the red scarf, quickly exuding confidence. {{AP|Aipom}} attacks with {{m|Swift}}, but {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} uses {{m|Mirror Coat}} to block. {{TP|Dawn|Buneary}} uses {{m|Ice Beam}} but Cacnea uses {{m|Sandstorm}} to block. Team Rocket attempts to leave, but Roserade suddenly attacks with Magical Leaf. Team Rocket remembers last night and associates Roserade with the figure that attacked them. Forsythia recognizes the red scarf and wonders why Roserade is suddenly so aggressive. Lotad talks and Meowth translates that Roserade protects the orchard from bad guys and puts on the scarf to gain confidence.\n\nAsh sends Pikachu to use {{m|Quick Attack}} to rock the mecha, but Meowth deploys baskets to lock everyone but Forsythia down. Dustox uses {{m|Gust}} to pin Roserade, but it jumps off the roof. Meowth tries to take the scarf off Roserade, but Roserade resists. James sends {{TP|James|Mime Jr.}} to use {{m|Tickle}} on Roserade. It works and the scarf comes off, sending Roserade to the ground in fear. Team Rocket attempts to take off, taking Roserade with them. Forsythia runs to block them from leaving, as the others are helpless to help her. Forsythia convinces Roserade that it is powerful even without the scarf. Roserade snaps out of fear and breaks free of the grip, using {{m|Petal Dance}} to shear the tires and the baskets, freeing Ash and his friends. The group attacks with Piplup\'s Bubble Beam and Croagunk\'s Poison Sting. Pikachu\'s {{m|Iron Tail}} cuts the basket and releases the captured Berries. Roserade\'s Petal Dance sends Team Rocket blasting off a second time.\n\nRoserade uses {{m|Sunny Day}} and Lotad uses {{m|Water Gun}} to help repair the damaged garden, fresh plants sprouting in place, much like the legend of Floaroma Town. Dawn prepares another batch of Poffins as her Pokémon are reluctant to eat it. Buneary and Pachirisu try to get Piplup to taste first, but Piplup convinces them to all eat at once. This time, the Pokémon like the Poffins. Dawn learned from Forsythia that she could raise a strong yet beautiful Pokémon like Roserade. Dawn is now inspired to prepare for the next [[Pokémon Contest]].\n<!-- Written by rockersk08. -->\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:Dawn making Poffins.png|thumb|220px|Dawn making Poffins]]\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrive in [[Floaroma Town]].\n* {{an|Dawn}} learns how to make [[Poffin]]s.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* [[Forsythia]]\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Roserade}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]] (flashback)\n* [[Forsythia]]\n* Old woman\n* Orchard thieves (flashback)\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Piplup}} ({{OP|Dawn|Piplup}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Mime Jr.}} ({{OP|James|Mime Jr.}})\n* {{p|Aipom}} ({{OP|Ash|Aipom}})\n* {{p|Staravia}} ({{OP|Ash|Staravia}})\n* {{p|Turtwig}} ({{OP|Ash|Turtwig}})\n* {{p|Buneary}} ({{OP|Dawn|Buneary}})\n* {{p|Pachirisu}} ({{OP|Dawn|Pachirisu}})\n* {{p|Sudowoodo}} ({{OP|Brock|Sudowoodo}})\n* {{p|Croagunk}} ({{OP|Brock|Croagunk}})\n* {{p|Dustox}} ({{OP|Jessie|Dustox}})\n* {{p|Cacnea}} ({{OP|James|Cacnea}})\n* {{p|Carnivine}} ({{OP|James|Carnivine}})\n* {{p|Budew}} ([[Forsythia]]\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Roselia}} ([[Forsythia]]\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Roserade}} ([[Forsythia]]\'s; debut)\n* {{p|Lotad}} ([[Forsythia]]\'s)\n* {{p|Snorlax}} (flashback)\n* {{p|Ariados}} (flashback)\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:Kitchen Timer App anime.png|200px|thumb|The Kitchen Timer on {{an|Dawn}}\'s [[Pokétch]].]]\n* [[Professor Oak\'s Big Pokémon Encyclopedia]]: [[James\'s Cacnea]]\n** Pokémon senryū: サボネアは\u3000ふれるとチクチク\u3000トゲトゲよ \'\'Sabonea wa, fureru to chiku chiku, toge toge yo.\'\' "{{tt|Sabonea|Cacnea}}, prickly spikes, when it touches."\n* The English title of this episode is a reference to the line "Do you know {{wp|the Muffin Man}}?", a classic nursery rhyme.\n* This episode originally aired as a one-hour special with [[DP024]].\n* Music from \'\'[[M05|Pokémon Heroes: Latios & Latias]]\'\', \'\'[[M08|Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]\'\', and the {{TRT}} theme from the [[original series]] are used as background music.\n* {{an|Dawn}} uses the Kitchen Timer on her [[Pokétch]] when she was cooking [[Poffin]]s.\n* {{MTR}} tries a stray Poffin made from [[Johanna]]\'s recipe for {{TP|Johanna|Glameow}} and likes it.
