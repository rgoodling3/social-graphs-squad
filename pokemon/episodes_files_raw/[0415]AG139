May wants to catch it, but she sees that Drew is chasing it too! Thanks to Extreme Speed, Arcanine easily escapes. May catches up to it while it\'s eating and sends out Combusken, but Arcanine outruns her Pokémon. So Ash and his friends stop to ask a woodsman about Arcanine, and he points them to locations where it sometimes appears—but he also told Drew the same information about an hour ago.\n\nMeanwhile, Team Rocket has been fired from the bakery for eating the merchandise, and a combination of Wobbuffet and hunger leads them to a Pecha grove. Ash and his friends are waiting in the grove; when Arcanine shows up, they send it towards May and Squirtle. Arcanine uses Roar on Squirtle, and May sends out Munchlax to use Metronome. Metronome gives Munchlax Extreme Speed, speed it uses to eat all the Pecha berries. By the time Team Rocket arrives, the trees have been picked clean! They do spot Arcanine, however, and decide to nab it for the boss.\n\nMay and Drew again run into each other on a high ledge and see Arcanine run off again. Irate, May challenges Drew to see who gets Arcanine, and Drew\'s Flygon quickly defeats May\'s Squirtle. Both Coordinators chase after Arcanine anyway, only to find it feeding Pecha berries to its young Growlithe.\n\nTeam Rocket kidnaps Arcanine and the Growlithe, but Drew and May team up to free them and defeat Team Rocket. May and Drew then decide not to break up Arcanine\'s family, and they let it go on its way. Drew goes on his way too, but not before he tells May to try the Pokémon Contest in Saffron City. Excited, our heroes set their sights on their next destination!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nOn route to the [[Battle Arena]], the group have stopped off at a particularly popular [[Kanto]] bakery at {{an|May}}\'s request. Suddenly, an {{p|Arcanine}} comes bounding down the road directly towards the gathered crowd. The Arcanine leaps over everyone and continues running into the distance; May watches it in amazement and says that she wants to catch it. Just then, a voice calls out to Arcanine. Everyone looks to see [[Drew]] and his {{p|Flygon}} chasing it. He orders Flygon to use {{m|Flamethrower}}, though Arcanine evades and responds back with a {{m|Heat Wave}} attack. Arcanine then sprints into {{m|Extreme Speed}} to get away, much to Drew’s annoyance. May is curious at to why Drew is in Kanto, and he remarks that he hopes to win the [[Kanto Grand Festival]] before showing off his newest [[Ribbon]]. Drew is unsurprised by May’s lack of progress and soon leaves with his Flygon to continue pursuing the Arcanine. The group also leaves, May wanting to catch Arcanine to show Drew up. {{TRT}}, currently working at the bakery, pause to watch the [[twerp]]s leave, but they are ordered back to work by their particularly furious boss.\n\nMeanwhile, {{TP|Brock|Mudkip}} leads the group directly to Arcanine as it picking [[Pecha Berry|Pecha Berries]] and storing them for later. Arcanine starts to leave, so May sends out {{TP|May|Combusken}} to get it. Combusken starts to catch up, but Arcanine uses Extreme Speed to flee. {{an|Brock}} suggests asking someone as they come to an [[old woodsman]]\'s house. The man admits that a young boy and his Flygon were also curious about the Arcanine, and he also shares his first-hand information on the elusive Arcanine with the group. He explains that the Arcanine never came down from the mountains until recently and that it goes to Pecha Trees and a local spring. Since all Pokémon have to drink sometime, the group heads to the spring and hides in the bushes nearby. May says that she will use {{TP|May|Squirtle}} to battle it, Ash\'s stomach rumbles. Saying that it must be time for lunch, but May yells that he\'ll never eat lunch again if he\'s not quiet. Brock quickly whips up a meal using some vegetables from the woodsman. A rustle in the bushes gets everyone\'s attention, and they look over at the spring to see Arcanine drinking some water. It hears them and runs off quickly.\n\nAfter being fired from their bakery jobs for eating a wedding cake, Team Rocket walks through the forest complaining of hunger. {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} suddenly appears with four Pecha Berries in its arms. [[James]] thinks that he\'s got one for all of them, but Wobbuffet eats them all. [[Jessie]] shakes her Pokémon and tells it to give them the location of the Pecha Trees.\n\nMeanwhile, Ash and his friends have stumbled onto the Pecha Trees. Everyone gathers in a circle as Brock draws out a map in the dirt. He points out that the east and west sides of the area are steep cliffs so the Arcanine must\'ve come from north or south. He has May and Max go to the north end while he and Ash will wait at the south end, thinking they can divert the Arcanine to May if it comes their way. {{AP|Corphish}}, Mudkip, and Squirtle come out of their {{i|Poké Ball}}s ready for battle. Arcanine soon comes in from the south, so Corphish attempts a {{m|Bubble Beam}}, though the attack misses its target. Next, Brock orders a {{m|Water Gun}} from Mudkip, leading Arcanine to flee up north. As May gets ready for Arcanine, she discovers that Squirtle is sleeping. She wakes it up and tells it to get ready. It stands to attention as Arcanine approaches. Arcanine uses {{m|Roar}} and Squirtle returns to its Poké Ball. Following on Max’s suggestion, May calls out {{TP|May|Munchlax}} for a {{m|Metronome}}. Arcanine uses Extreme Speed to get away as Munchlax starts waving its hands. Munchlax’s Metronome turns into an Extreme Speed attack, and it quickly matches Arcanine’s speed. May tells it to jump on top, but Munchlax ignores orders, and instead starts gathering Pecha Berries at a blinding pace. Team Rocket later arrive at the Pecha Tree grove, scaling down a mountain to reach it. However, the trees are completely fruitless thanks to Munchlax’s bingeing. As Jessie prepares to reprimand Wobbuffet for leading them astray, the Arcanine dashes by, so the trio instantly set their sights on delivering it to {{an|Giovanni}}.\n\nAsh and the others are now trying their last idea, going to the cliffs. They hide behind a rock, with Squirtle out, as Arcanine walks up the path to a ledge. May jumps out with Squirtle and corners Arcanine. But just when she thinks she\'s got it, Drew jumps in with Flygon. Arcanine jumps past the two and up a cliff. May and Drew argue for a bit, though decide to settles who gets Arcanine in a battle. Brock judges the match and tells them to begin. May orders Squirtle to use {{m|Tackle}}, which Flygon dodges by flying. Flygon then uses a {{m|Steel Wing}} attack. Squirtle tries to use {{m|Bubble}} to block, but Flygon\'s Steel Wing hits and Squirtle begins to cry again. May picks it up as Drew walks towards the cliff where Arcanine went. Everyone climbs up to see that it\'s gone. But then they notice it up on a higher ledge and see that Arcanine is feeding three {{p|Growlithe}} babies. \n\nSuddenly Team Rocket, in their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|balloon]], net the Growlithe for themselves and capture Arcanine as it tries to intervene. Team Rocket rejoice for a moment, but are sent back to the ground by Flygon\'s Steel Wing. Drew and the group rush to the crash site. Ash and Brock start to take out their Poké Balls, but May decides that she and Drew can take care of Team Rocket. Flygon uses Steel Wing to break the nets and free the captives. James sends out {{TP|James|Cacnea}} and gets a needle-filled hug, before telling it to attack. Cacnea releases a {{m|Pin Missile}}, but Squirtle blocks with Bubble. Jessie sends in {{TP|Jessie|Dustox}} and orders a {{m|Poison Sting}}, though Flygon counters with {{m|Flamethrower}}. As Cacnea whips up a {{m|Sandstorm}}, Flygon blocks Squirtle from getting hit. Squirtle hops onto Flygon, and the pair soar towards their foe. Squirtle soon jumps off and smashes Dustox in a {{m|Tackle}} while Cacnea gets a Steel Wing from Flygon. May and Drew order Water Gun and Flamethrower respectively, sending Team Rocket blasting off. Seeing as Arcanine is a parent, May decides not to capture Arcanine, and Drew also concedes.\n\nAs the sun sets into the mountains, Drew tells May that she should enter the [[Saffron City]] [[Pokémon Contest]]. He explains that he won’t be entering that Contest as he hopes to get a new Pokémon to strengthen his team. As Drew leaves, Max checks the [[PokéNav]] and announces that Saffron City is close by, and conveniently on the way to the Battle Arena. Ash says that they\'ll head for Saffron City first, so they head out.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} meet up with [[Drew]] again.\n* Drew is revealed to have earned his first [[Kanto]] [[Ribbon]].\n* {{an|May}} attempts to {{pkmn2|caught|catch}} an {{p|Arcanine}}, but decides against it later.\n* [[May\'s Squirtle]] is revealed to know {{m|Tackle}} and {{m|Water Gun}}.\n* May learns that a [[Pokémon Contest]] will be held in [[Saffron City]].\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{an|Giovanni}} ([[Boss fantasy|fantasy]])\n* [[Drew]]\n* [[Old woodsman]]\n* Team Rocket\'s employer\n* Cake shop customers\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:PTC AG139.png|thumb|200px|Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]\n[[Pokémon Trainer\'s Choice]]: {{p|Mightyena}}\n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Chimecho}} ({{OP|James|Chimecho}})\n* {{p|Corphish}} ({{OP|Ash|Corphish}})\n* {{p|Combusken}} ({{OP|May|Combusken}})\n* {{p|Squirtle}} ({{OP|May|Squirtle}})\n* {{p|Munchlax}} ({{OP|May|Munchlax}})\n* {{p|Mudkip}} ({{OP|Brock|Mudkip}})\n* {{p|Dustox}} ({{OP|Jessie|Dustox}})\n* {{p|Cacnea}} ({{OP|James|Cacnea}})\n* {{p|Flygon}} ([[Drew]]\'s)\n* {{p|Growlithe}} (×3)\n* {{p|Arcanine}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* The owner of the cake shop is very similar to, if not the same man who ran the [[Ever Grande Conference]] concession stands.\n* [[May\'s Combusken]]\'s Japanese voice actress in this episode was [[Rikako Aikawa]], who was filling in for [[Chinami Nishimura]].\n* This is the last episode to have [[Pete Zarustica]] voice [[Drew]] and [[Maddie Blaustein]] voice [[Ash\'s Corphish]].\n* The English dub title is a reference to the idiom "\'\'On cloud nine\'\'".\n** It could also be a reference to the [[Ability]] {{a|Cloud Nine}}.\n\n===Errors===\n* When {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} pops up after {{TRT}} decides to catch {{p|Arcanine}} for {{an|Giovanni}}, the sound of it coming out of its Poké Ball can be heard even though it was already out.\n* In the scene where Team Rocket\'s balloon crashes, Arcanine is in the net with its {{p|Growlithe}}.
