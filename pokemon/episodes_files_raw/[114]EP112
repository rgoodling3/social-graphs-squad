Enter {{tt|Kairyu|Dragonite}}!!\'\') is the 112th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on September 9, 1999 and in the United States on September 23, 2000.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/03_07-enter-the-dragonite/-->\n<i>As if a gym battle with a Dragonite isn\'t challenge enough for one day, Team Rocket secretly surveys the weakened state of Ash\'s battling Pokémon and plots to turn the situation to their advantage.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nIt is revealed that, after the explosion from their {{m|Ice Beam}} and {{m|Night Shade}} attacks, both {{AP|Lapras}} and {{p|Gengar}} faint. {{Ash}} and {{OBP|Drake|Orange League}} recall their Pokémon, and with three of Drake\'s defeated, the field changes. The announcer remarks how Ash is the first {{pkmn|Trainer}} to knock out three of Drake\'s Pokémon in a row. In the stands, {{TRT}} decides to capture [[Drake\'s Dragonite]] when Ash weakens it.\n\nAfter the field changes into a desert field, Drake calls out his {{p|Venusaur}} and Ash uses {{AP|Tauros}} again. Ash tries to start things off with {{m|Fissure}}, but it doesn\'t work because the sand on the field absorbs the attack. Drake tells Venusaur to use {{m|Solar Beam}}. Hoping to cause damage before the Solar Beam is charged, Ash tells Tauros to use {{m|Take Down}}, but the sandy field doesn\'t allow it to gain any traction. In a last-ditch effort, Ash has Tauros send Venusaur flying. Venusaur is sent soaring into the air, but it manages to turn itself in midair and releases its Solar Beam directly on Tauros. Unexpectedly, Tauros isn\'t defeated and the Solar Beam actually freed him from the sand. Venusaur then launches a barrage of {{m|Vine Whip}}s, a few of which hit Tauros. Then, Tauros dodges the rest and hits Venusaur with a powerful {{m|Take Down}}, defeating it.\n\nDrake recalls Venusaur and sends out {{p|Electabuzz}}. Ash decides to let Tauros rest and calls out {{AP|Bulbasaur}}. Drake tells Electabuzz to use {{m|Thunder Shock}}, but Bulbasaur\'s [[type]] advantage leaves it unfazed and it counters with a {{m|Razor Leaf}}. Electabuzz is hit by a few of the leaves, but then deflects with {{m|Thunderbolt}}. Drake tells Electabuzz to use {{m|Thunder Punch}}, and Ash has Bulbasaur use {{m|Tackle}}. Bulbasaur lands its attack, but is soon defeated by Electabuzz\'s Thunder Punch. Ash promptly sends out {{AP|Charizard}}. Electabuzz uses a combination of Thunder Punch and {{m|Thunder}}, but Charizard stops it with {{m|Fire Spin}}{{tt|*|incorrectly referred as {{m|Ember}} in the dub}}. Electabuzz then attempts to use Thunderbolt, but Charizard grabs it and uses {{m|Seismic Toss}}, defeating it. With only one Pokémon left, Drake removes the {{i|Poké Ball}} from his necklace and sends out Dragonite.\n\nCharizard uses {{m|Flamethrower}}, but Dragonite counters with {{m|Water Gun}}, which negates the attack and strikes Charizard with the [[super-effective]] move. Charizard then attempts to {{m|Fly}} upward, and Dragonite quickly follows. Dragonite uses {{m|Ice Beam}}, hitting Charizard\'s wing and sending into a free-fall. Fortunately, Charizard recovers and goes in for a Seismic Toss, but Dragonite escapes and turns the move around by grabbing Charizard by the neck. Dragonite then uses {{m|Slam}} and Charizard is sent crashing into the ground. Though weakened considerably, Charizard gets back on its feet. Ash orders Charizard to use {{m|Dragon Rage}}, and Drake commands Dragonite to do the same. Both attacks collide, and the two Pokémon are sent flying back. While Dragonite is left fazed, the attack causes Charizard to faint. Ash recalls Charizard, thanking it for still wearing Dragonite down.\n\nKnowing none of his Pokémon are on the same [[level]] as Dragonite, Ash decides they will have to work together to it take out. He sends out Squirtle, who is still tired from its [[EP111|earlier battle]] with Drake\'s {{p|Onix}}. Squirtle starts off with {{m|Hydro Pump}}, but it is knocked to the ground by Dragonite\'s {{m|Water Gun}}. It then uses {{m|Thunderbolt}}, but Squirtle {{m|Withdraw}}s in time to escape the majority of the damage. Drake commands a {{m|Body Slam}}, and Dragonite flies into the air and starts to descend. Ash tells Squirtle to use {{m|Bubble Beam}}, and the attack hits dead on, causing the Body Slam to fail; upon landing, Dragonite slams its tail into Squirtle hard, knocking it out. Despite Ash\'s loss, Dragonite continues to lose energy.\n\nSeizing this chance, Team Rocket appears in their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|balloon]] and tosses a net onto Dragonite. After saying their {{motto}}, the trio thanks Ash for assisting them with their scheme. As Drake grows furious with Team Rocket, Dragonite breaks the net with its large wings and pops Team Rocket\'s balloon with {{m|Skull Bash}}, sending them blasting off again.\n\nWith Team Rocket out of the way, the battle continues. Ash decides to send out Tauros against Dragonite, but Tauros is still tired from his fight with Venusaur. Drake commands a Fly, followed by a Body Slam. Ash suddenly gets an idea and tells Tauros to take the hit, surprising Drake. The Body Slam hits, but doesn\'t have the intended effect. Using the sand on the battlefield to absorb the impact, Tauros has caught Dragonite in his horns. Tauros then throws Dragonite into the air and it lands hard on the ground. Dragonite gets up and hits Tauros with {{m|Thunder}}, knocking the exhausted Pokémon out.\n\nAsh summons Pikachu despite his early squabble with Drake\'s Ditto. Pikachu starts off with {{m|Agility}}, but is knocked into the air by Dragonite\'s tail. Dragonite gets ready to use {{m|Hyper Beam}}, but Pikachu uses his tail as a spring board to dodge the attack. Dragonite is unable to move due to the aftereffects of Hyper Beam, allowing Pikachu to land on Dragonite\'s head. Dragonite tries to shake him off, but Pikachu holds on to its antennae, and the battles with Ash\'s other Pokémon have left it quite exhausted. At Ash\'s command, Pikachu lands a direct hit with Thunder. Dragonite and Pikachu are left exhausted and, after a staring contest, Dragonite falls to the ground, defeated.\n\nAsh makes his way over to the podium with his Pokémon behind him. Drake gives Ash the coveted Orange League [[Winner\'s Trophy]] and congratulates him on the win. Along with Ash receiving the trophy, Ash, Pikachu, Squirtle, Tauros, Lapras, Bulbasaur, and Charizard are given the honor of being inducted into the [[Palace of Victory|Orange League Hall of Fame]], with their [[footprint]]s and Ash\'s hand-print immortalized in concrete, and a group photo taken to commemorate the victory. Ash is left ecstatic by this and hopes to tell {{an|Brock}} about his win.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

Moments later Dragonite is shown face up being held by Tauros.\n* When Ash sends out Charizard, the announcer says that it is the only fully evolved Pokémon on Ash\'s team. This is false, as Tauros and Lapras, who do not evolve, are technically fully evolved.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[Pikachu\'s Jukebox]]: {{OBP|Viridian City|song}}\n* Charizard\'s {{m|Fire Spin}} is referred to as {{m|Ember}} in the dub.\n* Squirtle\'s {{m|Bubble Beam}} is referred to as {{m|Bubble}} in the dub.\n* When Ash interrupts Team Rocket\'s {{motto}}, the music originally cuts out for a second. In the dub, the music isn\'t interrupted.\n* In the original version, Drake tells Dragonite to use {{m|Skull Bash}} to send Team Rocket blasting off. In the dub, he just says, "You know what to do."\n* In the original Japanese version, when Dragonite attacks Tauros, Drake tells it to use {{m|Agility}} and Body Slam. In the dub, Drake only tells Dragonite to use the latter move.\n* The announcer mistakenly refers to Dragonite as a [[Legendary Pokémon]].\n* Just before the "To Be Continued" shot at the end of the episode, an image of Ash posing with the [[Winner\'s Trophy]] appears in the middle of the screen. In the Japanese version, this image shrinks away when Ash finishes talking and the "To Be Continued" text appears on the screen, but in the dub, it does not. However, the sound effect of the image shrinking away can still be heard in the dub.\n<gallery>\nFile:EP112 To Be Continued Original.png|"To Be Continued" in the original Japanese version\nFile:EP112 To Be Continued Dub.png|"To Be Continued" in the English dub\n</gallery>\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FFDDAA|bordercolor=FFBB55\n|bg={{tt|Завръщането на Драгонайт|Return of Dragonite}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|最終戰鬥，快龍登場！|Final Battle, Enter Dragonite!}}\n|cs={{tt|Dragonite přichází|Dragonite is coming}}\n|nl={{tt|De Komst van de Dragonite|The Arrival of Dragonite}}\n|de={{tt|In der Höhle des Drachen|Inside the cave of the dragon}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Le Trophée du Vainqueur|The Winner\'s Trophy}}\n|he=הופעתו של דרגונייט {{tt|\'\'Hofahato shel Dragonite\'\'|Dragonite\'s Appearance}}\n|hu={{tt|Harc Dragonite-tal|Battle With Dragonite}}\n|it={{tt|Una grande vittoria|A great victory}}{{tt|*|Original 2000 dub}} <br> {{tt|Un finale a sorpresa|A surprise ending}}{{tt|*|2014 K2 TV dub}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Que Venha o Dragonite|Then Come the Dragonite}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Entra o Dragonite|Dragonite Enters}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Entra Dragonite!|Dragonite enters!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Adelante Dragonite|Go forward Dragonite}}\n|pl={{tt|Wejście Dragonite\'a|Enter of Dragonite}}\n|ro={{tt|Intră în Scena Dragonite|Enter the Dragonite Scene}}\n|hi=Dragonite पोकेमोन {{tt|\'\'Dragonite Pokemon\'\'|The Pokémon Dragonite}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext\n|prevcode=EP111\n|prevtitle=Hello, Pummelo!\n|nextcode=EP113\n|nexttitle=Viva Las Lapras\n|series=Original series\n|colorscheme=Orange}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0112}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|112]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Atsuhiro Tomioka]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Toshiaki Suzuki]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Shigeru Ōmachi]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Yūsaku Takeda]]\n[[Category:Pokémon League episodes]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Ash]]\n\n[[de:In der Höhle des Drachen]]\n[[es:EP114]]\n[[fr:EP112]]\n[[it:EP112]]\n[[ja:無印編第112話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第113集]]'}
