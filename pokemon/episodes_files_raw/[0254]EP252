It was first broadcast in Japan on June 13, 2002 and in the United States on June 7, 2003. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/05_42-fangs-for-nothing/-->\n<i>No sooner has Ash begun what he hopes will be his final gym battle in the Johto League than Team Rocket once again throws a wrench into his plans, making off with the Dragon Fang, an invaluable heirloom long held by the Blackthorn Gym. Ash and friends, along with the gym leader, give chase, but in their flight, Team Rocket leads them deep into a secretive area rarely visited by anyone but the Dragon Pokémon that dwell there. Perhaps angered by these uninvited guests, a large beast flies directly at Ash and friends as soon as they enter this area. Uncertain whether this shape be friend or foe, our heroes raise their guard and wait as it grows closer... and looms larger still.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Kaburagi]] takes his position as the [[Battle judge]], and announces that {{Ash}} will face {{ci|Blackthorn}} [[Gym Leader]] [[Clair]] in a three-on-three {{pkmn|battle}}. Clair leads with {{p|Kingdra}}, which Ash responds with {{AP|Pikachu}}. Pikachu tries to {{m|Thunderbolt}} Kingdra, and despite a direct hit, Kingdra easily shakes the attack off. This puzzles {{an|Misty}} and {{an|Brock}}. Kingdra responds with {{m|Twister}}, which catches Pikachu. However, Pikachu manages to recover, and launches a {{m|Thunder}} attack, only for Kingdra to shake it off as well. Ash is also confused by why Kingdra is easily repelling Pikachu\'s attacks, to which Clair replies that, though Kingdra is evolved from a {{p|Seadra}}, a {{t|Water}} type, upon evolution it gains the {{t|Dragon}} type as well. Kingdra continues the battle with {{m|Hydro Pump}}, which Pikachu returns fire with Thunderbolt.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Jessie]] is lamenting the loss of {{p|Dratini}}, but is cheered up by the prospect of food. As Jessie is planning her revenge against Clair, the food meant to cheer her up is stolen from right under them. Though {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} notices this, and the others blame instantly blame him for eating the food after hearing a similar voice, which is actually a hidden {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Wynaut}}). However, they do manage to formulate a plan to steal the [[Dragon Fang]].\n\nBack at the [[Gym]], Ash decides to switch out Pikachu after a {{m|Quick Attack}} also fails to faze Kingdra. Sending in {{AP|Noctowl}} instead, Ash tries to use its {{t|Psychic}} abilities to try and land a blow against Kingdra. Elsewhere, {{TRT}} manages to sneak in and steal the Dragon Fang from the Gym\'s treasure room without setting off its infrared alarms thanks to James’s Handy-Andy mechanical hand. However, an overzealous Wobbuffet manages to knock the group over, which subsequently breaks one of the sensor beams. As Ash’s match wages on, Noctowl temporarily immobilizes Kingdra with a {{m|Confusion}} attack. However, Kingdra aims a Hydro Pump at the wall to break the attack. Noctowl\'s {{m|Hypnosis}} also misses its mark thanks to Kingdra\'s {{m|Agility}}, and Kingdra lands a Hydro Pump on Noctowl, about to knock it out just as the burglar alarm sounded.\n\nEveryone abandons the battle and rushes outside to see Team Rocket fleeing the crime scene with the Dragon Fang in hand. The Rocket trio commandeers a nearby boat and speeds off into the [[Dragon\'s Den]], a cave filled with a confusing network of tunnel in the middle of the water. Clair and the others call out a flotilla of Pokémon and swim after the thieves. Her {{TP|Clair|Dragonair}}\'s light and ability to sense changes in water currents helps them to track Team Rocket, who find themselves in the [[Dragon Holy Land]]. The trio are saved from falling down from the waterfall into the Holy Land by a {{p|Dragonite}}, who Team Rocket convinces that they are trying to protect the Dragon Fang from Clair and the others. As Ash and his friends also manage to reach the Holy Land, they split up to look for Team Rocket. Upon arrival, the Dragonite fires a {{m|Hyper Beam}} as a warning shot at the group. Ash and his friends are surprised by the odd partnership. Dragonite goes onto pick the Rocket trio up and flies off with them. Kaburagi explains that the Dragonite had once belonged to the first {{OBP|Gym Leader|EP253}} of Blackthorn City, and had never felt the same since her Trainer had passed away. However, their thoughts are disturbed by a roar coming from [[Ash\'s Charizard|a Pokémon]] flying towards them.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} begins his [[Gym]] {{pkmn|battle}} against [[Clair]], but it is interrupted due to {{TRT}} trying to steal the [[Dragon Fang]].\n* A {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Wynaut}} begins to follow Team Rocket.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Wynaut}} ({{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Wynaut|anime}})\n\n=====TV episode debuts=====\n======English dub debuts======\n* {{p|Furret}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n[[File:PMTV EP252.png|thumb|200px|right|{{tt|Pocket Monster TV|Who\'s That Pokémon}}]]\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Clair]]\n* [[Kaburagi]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP EP252.png|thumb|200px|right|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Octillery}} \'\'(US and international)\'\', {{p|Dragonair}} \'\'(Japan)\'\'\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Togepi}} ({{OP|Misty|Togepi}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Charizard}} ({{OP|Ash|Charizard}}; shadowed)\n* {{p|Totodile}} ({{OP|Ash|Totodile}})\n* {{p|Noctowl}} ({{OP|Ash|Noctowl}}; {{Shiny}})\n* {{p|Staryu}} ({{OP|Misty|Staryu}})\n* {{p|Politoed}} ({{OP|Misty|Politoed}})\n* {{p|Kingdra}} ([[Clair]]\'s)\n* {{p|Dragonair}} ({{OP|Clair|Dragonair}})\n* {{p|Wynaut}} ({{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Wynaut|anime}})\n* {{p|Dragonite}} ({{DL|Clair|Dragonite|anime}})\n* {{p|Rattata}}\n* {{p|Bellossom}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Hoppip}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Skiploom}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Jumpluff}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Butterfree}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Sentret}}\n* {{p|Furret}}\n* {{p|Sunflora}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Venonat}}\n* {{p|Oddish}} (multiple)\n* {{p|Nidoran♀}}\n* {{p|Nidoran♂}}\n* {{p|Stantler}}\n* {{p|Bellsprout}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* This episode marks the English dub debut of {{p|Furret}} in the {{pkmn|anime}}, as [[EP250|the episode]] it already debuted in never got dubbed in English and was [[Banned episodes|banned]] almost internationally, including in {{pmin|the United States|North America}}, due to the [[Pokémon controversy|controversial]] appearance of {{p|Jynx|another Pokémon}}.\n* The English title to this episode is a pun on the phrase "thanks for nothing".\n* Music from \'\'[[M01|Mewtwo Strikes Back]]\'\' and \'\'[[M02|The Power of One]]\'\' can be heard.\n* This episode is featured on the \'\'Volume 8: Dragon\'\' copy of [[Pokémon Elements]].\n* After Brock grabs onto Staryu, he remarks sarcastically, "\'\'This\'\' is a whole new experience."
