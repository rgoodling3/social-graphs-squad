It first aired in Japan on July 7, 2019 and in the United States on November 9, 2019.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/22_37-battle-royal-151/-->\n<i>The Alola Pokémon League is underway, and it promises to be full of action, drama, and surprises! The qualifying round is a Battle Royal competition among 151 different Trainers, and only the top 16 will make it to the next stage! A free-for-all ensues, with our heroes battling against and alongside friendly rivals like Pikala and Hiroki as well as returning foes like Viren’s cronies and Plumeria from Team Skull. When the dizzying action finally winds down, the entire Pokémon School class, Hau, Gladion, and even a disguised Team Rocket are among those left standing! Now, the question is: who will make it all the way to the top?</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashcl}} walk onto the [[Manalo Stadium]] battlefield, joining all of the other [[Alola League]] participants. Among the contestants are [[Oluolu]], [[Master fisherman]], [[Mina]], [[Kahili]], and [[Acerola]], the last of which surprises the group with her presence. [[Jessie]] and [[James]] are in [[List of Team Rocket\'s disguises|disguises]], planning to get through the preliminary round by avoiding the battles at all costs. The one most favored to win, [[Ilima]], makes his way into the stadium, where he is greeted by his many fans, much to the annoyance of [[Tupp]]. [[Plumeria]] orders all of the {{tc|Team Skull Grunt}}s to not get in the way of [[Guzma]]\'s victory.\n \n{{an|Professor Kukui}} greets the League participants and crowd and declares the [[Manalo Conference]] to be open. [[Caster]] takes over, declaring his role as the announcer. He introduces the Manalo Conference\'s official judges, which are all four [[Island Kahuna]]s: [[Olivia]], [[Hala]], [[Hapu]], and [[Nanu]]. Caster then explains that 151 contestants will be competing for the title of Alola {{pkmn|Champion}}. They will be whittled down to the Top 16 in a series of [[Battle Royal]]-style matches. Soon, the participants get into their starting positions, spanning the entire perimeter of the battlefield. The Island Kahunas raise their hands and a countdown begins, with all of the {{pkmn|Trainer}}s calling out their respective Pokémon partners.\n\nThe countdown reaches zero and the preliminary round officially begins, kicking off the Manalo Conference. [[Hiroki]] rushes out with his {{p|Mudbray}}, ordering any challengers to come at him. However, he and Mudbray are immediately struck by a combination attack, making him the first to be knocked out of the competition. {{AP|Pikachu}} lands an {{m|Iron Tail}} on a {{p|Sudowoodo}}\'s forehead, which causes it to immediately faint. As Ash cheers for his early victory, Kiawe orders him to pay attention to the fast-approaching {{p|Poliwrath}}. Pikachu launches an {{m|Electroweb}} attack to defeat Poliwrath, also knocking out a nearby {{p|Araquanid}} in the process. Meanwhile, [[Kiawe\'s Turtonator]] takes a direct {{m|Flamethrower}} from a {{p|Salamence}}, before striking it away with a {{m|Dragon Tail}}. Lillie joins the scuffle, and has [[Snowy]] {{status|frozen|freeze}} Salamence with a {{m|Powder Snow}}, taking the {{t|Dragon}} type out of the fight. [[Sandy]] and {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Shaymin}} quickly defeat three opponents, with Lana and Mallow congratulating them. Sophocles has {{TP|Sophocles|Togedemaru}} bowl a {{p|Shiinotic}} out the way with {{m|Zing Zap}}. A {{p|Politoed}} leaps and grabs Togedemaru, but it is quickly defeated by Togedemaru\'s newly learned {{m|Spiky Shield}}. From a sky-box, [[Wicke]] sees {{an|Faba}} defeating a competitor\'s {{p|Boldore}} with his {{p|Alakazam}}.\n\nAs 79 participants remain, Ash and Pikachu face off against an intimidating {{p|Gyarados}}. As Ash prepares to call out an attack, a {{p|Skarmory}} swoops in and uses {{m|Metal Claw}} on Gyarados. Pikachu then uses the opportunity to leap onto Gyarados and deliver a direct {{m|Thunderbolt}}, knocking both Skarmory and Gyarados out with one hit. Kiawe orders Turtonator to keep an {{alo|Sandslash}} at bay with a Flamethrower, though it continues to spin closer. Kiawe switches tactics and calls for Turtonator to use {{m|Shell Trap}}. The maneuver catches Sandslash off-guard as its claws directly touch Turtonator\'s spiny shell, setting off the Shell Trap and defeating the [[Pokémon category|Mouse Pokémon]]. A tense standoff between a {{p|Magikarp}} and a {{p|Pyukumuku}} abruptly ends due to an {{m|Electro Ball}} from [[Pikarla]]\'s {{p|Pikachu}}, Bolt. However, Pikarla\'s victory is short-lived, as [[Jessie\'s Mimikyu]] knocks Bolt out with a {{m|Shadow Ball}}. Mimikyu then runs for another Trainer\'s Pikachu, leaving Jessie and James overwhelmed.\n\nAs 65 participants remain, a {{p|Talonflame}} swoops towards {{an|Gladion}} and his {{TP|Gladion|Silvally}}, though they evade the attack. Gladion throws a [[Rock Memory]] to Silvally, {{a|RKS System|transforming it}} into a {{t|Rock}} Pokémon. After Talonflame is quickly taken down by a super-effective {{m|Multi-Attack}}, Gladion and Silvally spot Ash and Pikachu sitting on the battlefield. The pair exchange stares before Gladion warns Ash of an incoming attacker, a {{p|Primeape}}, while a {{p|Clawitzer}} leaps up behind Silvally. Pikachu leaps into action, using Thunderbolt to defeat the Clawitzer as Silvally lands a {{m|Crush Claw}} on Primeape, taking it down. Gladion tells Ash to not lose in the preliminaries, and Ash offers him the same advice. The two [[rival]]s go their separate ways as they rush back into the melee.\n\nKiawe goes up against [[Mad Magmar]] and [[Mr. Electric]] as [[Viren]], sitting in the stands nearby, orders his minions to teach him a lesson. Turtonator starts off with a Flamethrower, though the attack fails to do any damage to {{p|Magmortar}}. Mr. Electric orders his {{p|Electivire}} to use {{m|Thunder Punch}}. Turtonator, however, uses {{m|Shell Smash}} and easily avoids the attack with its now-boosted {{stat|Speed}}, before defeating both Magmortar and Electivire with a single Dragon Tail. Viren is in shock as Olivia officially declares the pair unable to continue.\n\nWith 34 Trainers now remaining, the crowd\'s attention turns to Ilima, who has his {{p|Eevee}} unleash an overwhelming {{m|Last Resort}} attack, which defeats all of the Team Skull Grunts with one hit. Ilima is then immediately faced by Plumeria, who tells her {{p|Salazzle}} to use {{m|Sludge Wave}}. Ilima has Eevee use {{m|Quick Attack}} to leap over the attack and to Salazzle\'s position. Salazzle lashes Eevee with {{m|Dragon Claw}} and follows up with {{m|Dragon Pulse}}. While Eevee manages to evade much of the Dragon Pulse, one of its back legs is injured. Despite this, Eevee performs another Quick Attack to get away from another Dragon Pulse. With enough distance, Ilima has Eevee use {{m|Swift}}, striking Salazzle out of the competition. Plumeria, however, is not disappointed by her effort, admitting that she already did what she came to do. Eevee limps over to Ilima, its condition instantly concerning him.\n\nLater, Kukui watches from the grandstand as Guzma continues defeating opponents, concerned that the Team Skull leader\'s clearance of the preliminaries may jeopardize the Alola League\'s future. With seventeen contestants remaining, only one more Trainer has to be eliminated before the round can mark its end. Jessie\'s Mimikyu confronts Ash\'s Pikachu, who uses Electroweb to block its oncoming Shadow Ball, leading to an explosion. James yells at Jessie to abandon the battle so they can both get into the next round. At that moment, Kiawe\'s Turtonator defeats another Trainer\'s {{p|Metagross}} with an {{m|Inferno Overdrive}}, concluding the preliminary round. Mimikyu, however, doesn\'t care and continues to attack, forcing Jessie to [[recall]] it back into its [[Luxury Ball]]. Jessie runs over to James, relieved to have just qualified for the next round. All of the qualifying participants are soon revealed, including Ash, all of his classmates, Jessie and James, Mina, Acerola, Ilima, Gladion, Faba, [[Samson Oak]], Guzma, and [[Hau]].\n\nOvernight, the group stops off at the League [[Pokémon Center]] to have their Pokémon healed up from the day\'s intense matches by the gathered [[Nurse Joy]]s of [[Alola]]. Ilima urges his injured Eevee to take it easy, though it seems disappointed that it still needs to recover. Shortly after, Caster appears on the Pokémon Center [[television]] screen to announce the next round\'s pairings. Ash and Faba are revealed to be the first pair, making Ash happy to be the first one to battle, while Faba starts thinking about plans to use against Ash. The next pair is revealed to be Ilima versus Guzma, to which the [[Team Skull]] Boss responds with a satisfying smirk. The third match is Hau versus Samson Oak, and Hau is determined to win. The fourth battle is revealed to take place between Mallow and Lana, surprising the two childhood friends. As Sophocles learns that he\'ll be facing Mina in the fifth battle, he gets all nervous. In their van, Jessie and James follow the announcement as well and are shocked to see themselves in the sixth pair, meaning that only one of them has the chance of advancing past the first round. The seventh battle is revealed to be between Kiawe and Acerola, making Kiawe express his usual fiery confidence. And finally, the eighth battle is revealed to take place between Lillie and Gladion, making Lillie surprised that she\'s going to face her big brother. With all the match-ups revealed, Ash calls for everyone to give it their all, and his classmates respond back with a resounding cheer.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
