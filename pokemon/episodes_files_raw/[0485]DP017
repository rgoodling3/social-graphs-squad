It first aired in Japan on January 25, 2007, and in the United States on July 2, 2007.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/tv-episodes/season-10/episode-17-10_17-wild-in-the-streets/-->\n<i>Continuing to recover from his Oreburgh City Gym battle loss, Ash gets in plenty of training with Turtwig, Pikachu and Aipom. Dawn tries to convince Ash to send home for Pokémon that are strong against Rock Types, but Ash is persistent on using the ones he currently has. Brock lends Ash Sudowoodo to train against, as its Rock Head Ability is immune to such moves as Double Edge.\n\nBack at the Pokémon Center, Dawn finds out that the next Pokémon Contest is at Floaroma Town, where she intends on heading next. Team Rocket steal the Fossil Restorer, unaware that a Pokémon is still inside. Out pops an Aerodactyl, which refuses to be caught by Jessie. Dawn finds Aerodactyl when it attacks the citizens of Oreburgh City; in the ruckus, Kabuto and Armaldo get free as well!\n\nRoark, Brock and Ash triple team the Ancient Pokémon, but Team Rocket show up to steal them all. When Kabuto and Armaldo return to their Poké Balls, Dawn\'s Piplup and Buneary use their agility and grace to avoid Aerodactyl\'s Giga Impact, allowing Dr. Kenzo to get it back into its Poké Ball! Roark\'s newly evolved Rampardos finishes off Team Rocket\'s robot and blasts them off, putting everything back as it should be. Ash asks Roark if he can take on Rampardos in their rematch and he agrees, giving Ash time to craft a battle strategy!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter {{Ash}}\'s [[Oreburgh Gym]] [[DP016|defeat]], he is not letting the loss put him down as he [[Pokémon training|train]]s with his {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} for a [[rematch]]. While {{AP|Pikachu}}, {{AP|Aipom}}, and {{AP|Turtwig}}’s attacks are impressive, smashing through coal ore pillars with ease, {{an|Dawn}} brings up the [[type]] disadvantage his [[party|team]] faces against [[Roark]]\'s {{t|Rock}} Pokémon. Though Ash refuses to retrieve his other Pokémon from {{an|Professor Oak}} or borrow [[Dawn’s Piplup]] for the match. He remarks that [[Paul]] [[DP015|won with type disadvantages]] and knows that he can do the same, which settles the difference. However he does take up {{an|Brock}}’s offer, deciding to practice against {{TP|Brock|Sudowoodo}} since it resembles Roark\'s Pokémon by type and the {{a|Rock Head}} [[Ability]]. Dawn is also inspired and decides to head back to the [[Pokémon Center]] to practice new combinations. When she does get back, the TV inside shows [[Marian]] announcing the location of the next [[Pokémon Contest]], which is in [[Floaroma Town]].\n\n[[Dr. Kenzo]] and his scientists at the [[Oreburgh Mining Museum]] soon discover that one of the three [[Fossil]] revival machines was stolen, immediately reporting it to [[Officer Jenny]]. None of the revived Pokémon were affected, but one points out that the stolen machine had a Fossil inside, which was in the process of being revived. The culprits, {{TRT}} celebrates the successful theft of the machine. They decide to revive Fossils, but they realize that none of them grabbed any Fossils during the heist, which sparks an argument. The revival machine suddenly activates, cutting off the argument, one of the screens displaying complete rebirth. The doors open, and smoke pours out as the figure inside awakens, revealed to be an {{p|Aerodactyl}}. [[Jessie]] tosses a {{i|Poké Ball}} to catch it, but Aerodactyl merely swats it away. It flies off and initiates {{m|Giga Impact}}. While [[James]] tries to use information cards to figure out what the attack is, Aerodactyl swoops down and attacks Team Rocket before it flies towards [[Oreburgh City]].\n\nAsh is still training hard with Brock, pitting Turtwig against Sudowoodo. Ash is trying to find the strategy he needs to win, reflecting on his loss on how Roark\'s Pokémon were fast as well as being able to negate pure power attacks. Roark comes by, intent on digging for more Fossils, and praises Ash’s effort. When he finds a Fossil on the ground, he reveals to Ash and Brock on how he met his {{TP|Roark|Cranidos}}, being the first Fossil to be revived via the machine.\n\nDawn is training with her Pokémon when Aerodactyl appears, firing {{m|Hyper Beam}} at random. She quickly shields her Pokémon, avoiding the blast, before checking her [[Pokédex]] to confirm the {{t|Flying}} creature’s identity. Aerodactyl continues to rampage across town, firing Hyper Beam at random locations, making its way to the museum. It destroys part of the structure, releasing a revived {{p|Armaldo}} and {{p|Kabutops}}. The scientists rush out to try and contain the Pokémon, but Aerodactyl fires a Hyper Beam to stop them. Armaldo and Kabutops attack Aerodactyl with Hyper Beam and {{m|Mud Shot}}, but it flies off, leaving Armaldo and Kabutops to roam freely.\n\n{{si|Ian}} rushes back to Roark and alerts him to the situation. Officer Jenny quickly orders all citizens to evacuate. Officer Jenny and the scientists corner Armaldo and Kabutops at the Oreburgh Mine. Roark steps in and sends out Cranidos to distract them with {{m|Flamethrower}}. Pikachu and Sudowoodo attempt to get close, but Armaldo and Kabutops stop them with fierce attacks. Cranidos uses {{m|Zen Headbutt}}, which freezes both Pokémon. However, Team Rocket shows up and grabs all three Fossil Pokémon with their revival machine [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|mecha]].\n\nPikachu prepares to attack, but Roark reminds them that the Fossil Pokémon and the revival machine are both at risk. Aerodactyl shows up and fires a Hyper Beam, freeing all three Pokémon and knocking down the machine. Dr. Keno and his assistant quickly [[recall]] the Armaldo and Kabutops as Aerodactyl launches Giga Impact at Cranidos. Cranidos stops the attack at first, but it gets pushed back into the group, sending them all rolling. Aerodactyl fires Hyper Beam at Ash and Pikachu, but Dawn arrives, her {{TP|Dawn|Buneary}} and Piplup stopping the attack with {{m|Ice Beam}} and {{m|Bubble Beam}} respectively. Dawn steps forward as Aerodactyl initiates another Giga Impact. Buneary and Piplup wait until it gets close before jumping and spinning past the attack with ease, with the evasive technique impressing Ash. The pair jump and knock down Aerodactyl before Dr. Kenzo throws a Poké Ball, catching it.\n\nTeam Rocket uprights the mecha, though Roark confronts them. As they try to run, Cranidos pursues, but {{MTR}} fires a net missile to imprison Cranidos. Cranidos begins glowing, [[Evolution|evolving]] into {{p|Rampardos}} and shattering the net. Rampardos charges forward and easily catches up, grabbing the machine and detaching the revival machine before using Zen Headbutt to destroy the mecha and send Team Rocket flying. Dr. Kenzo is grateful to have the Fossil restorer back, while and Officer Jenny salutes Rampardos for its help. Afterwards, Ash asks Roark for [[DP018|the rematch the next day]], which is accepted. Ash then asks Dawn to help him with training for the battle, which she accepts.\n\n==Major events ==\n* [[Jessie]] attempts and fails to {{pkmn2|caught|catch}} an {{p|Aerodactyl}}.\n* [[Roark]]\'s {{p|Cranidos}} [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{TP|Roark|Rampardos}}.\n* {{an|Dawn}} learns that a [[Pokémon Contest]] will be held in [[Floaroma Town]].\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Rampardos}} ({{OP|Roark|Rampardos}})\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Paul]] (flashback)\n* [[Roark]]\n* [[Officer Jenny]]\n* [[Marian]] (on television)\n* [[Raoul Contesta]] (on television)\n* [[Mr. Sukizo]] (on television)\n* {{si|Ian}}\n* [[Dr. Kenzo]]\n* Museum researchers\n* [[Pokémon Trainer]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Piplup}} ({{OP|Dawn|Piplup}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Mime Jr.}} ({{OP|James|Mime Jr.}})\n* {{p|Aipom}} ({{OP|Ash|Aipom}})\n* {{p|Turtwig}} ({{OP|Ash|Turtwig}})\n* {{p|Buneary}} ({{OP|Dawn|Buneary}})\n* {{p|Croagunk}} ({{OP|Brock|Croagunk}})\n* {{p|Sudowoodo}} ({{OP|Brock|Sudowoodo}})\n* {{p|Chimchar}} ({{OP|Paul|Chimchar}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Elekid}} ({{OP|Paul|Elekid}}; flashback)\n* {{p|Azumarill}} ([[Paul#Given away|Paul\'s]]; flashback)\n* {{p|Cranidos}} ({{OP|Roark|Rampardos}}; evolves)\n* {{p|Rampardos}} ({{OP|Roark|Rampardos}}; newly evolved; debut)\n* {{p|Onix}} ([[Roark]]\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Geodude}} ([[Roark]]\'s; flashback)\n* {{p|Aerodactyl}} ([[Dr. Kenzo]]\'s; new)\n* {{p|Kabuto}} ([[Dr. Kenzo]]\'s)\n* {{p|Kabutops}} ([[Dr. Kenzo]]\'s)\n* {{p|Omanyte}} ([[Dr. Kenzo]]\'s)\n* {{p|Anorith}} ([[Dr. Kenzo]]\'s)\n* {{p|Armaldo}} ([[Dr. Kenzo]]\'s)\n* {{p|Lileep}} ([[Dr. Kenzo]]\'s)\n* {{p|Psyduck}}\n* {{p|Furret}}\n* {{p|Sunflora}}\n* {{p|Teddiursa}}\n* {{p|Azurill}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* This is the first episode in which [[Dawn\'s Buneary]] shows its affection towards [[Ash\'s Pikachu]] since its capture in \'\'[[DP009|Setting the World on Its Buneary!]]\'\'.\n* [[Professor Oak\'s Big Pokémon Encyclopedia]]: [[Dawn\'s Piplup]]\n** Pokémon senryū: ポッチャマが\u3000みずにとびこむ\u3000ぽっちゃんと \'\'Pochama ga, mizu ni tobikomu, potchanto\'\' "{{p|Piplup|{{tt|Pochama|Piplup}}}} dives into the water with a splash".\n* The episode\'s title might be a reference to the song "Wild In The Streets", performed by {{wp|Garland Jeffreys}}, or another song with the same title performed by {{wp|Bon Jovi}}.\n* {{an|Dawn}} suggests {{Ash}} to send some of his Pokémon that reside in [[Professor Oak\'s Laboratory]] to use in his [[Gym]] {{pkmn|battle}}, but as shown later in \'\'[[DP182|An Old Family Blend!]]\'\', Dawn is surprised to find out that Ash has other Pokémon, showcasing a continuity error.\n\n===Errors===\n* In the scene where [[Dawn\'s Piplup]] and Buneary were dodging {{p|Aerodactyl}}\'s {{m|Giga Impact}}, Buneary\'s bottom was colored brown instead of yellow.\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FCC|bordercolor=99F\n|zh_cmn={{tt|古代神奇寶貝大進擊！|Ancient Pokémon Rampage!}}\n|cs={{tt|Poplach v ulicích|Alert in the Streets}}\n|de={{tt|Die Rückkehr der Fossilien|The return of the fossils}}\n|nl={{tt|Wild in de straten!|Wild in the streets!}}\n|fi={{tt|Kaduilla kuohuu|It roils in the streets}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Terreur sur la ville !|Terror in the city!}}\n|he={{tt|משתוללים ברחובות העיר|Rampanting in the city\'s streets}}\n|it={{tt|Panico in città|Panic in town}} & {{tt|Una nuova sfida|A new challenge}}\n|ko={{tt|고대 포켓몬 부활하다|An ancient Pokémon revives}}\n|ru={{tt|Дикие на свободе|}}\n|pl={{tt|Miasto w niebezpieczeństwie|The city in the danger}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Selvagens Nas Ruas!|Wilds In the Streets!}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Agitação Nas Ruas!|Agitation In the Streets!}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Salvajes por las calles!|Wild in the streets!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Sueltos por las calles|Free in the streets}}\n|sv={{tt|Fullt ös på stan|Full speed in the town}}\n|ro={{tt|Nebunie pe străzi|Madness on the streets}}\n|th={{tt|โปเกมอนโบราณบุกจู่โจม|Ancient Pokémon Rampage}}\n}}\n\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=DP016 |\nprevtitle=A Gruff Act to Follow! |\nnextcode=DP018 |\nnexttitle=O\'er the Rampardos We Watched! |\nseries=Diamond & Pearl series |\ncolorscheme=Sinnoh}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0483}}\n[[Category:Diamond & Pearl series episodes|017]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Atsuhiro Tomioka]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Masamitsu Hidaka]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Yukihiro Makino]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Kazue Kinoshita]]\n\n[[de:Die Rückkehr der Fossilien]]\n[[es:EP486]]\n[[fr:DP017]]\n[[it:DP017]]\n[[ja:DP編第17話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 钻石＆珍珠 第17集]]'}
