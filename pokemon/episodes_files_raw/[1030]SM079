The space-dwelling Pokémon fall to the ground, their heavy shells cracking open in a beautiful display of color and light.\n\nPoipole helps one orange Minior escape its shell, and they quickly become friends! After the next night’s shower, the colorful Pokémon float up into the sky…and gradually disappear, including Poipole’s friend. Sophocles’s cousin Molayne explains that this is the natural order of things, and Sophocles sadly remembers a Minior he befriended years ago, who vanished in the same way. It’s a bittersweet moment, but our heroes are grateful for the experience!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{an|Professor Kukui}} leads his students up to the [[Hokulani Observatory]] when they spot several shooting stars falling nearby. Seeing this, the group decides to make some wishes: {{an|Mallow}} asks for [[Aina\'s Kitchen]] to become famous, {{an|Kiawe}} hopes that [[Mimo|his sister]] and {{TP|Kiawe|Turtonator}} remain in good health, while {{an|Lana}} hopes to hook a {{p|Kyogre}}, {{an|Lillie}} wants to be [[Snowy]]\'s friend forever and {{Ash}} dreams of becoming a [[Pokémon Master]]. {{Rotom}} takes photos of the event, but {{an|Sophocles}} clarifies that the group witnessed {{p|Minior}}, a [[Extraterrestrial Pokémon|Pokémon from outer space]]. Kukui commends Sophocles\'s knowledge and admits to his students that Minior is the reason they are having the excursion. The soon arrive at the observatory and are greeted by [[Molayne]]; Sophocles calls his cousin Big Mo and he is Little So.\n\nKiawe peers through the large telescope and is instantly amazed by the vastness of space. Ash is told to wait his turn and notices Sophocles is not as excited as the other students. Molayne explains that Sophocles has seen space many a time since he was a small kid. Sophocles states that he once made friends with a Minior and points to its shell on top of a table. Ash goes to examine the shell closer and notices something inside, but it turns out to be {{AP|Poipole}} who sprays Ash in a red liquid. Molayne watches Poipole with intrigue. As Ash scolds it, Poipole bumps into Pikachu causing him to fall into his food and he releases an {{t|Electric}} attack. Fortunately, {{TP|Sophocles|Togedemaru}}\'s {{a|Lightning Rod}} Ability absorbs the current. But it soon becomes overexcited and electrocutes everyone after Molayne\'s {{p|Magneton}} appears.\n\nMolayne escorts the school group outside to do some stargazing. Lillie points out the {{p|Ninetales}} {{pkmn|constellation}}, Ash makes out Pikachu and Poipole constellations, while Lana points to a {{p|Rayquaza}} formation. The group rush over to [[Starfall Hill]], where the mystical Minior captivates the student\'s attention. Poipole instantly adores a pink core Minior, and the group soon find themselves surrounded by many different colored Minior. Rotom provides some information while Molayne explains that Minior eat space dust which goes on to make its hardened shell. He adds that the core\'s color is dependent on what materials they consume. Sophocles states that the reason they fall onto the {{pkmn|world}} is because of the weight of their shells. While Kiawe hopes to one day show his sister, the enchanting scene causes Sophocles to have a brief flashback. The group watch as the Minior begin to float upwards. Poipole notices one still in its shell and Ash attempts to force it out. However Molayne warns him against it as Minior are prone to explode. While Ash and Kiawe struggle to carry the Minior back to the observatory, Sophocles\'s flashback continues as he seems to remember attempting to open its shell by hand but nothing else. \n\nThe next morning, Kukui and Molayne enjoy the frigid air and bright sunrise, believing the night\'s conditions will be perfect for more Minior viewing. Molayne asks Kukui how much does he want the children to learn about Minior, and Kukui replies that the experience is good for them. While the students are sound asleep in bunks, Poipole ventures over to the blanket-covered Minior and touches it with its tail. Much to its surprise, Minior\'s shell cracks open and a bright light begins to fill the room. Poipole\'s scream wakes up the drowsy students and they make it in time to witness Minior\'s shell crack open and reveal its orange core. Sophocles instantly remembers the identical scene from his past, though with a pink core Minior emerging and his memory jolts to his teary face. While Minior explores its new surroundings, it is sent into a spin after Poipole covers it in a blue liquid. As an apology, Poipole inks a Minior mural on one of the laboratory walls, and the pair soon become friends.\n\nThe students spend their day sliding down a hill and playing an intense game of [[Baseball|Pokémon Base]]. Afterwards, Molayne catches his cousin sitting by himself underneath a tree and asks if anything is wrong. Sophocles admits that he has been thinking a lot and cannot remember anything about the time he found a Minior. Meanwhile, Kukui calls all the students for a break. Over a picnic lunch, Lillie wonders if Minior will return like the others. Molayne says that tonight will be the peak of the shower event, with plenty of color. Ash asks Sophocles if his Minior had returned, and he confesses that he cannot remember.\n\nAt night the group relish in another spectacular Minior shower. Sophocles\'s memories are becoming clearer as he remembers watching his Minior make its way over to several other Minior. Molayne walks over to Ash and Kiawe who are examining a fragile piece of shell. He add that Minior\'s shells tend to burn up when they enter the world\'s atmosphere, leaving only the core. Ash asks about the orange core Minior\'s shell, and Molayne states that its heavier shell is a rarity. Sophocles finally clarifies and believes his Minior floated back to space with the others. Just as it occurs, Poipole, Ash and the others watch on as Sophocles explains that the Minior simply fade away as they are no longer protected by their shells. Everyone is saddened by Minior\'s disappearance but humbled by the experience. Kukui explains that memories of friendship are far more important than one having a friend with them, as Ash offers comfort to Poipole. Lana suddenly spots an actual Rayquaza flying overhead, and Sophocles explains that it is also a space Pokémon.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
