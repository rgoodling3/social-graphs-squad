Their Name is {{tt|Galaxy-dan|Team Galactic}}!!\'\') is the 69th episode of {{series|Diamond & Pearl}}, and the 535th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on March 6, 2008 and in the United States on August 9, 2008.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/11_17-enter-galactic/-->\n<i>Before Ash and his friends leave Veilstone City, Paul\'s brother Reggie shows him the city\'s most famous sight: a field full of ancient meteorites that are considered the guardians of the city. Then it\'s off to the Pokémon Center to plan for Ash\'s next destination, the Gym in Pastoria City. All the while, Team Galactic prepares to execute the next stage in their grand scheme—Commander Saturn has come to town with the strange cube he took from the Solaceon Ruins, and the meteorites\' presence transforms the cube into the Spear Key. With the Key now in hand, Saturn signals for the second phase to begin.\n\nFrom their secret base in Veilstone, Team Galactic jams the entire city with a magnetic wave, disrupting everything from the communications grid to the medical equipment at the Pokémon Center. Using that as cover, they move in to steal the meteorites. Gym Leader Maylene\'s Lucario senses that something\'s afoot, so she and our heroes rush to the meteorite field and find Team Galactic ready to fly off with the meteorites.\n\nEven with Officer Jenny as reinforcement, Ash and the gang are still outnumbered as they try to stop Team Galactic. While Brock\'s Croagunk faces down Saturn\'s Toxicroak, Team Galactic\'s minions release a swarm of Golbat. The Golbat hold everyone off—until Reggie and Paul\'s Electabuzz show up and Electabuzz teams up with Pikachu to unleash Electric-type attacks. The tide turns and Pikachu helps cut the meteorites loose, forcing Team Galactic to retreat. Another victory for the forces of good! However, despite the loss of the meteorites, Team Galactic\'s scheme is still proceeding as planned...</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAs {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} are preparing to leave [[Veilstone City]], [[Reggie]] takes them to see the meteors of the city. The gang marvel at where the meteors could have come from, as red, green and blue lights appear far overhead. Back at the Pokémon Center, Ash plans the next Gym to go to, with Nurse Joy suggesting Pastoria\'s Gym. Meanwhile, [[Saturn]] steps out of a helicopter and heads into the Veilstone Galactic Headquarters with a mysterious box in hand. He briefs the {{tc|Galactic Grunt|Grunts}} about what their mission is, and then leaves to go to the park where the meteors are held.\n\nMeanwhile, {{TRT}} is planning and singing about how they will steal the meteors, until [[James]] points out that trying to lift one, all four would receive a hernia. They are interrupted by helicopters touching down, while others hover overhead. In the [[Pokémon Center]], Reggie is talking on the videophone with [[Paul]]. Reggie comments to Paul about how Ash is a formidable opponent, which annoys Paul. Back at the meteor field, Saturn steps out of a helicopter and gets out the box, revealing it to be the [[Spear Key]]. In the meteor\'s presence, the cube-like key hovers and reforms into a different shape, and as this happens, the meteors start glowing and release beams of light into the air. Many people, including Ash, {{an|Dawn}}, {{an|Brock}}, [[Maylene]], and Reggie, take notice. Saturn then radios HQ to run the scrambling. The grunt on the other end complies, and communications and all technology (excluding vehicles and Galactic Equipment) across the city go down. This prompts [[Officer Jenny]] to dispatch forces across the city, while the gang heads over to the hill. En route, they bump into Maylene and her {{TP|Maylene|Lucario}}, who tells them that [[Connally]] has gone to inform Jenny about what\'s happening.\n\n[[File:Veilstone Meteors.png|thumb|100px|right|The meteors of [[Veilstone City]]]]\nWhile this is happening, [[Team Galactic]] notice Team Rocket, and the Trio start their {{motto}}, only to be interrupted by a nonchalant Saturn sending out his {{TP|Saturn|Toxicroak}}, who blasts them a short distance with a {{m|Sludge Bomb}}. The gang arrive and suspect the Rocket\'s to be behind it, to the ire of Jessie. Toxicroak sends a {{m|Dark Pulse}} at them all, and Lucario quickly intervenes with an {{m|Aura Sphere}} which has no effect on Toxicroak. Jenny then arrives, and confronts and reveals who Team Galactic are. At this point, Saturn tells the grunts to release their {{p|Golbat}} to distract the group, in order for the meteors to continue being lifted. The group struggles with the Golbat, until Reggie arrives with {{TP|Paul|Electabuzz}} to help in the fight. While the fight is going on, [[Brock\'s Croagunk]] and Saturn\'s Toxicroak are battling, when Team Rocket get in middle of two attacks and end up blasting off. The group take out many of the Golbat after a lucky shot from a combined electric attack by {{AP|Pikachu}} and Electabuzz. Electabuzz becomes surrounded by Golbat, until Pikachu uses {{m|Thunderbolt}} to disperse them, and asks if Electabuzz is OK. One of the Golbat, however, manages to fire off a {{m|Shadow Ball}} at Pikachu, which Electabuzz blocks. The attention turns to the helicopters, and the gang turns their attention to the cables attached to the meteors. Pikachu uses {{m|Volt Tackle}}, supercharged by Electabuzz\'s {{m|Thunder}} attack, Lucario uses Bone Rush to cut the cables, and [[Dawn\'s Piplup]] uses {{m|Whirlpool}} to contain the meteors to protect them. Saturn sighs at the grunts telling him that it\'s time, and retreats. Pikachu and Lucario send off a Thunderbolt and an Aura Sphere respectively, but the helicopters are too far away.\n\nAsh apologizes for not being able to apprehend them, but Jenny says that everyone is safe, as are the meteors, so it\'s a job well done. Meanwhile, in the helicopter, Saturn discusses how their next plan is at the lake, as Team Galactic flies into the sunset.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} decides to head for the [[Pastoria Gym]] next via [[Lake Valor]].\n* Ash and {{ashfr}} learn of [[Team Galactic]] and encounter them for the first time.\n* Ash and his friends encounter Team Galactic {{tc|Commander}} [[Saturn]] for the first time.\n* [[Ash\'s Pikachu]] and [[Paul\'s Electabuzz]] settle their differences.\n* [[Reggie]] prepares to send Electabuzz back to [[Paul]].\n* The cube Team Galactic stole from the [[Solaceon Ruins]] [[DP060|earlier]] is revealed to be the [[Spear Key]].\n* [[Brock\'s Croagunk]] starts a rivalry with [[Saturn\'s Toxicroak]].\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Toxicroak}} ({{OP|Saturn|Toxicroak}})\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Reggie]]\n* [[Maylene]]\n* [[Paul]]\n* [[Saturn]]\n* [[Nurse Joy]]\n* [[Officer Jenny]]\n* {{tc|Galactic Grunt|Team Galactic Grunts}}\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Piplup}} ({{OP|Dawn|Piplup}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Croagunk}} ({{OP|Brock|Croagunk}})\n* {{p|Electabuzz}} ({{OP|Paul|Electabuzz}})\n* {{p|Lucario}} ({{OP|Maylene|Lucario}})\n* {{p|Toxicroak}} ({{OP|Saturn|Toxicroak}}; debut)\n* {{p|Golbat}} ({{tc|Galactic Grunt|Team Galactic Grunts}}\'; multiple)\n* {{p|Chansey}}\n* {{p|Munchlax}}\n* {{p|Starly}}\n* {{p|Shinx}}\n* {{p|Cherubi}}\n* {{p|Stunky}}\n* {{p|Budew}}\n* {{p|Unown}} (multiple; flashback)\n\n==Trivia==\n* This is one of the few episodes (if not the first) to feature a town map with high detail.\n* This is also one of the few episodes to feature {{TRT}} reciting their motto off-screen.\n* The dub title is a pun on the word "intergalactic".\n* As [[Team Galactic]] makes their escape, [[Saturn]] mentions the [[Red Chain]] and that their next mission will be at one of the three lakes.\n* [[Professor Oak\'s Big Pokémon Encyclopedia]]: [[Ash\'s Buizel]]\n* Music from \'\'[[M09|Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea]]\'\' is used in some parts of this episode.\n\n===Errors===\n* When {{Ash}} mentions the events of \'\'[[DP060|Journey to the Unown!]]\'\', he says {{ashfr|the group}} was at [[Eterna City]] when they were actually at [[Solaceon Town]].\n** However, he may have been referring to \'\'[[DP036|A Secret Sphere of Influence!]]\'\', when Team Rocket stole the [[Adamant Orb]] from the [[Eterna Historical Museum]] for Team Galactic.\n* When Ash mentions seeing Team Galactic, the flashback displayed is of what Team Rocket saw, and not him.\n* Despite Team Galactic throwing 36 {{i|Poké Ball}}s into the air, only fifteen {{p|Golbat}} appear.\n* [[Officer Jenny]] says that they managed to get all of the meteors back despite the group only saving two.\n* When Team Rocket talks about stealing the meteorites, the sound of {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} popping out of its Poké Ball is heard, even though Wobbuffet was already outside it.\n* In the {{pmin|Poland|Polish}} dub, for unknown reasons, [[Saturn]]\'s voice actor is switched during one scene.\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FCC|bordercolor=99F\n|zh_cmn={{tt|新潮打扮！其名為銀河隊！！|Modern Style!
