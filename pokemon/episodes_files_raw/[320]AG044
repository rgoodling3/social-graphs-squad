She's received an invitation to a Togepi Festival, and is soon greeted by Team Rocket disguised as the operating committee for the festival. They escort Misty and Togepi inside a large building, which turns out to be a concealed zeppelin. Ash and friends climb aboard before takeoff, and the aircraft makes its way to the Mirage Kingdom.\n\nMisty leaves the zeppelin and is met by Colonel Hansen, who demands that she turn over Togepi. Ash and Brock step forward to protect her, sending out Mudkip and Pikachu. Misty, May, and Max flee while Pikachu and Mudkip battle Colonel Hansen's two Ninjask.\n\nColonel Hansen's Shedinja catches up with Misty, who sends out her Corsola. During the battle, Togepi is blasted away and found unconscious in a stream by the princess of the Mirage Kingdom. A servant tells the king that the princess has finally found a Togepi, and they all gather in the princess' quarters to look at it.\n\nMisty arrives and demands the return of her Togepi. The princess and the servant explain that Togepi are worshipped in the Mirage Kingdom, and in order to become ruler, the princess must have one in her possession for the coronation ceremony. Colonel Hansen wants the throne for himself, which is why he tried to steal Misty's Togepi. The princess decides to send Misty and friends home with Togepi.\n\nAs the gang are about to board the zeppelin, a mirror image of the temple appears in the sky. Togepi begins to glow and float toward it. Colonel Hansen arrives with Team Rocket, and his Shedinja attacks the group using Solar Beam, which Pikachu attempts to block with Thundershock.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and his [[Hoenn]] {{ashfr|traveling companions}} wait by a river for an old friend to meet them. {{an|Misty}} rushes to greet Ash and {{an|Brock}}, adding that her {{ci|Cerulean}} [[Gym Leader]] duties are going well. She proceeds to tell {{an|May}} and [[Max]] that she already knows their names. Misty shows off her invitation to a convention for {{p|Togepi}} {{pkmn|Trainer}}s and approaches the hotel behind them. Then, two mysterious people [[Team Rocket's disguises|dressed in Togepi patterned clothes]] approach Misty and promptly carry her into the hotel before closing the doors on the others. They place Misty and {{TP|Misty|Togepi}} into the so-called VIP room, and on [[Jessie]]'s signal, {{MTR}} pulls a latch. The hotel building falls away revealing a blimp. Ash and his friends realize something is amiss and grab onto a rope from the floating blimp before pulling themselves aboard. The blimp flies over a desert and through a sandstorm before reaching its destination, the [[Mirage Kingdom]]. \n\nAfter Meowth lands the blimp, and Jessie and [[James]] don their disguise again. As Misty leaves the blimp, Ash and the others emerge. When asked for their identity, Team Rocket gladly recites their {{motto}}. Misty becomes furious at them, thinking that they were trying to steal {{AP|Pikachu}}. However, Team Rocket tells them that they were actually after Togepi. As Meowth leaps to snatch Togepi, [[Colonel Hansen]] steps in. He is disgruntled with the Rocket trio for bringing in the Trainers and throws Meowth directly at James's head. Colonel Hansen introduces himself as the Mirage Kingdom leader and demands Togepi. Misty absolutely refuses, so with a snap of his fingers Colonel Hansen orders {{p|Shedinja}} to demonstrate its {{m|Solar Beam}}. A pair of {{p|Ninjask}} appear, instantly triggering Misty’s fear of {{t|Bug}} Pokémon. Ash and Brock face Hansen with {{AP|Pikachu}} and {{TP|Brock|Mudkip}}, while Misty, Max, and May run. When Hansen notices that the Togepi is getting away, he commands Shedinja to go after them. Misty and the siblings keep running until they reach a hedge maze. Shedinja appears, freaking Misty out, but she is determined to protect Togepi. She sends out {{TP|Misty|Corsola}} and orders it to use {{m|Spike Cannon}}. Unfortunately, the attack did not harm the Bug Pokémon a bit. Shedinja retaliates with another Solar Beam, hitting Misty so hard that she loses Togepi. \n\nTogepi lands in a garden fountain, where it soon discovered by [[Princess Sara]] as she tends to her roses. Sara takes it to her assistant, {{ho|Miranda}} who whisks Togepi to the palace for treatment. Miranda rushes into the throne room and informs the [[King and Queen of the Mirage Kingdom|King]] that a Togepi found its way to the Princess. The Queen is with her daughter and announces that the succession ceremony can take place tomorrow. The King and Miranda soon enter the room to marvel at the miraculous arrival of a Togepi, though Misty barges into the palace to collect her Togepi. Miranda stops Misty from reaching the Princess and Colonel Hansen rushes in to inform his majesty that Misty and the others are intruders. May and Misty challenge Hansen's account, and the King calls for Hansen to leave the room immediately. Ash and Brock rush in just as Colonel Hansen leaves. Afterwards the King escorts the group to his throne room to sincerely apologize for the misunderstanding. Misty is happily reunited with Togepi, with Princess Sara admitting she knew it was too good to be true. The King calls for them to leave the Kingdom immediately, though Misty demands to know what is happening. \n\nOutside the coronation temple, Miranda explains that Togepi have been a symbol for Mirage Kingdom for centuries, adding that the Pokemon is needed to determine the next ruler. Sara admits that her quest to find a Togepi has not been successful, and suggests Colonel Hansen was hoping to take the throne himself and Miranda second this. Brock gladly offers his assistance to the Princess, though Misty pulls him back by the ear before tossing him aside. Max and May are mildly impressed by Misty's handling style, but equally terrified. Misty offers her assistance to the Princess, but Sara refuses to place anyone in danger. However, as Misty and the others are about to leave, they notice a reflection of the temple appear in the sky. Togepi seems to be reaching for it and then it begins to float away. Suddenly Hansen's Shedinja appears, though Misty manages to rescue Togepi before the Bug-type launches its Solar Beam. Hansen and Team Rocket appear, demanding Togepi once again. At Misty’s refusal, Shedinja charges another Solar Beam at them and Pikachu counters it with his {{m|Thunderbolt}}.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:Misty AG.png|thumb|220px|Misty making her return appearance]]\n* {{an|Misty}} returns, with {{an|May}} and [[Max]] meeting her for the first time.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Humans====\n* {{ho|Miranda}}\n* [[Princess Sara]]\n* [[Colonel Hansen]]\n* [[King and Queen of the Mirage Kingdom]]\n\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* {{p|Ninjask}}\n* {{p|Shedinja}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* {{an|May}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Max]]\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* {{ho|Miranda}}\n* [[Princess Sara]]\n* [[Colonel Hansen]]\n* [[King and Queen of the Mirage Kingdom]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:PTC AG044.png|thumb|200px|Pokémon Trainer's Choice]]\n[[Pokémon Trainer’s Choice]]: {{p|Minun}}\n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Togepi}} ({{OP|Misty|Togepi}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Corsola}} ({{OP|Misty|Corsola}})\n* {{p|Mudkip}} ({{OP|Brock|Marshtomp}})\n* {{p|Shedinja}} ([[Colonel Hansen]]'s; debut)\n* {{p|Ninjask}} ([[Colonel Hansen]]'s; ×2; debut)\n{{-}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* This was the first episode featuring {{an|Misty}}'s {{series2|Advanced Generation}} outfit.\n* This was also Misty's first main series appearance after ''[[EP273|Gotta Catch Ya Later!]]''.\n* This episode aired in the United States exactly one year after its Japanese air date.\n* The English dub title is based on the {{pmin|Denmark|Danish}} fairy-tale ''{{wp|The Princess and the Pea}}'' by {{wp|Hans Christian Andersen}}.\n* The Japanese voice artists for {{Ash}}'s first three female traveling companions are featured in this episode and the [[AG045|next one]]; [[Mayumi Iizuka]] and [[KAORI.]] voice Misty and {{an|May}}, respectively; and [[Megumi Toyoguchi]], who voices [[Princess Sara]] in this episode, went on to play {{an|Dawn}} during the {{series|Diamond & Pearl}}.\n* This is the first episode to use music from ''[[M05|Pokémon Heroes: Latios & Latias]]''.
