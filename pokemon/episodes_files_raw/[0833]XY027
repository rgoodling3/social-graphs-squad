It first aired in Japan on May 15, 2014, in the United Kingdom on June 29, 2014, and in the United States on July 19, 2014.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/17_26-to-find-a-fairy-flower/-->\n<i>When a tiny and sad-looking Pokémon lands in Bonnie\'s hair, our heroes are determined to find out what\'s wrong! Its Trainer, Grey, explains that the little Flabébé has a special bond with his wife, Florence. She recently became ill, and when Flabébé tried to visit her in the hospital, a passing car blew its flower away. Without its flower, Flabébé is growing weak, but it won’t accept just any flower as a replacement—it needs a Fairy Flower, and those are hard to find!\n\nOur heroes set out in search of the flower, "assisted" by Team Rocket disguised as tour guides. Bonnie spots a Fairy Flower growing high on the side of a cliff, and since Flabébé is too weak to fly, she climbs up after it as Ash, Serena, and Clemont watch anxiously from below.\n\nWhile they’re distracted, Team Rocket nabs Pikachu! As a battle to reclaim it begins, Flabébé bonds with its new flower, and once its energy is restored, it floats over the villains and sprinkles them with its relaxing pollen. The Team Rocket members happily release Pikachu and wander off in a joyful daze!\n\nOur heroes take Flabébé to meet Grey at the hospital. Florence perks up immediately upon seeing her dear friend. And though Bonnie has to say goodbye, her kindness and courage have saved the day!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAs {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} prepare to set off again to the [[Shalour Gym]], {{an|Bonnie}} encounters difficulties while fixing her hair. When {{an|Serena}} puts a flower clip in Bonnie\'s hair, a lone {{p|Flabébé}} attaches herself to it, looking downhearted. Bonnie feeds the Flabébé nectar, and then asks {{an|Clemont}} if she can keep the Pokémon. When Clemont tries to capture her, however, the Flabébé refuses, and Ash points out she must already have a trainer, angering Bonnie. The friends walk into the nearest town, [[Calanthe Town]], to find her owner, with Bonnie still wanting to keep Flabébé for herself, talking to her in her hair by way of a mirror. Suddenly, an old man, spotting the Flabébé, runs up to the group, overjoyed. He introduces himself as {{OBP|Grey|XY027}} and thanks the group for taking care of his Pokémon. When he asks Flabébé to go home with him, however, she will not let go of Bonnie\'s hair. When asked about Flabébé\'s lack of a flower, the man explains his story. \n\nFlabébé lives together with Grey and his wife Florence. One day while gardening, Florence fell ill and collapsed. Flabébé, then with a flower, flew to find Grey. Florence was admitted to a hospital, where the old woman would stay. When Grey woke up the next morning, Flabébé was gone. On a hunch, he found Flabébé at the hospital, watching Florence. A strong wind separated Flabébé and her flower, and carried Flabébé away, her flower left ruined. Now Grey must take Flabébé back quickly, as Florence is not doing well, due to an emotional matter. As flowerless Flabébé will lose their energy, they must find Flabébé a same flower as her original before they can take her to the hospital. However, this fairy flower, which resembles Bonnie\'s hairpiece, is not easy to find. The traveling companions tell Grey to go visit Florence while they go search for the flower. \n\nThe group first goes to a [[Pokémon Center]] to heal Flabébé, where [[Nurse Joy]] tells them the flowers may be found in the high plains near the town, but they are not in season. {{TRT}} watches from behind newspapers and hatches a plan. As Bonnie and the group are about to head out, a disguised Team Rocket stops them, offering a special tour to find the fairy flowers. The "tour guides" guide the group quickly to the high plains, where the travelers begin to look for a flower. Flabébé spots one high on the side of a cliff, which Bonnie must climb because Flabébé must attach herself naturally to the flower. {{MTR}} encapsules {{AP|Pikachu}} with a claw as Bonnie and Flabébé reach the flower. Ash, Clemont, and Serena take out {{AP|Froakie}}, {{TP|Clemont|Chespin}}, and {{TP|Serena|Fennekin}}, while [[Jessie]] and [[James]] retaliate with {{TP|Jessie|Pumpkaboo}} and {{TP|James|Inkay}}. Ash commands Froakie to use {{m|Water Pulse}}, but the move is reflected by Jessie\'s {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}}\'s {{m|Mirror Coat}}. Chespin uses {{m|Pin Missile}}, but it is reflected again, hurting Ash, Clemont, and Serena\'s Pokémon. James and Jessie order Inkay and Pumpkaboo to use {{m|Psybeam}} and {{m|Shadow Ball}} on the opposing Pokémon, who are unable to retaliate. Just then, Flabébé, now on the new flower, flies over the battlefield, using {{m|Aromatherapy}} to subdue Team Rocket and their Pokémon. Under the calming effects of Flabébé\'s attack, Team Rocket releases Pikachu on their own accord. With Team Rocket out of the way, Flabébé and the travelers return to town to find Grey. \n\nThe friends arrive at the hospital, and Florence and Flabébé are reunited, giving the old woman hope. Grey and Florence thank Bonnie, and Bonnie and Flabébé share a heartfelt goodbye. Coming out of the hospital, Bonnie is upset about having to leave Flabébé, but {{TP|Clemont|Dedenne}} cheers her up to continue on their journey.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
