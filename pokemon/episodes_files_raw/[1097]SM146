Respective Departures!!\'\') is the 146th and final episode of the {{series|Sun & Moon}}, and the 1,085th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on November 3, 2019<!-- and is scheduled to air in the United States on *day*-->.\n{{spoilers}}\n<!--\n==Blurb==\nOfficial Blurb from Pokémon.com goes here, with source link-->\n<!--Please do not alter the blurb to fix any errors, they are meant to be presented as they are on the official site.-->\n\n==Plot==\nAt the [[Pokémon School]], {{an|Kiawe}} informs the others that he will be {{pkmn|training}} under [[Olivia]] during the vacation. {{Ash}} is about to confirm his own plans when {{an|Lillie}} enters the classroom flocked by [[Snowy]] and, to everyone’s surprise, {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Magearna}}. {{Rotom}} takes the opportunity to collect data on Magearna as the class congratulates Lillie on finally reactivating the [[Mythical Pokémon]]. Lillie admits {{p|Zoroark}} was the key. Lillie then pauses momentarily before revealing that she is accompanying her {{an|Lusamine|mother}} and {{an|Gladion|brother}} on a journey to find [[Mohn|her father]]. {{an|Mallow}} presses for more details, but Lillie replies that Magearna will guide them. Lillie explains further, following Magearna\'s reawakening, its Soul Heart absorbed energy from her [[Z-Ring]] before projecting a beam of light. Magearna affirms the symbolic act by pointing to a photo of Mohn, causing Gladion and Lillie to realize they might be able to find their father. To everyone\'s relief, Lillie assures her friends that she will return to [[Alola]] once she has found her father. Ash, however, is well aware of his own world travel plans and briefly turns away.\n\nMeanwhile at [[Bewear\'s den]], while enjoying some honey courtesy of {{an|Bewear}}, {{TRT}} receives a call from HQ. [[Jessie]] and {{MTR}} continue to eat in an attempt to avoid facing [[Matori]] and her {{TP|Matori|Meowth}}, though {{TP|Jessie|Mimikyu}} answers the call. To the trio\'s shock, the call instead turns out to be from {{an|Giovanni}}, who orders them to return to the {{an|Team Rocket HQ}} immediately. Matori steps into view, adding that the trio have kept Giovanni waiting long enough for results. After Giovanni signs off, Jessie and [[James]] look at their Pokémon, thinking about what to do with them.\n\nLater, {{an|Professor Kukui}} farewells his class as they embark on the long vacation break. Ash and {{ashcl}} plan to hang after school, though Lillie admits she has a lot to prepare for her upcoming trip. Before she leaves, Mallow requests that she stop by [[Aina\'s Kitchen]] to collect a specially designed recipe for Snowy. Lillie promises to pick it up tomorrow and then continues onto her chauffeured car. Everyone grins and Mallow declares that the plan is working. \n\nTeam Rocket gets straight into backing up their Alolan HQ. Jessie reminds James that he has to speak to {{TP|James|Mareanie}} about their departure. James retorts that Mimikyu must know as well, though Jessie brushes him off as she admits that Mimikyu is adaptable. Mareanie soon enters the room, examining the moving boxes out of curiosity. James reluctantly approaches Mareanie with the bad news that they will be returning to HQ. However, Mareanie is thrilled as it imagines more time with her Trainer, and she promptly poisons him out of affection. James clarifies that Mareanie and Mimikyu will actually be remaining with Bewear and {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Stufful}}. Mareanie fails to understand the news due to her infatuation, making the painful goodbye a much harder task.\n\nWhile returning home, Ash stops by the shore to marvel at the Alolan sunset. Rotom wonders when Ash will inform his friends about his own departure, and he replies that tomorrow will be the day. Unexpectedly Mimikyu attempts to lash {{AP|Pikachu}} with a {{m|Shadow Claw}}, though Pikachu evades in time. Pikachu uses {{m|Thunderbolt}} to combat an oncoming {{m|Shadow Ball}}, before swatting its vengeful opponent out to sea with an {{m|Iron Tail}}. Mimikyu attempts to keep itself above the water, but falls in after seeing its own reflection. Pikachu and Ash retrieve the limp Pokémon from the waves. Mimikyu quickly recovers, however its somber retreat leaves Ash and Rotom suspicious of its uncharacteristic behaviour. Ash offers to get it home, though Mimikyu waves at him as it continues to leave. As Ash and Pikachu agree that it\'s time to go home, another unexpected visitor, {{DL|Light trio (anime)|Solgaleo|Nebby}}, suddenly appears and greets them.\n\nAt night, Meowth catches up to the still sulky Mimikyu to talk things over. Mimikyu explains that it saw its own face while attacking Pikachu earlier. Meowth remarks that nothing good comes from hatred and suggests that it might be time for a change of direction. Mimikyu takes the words to heart and instantly wipes away its tears as it prepares for a new future. Later, Stufful, Mareanie and Mimikyu are all sleeping soundly. James whispers his apologies to Mareanie for having to leave her, and he gifts her the trio\'s [[Z-Power Ring]] as a token of his gratitude. James steps outside where Jessie and the others are waiting to leave. The quartet officially thank Bewear for her hospitality while in Alola. Bewear responds with a large, friendly hug, filling the trio with warmth. Now aboard their balloon, the three bid Bewear a final farewell. She says something to them, and Meowth translates that she\'s asking if they\'re heading to [[Kanto]]. When they confirm they are, Bewear decides to assist their flight back by using her strength to send them blasting off in the direction of their destination.\n\nThe next morning, Lillie keeps her promise and arrives at Aina\'s Kitchen. However, she gets enveloped in a bubble before Kiawe, {{an|Lana}}, {{an|Sophocles}}, and Mallow happily declare that this is a surprise party. The Pokémon happily enjoy the sweet treats on offer while Mallow and the others are waiting for Ash’s arrival. A loud roar alerts them to something outside – none other than Ash, Pikachu and Rotom riding into view atop of Nebby. Ash apologizes for the delay, admitting that he just returned from an adventure through an [[Ultra Wormhole]]. He adds they visited a strange world, where they helped an [[Ultra Beast]]. Despite Ash\'s vague explanation, Rotom offers to show everyone the footage later. They praise Rotom for always being a huge help, to which Rotom replies that Lusamine said the same thing - as of today, it is an employee of [[Aether Paradise]]. Ash informs his friends of his own news – he will be returning to [[Pallet Town]] before embarking on another journey towards his ultimate goal, to become a [[Pokémon Master]]. Kiawe and the others are taken aback by the surprise confession, though offer their full support.\n\nBefore long, it is time for Lillie, Gladion, and Lusamine to embark on their venture to find Mohn. Their colleagues and friends wish the family well from the departure port. Lillie promises to keep in contact with her classmates, slightly shying away as she says goodbye to Ash. Gladion hopes to battle Ash again someday, with the pair shaking on it. Rotom calls for everyone to gather, and it promptly immortalizes the moment with a group photo. The ship soon leaves port, with Lillie and her family waving their friends farewell from an open deck. Lillie is spurred into action by her memories of Ash. She runs to the back of the ship to shout out to Ash that she is glad to have met him because he helped her overcome her fear of touching Pokémon. Ash thanks her in return, waving off his dear friend. \n\nKukui and [[Professor Burnet]] drive Ash and Pikachu down to the airport that evening. Before he boards his flight, Ash asks Kukui to look after the Pokémon he caught in Alola. Kukui is glad to have the Pokémon join his family, adding that he will bring them to school on occasion. He and Burnet pledge to support Ash, whenever and wherever he is. Burnet is brought to tears as she hugs Ash, with Kukui joining the embrace. Ash and Pikachu promptly board their plane, peering out of the window as it takes off. Ash\'s friends, wearing their [[Ultra Guardians]] outfits, soar into view to deliver a wave goodbye and good luck.\n\nAs the vacation starts, Sophocles heads off with his cousin, [[Molayne]] to [[Mossdeep City]]. Kiawe flies off on {{TP|Kiawe|Charizard}} for his training with Olivia. Later, Lana offers to bring a fish print of {{p|Manaphy}} for Mallow, as she climbs aboard [[Lana\'s father|her father]]\'s boat. Mallow returns to Aina’s Kitchen, where she is greeted by her older brother [[Ulu]]. He presents her with a bouquet of wild flowers he spotted on his return home. [[Abe]] greets Ulu, who affirms that he is returning home for good. {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Shaymin}}, meanwhile, takes an interest in the bouquet and promptly changes into its Sky Forme from the [[Gracidea]] pollen. Shaymin rushes outside the restaurant, where it is greeted by a group of other Shaymin. Mallow immediately realizes that yet another friend is leaving. With a final nuzzle, Shaymin soars into the sky to join its friends, soon disappearing from view. Back in Bewear\'s den, Mareanie and Mimikyu are enjoying their time with Bewear and Stufful. Over on [[Ula\'ula Island]], [[Hau]], supported by his grandfather [[Hala]], takes on [[Nanu]] in a [[Island challenge|grand trial]] match. Meanwhile, [[Guzma]] is whipping his {{tc|Team Skull Grunt}}s into shape with some battle training, with [[Plumeria]] observing. Rotom is already making remarkable progress with its research, but its findings are overwhelming {{an|Faba}} and [[Wicke]]. Finally, Kukui is by his wife’s side as she lies on a foldout chair. She holds her swelled belly, and Kukui places his hand over hers, indicating that they\'re expecting a baby.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

Being the last episode of the series, this is to be expected.-->\n[[File:And your dreams.png|250px|thumb|...and your dreams!]]\n* This is the last episode to air in Japan before the release of [[Pokémon Sword and Shield]].\n* Unlike the final episodes of the first four [[series]], the phrase \'\'Next Time... A New Beginning!\'\' is not used; instead, the normal \'\'To be continued\'\' is replaced with \'\'...and your dreams!\'\' This could be a reference to the closing lines of [[Type: Wild]], which are played as the words appear on the screen.\n** This is similar to how [[XY140|the final episode]] of the {{series|XY}} ended with the phrase "\'\'And to our own way!\'\'".\n* This episode did not display the opening credits until the start of the ending theme.\n* This episode has the longest credits sequence of any episode, with the credits being displayed onscreen over a span of approximately two minutes and 30 seconds.\n* This episode marks the first time {{Ash}} didn\'t bring the Pokémon he caught in a region back to [[Kanto]] with him. He instead left them with {{an|Professor Kukui}}.\n* This is the first episode that both [[Jessie]] and [[James]] release a {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} at the same time since \'\'[[AG006|A Poached Ego!]]\'\', 805 episodes ago.\n** This is also the first time a main character has released a Pokémon two episodes in a row.\n* {{TRT}} doesn\'t recite their {{motto}} in this episode.\n* This episode marks the first time in the {{pkmn|anime}} that a character is shown displaying any physical signs of pregnancy.\n* This episode features the following flashbacks of {{an|Lillie}}\'s time in [[Alola]]:\n** Being afraid to touch {{AP|Pikachu}} when {{Ash}} tries to get rid of fear of touching {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} in \'\'[[SM008|Lillie\'s Egg-xhilarating Challenge!]]\'\'.\n** Her falling to the ground with [[Snowy]] in \'\'[[SM014|Getting to Know You!]]\'\'.\n** Celebrating after defeating [[Hobbes]]\'s {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Oricorio|Pom-Pom style}} {{p|Oricorio}} with Ash\'s Pikachu in \'\'[[SM030|The Ol\' Raise and Switch!]]\'\'.\n** Her hugging her {{an|Lusamine|mom}} after Ash defeated {{DL|Ultra Beasts (anime)|Nihilego}} in \'\'[[SM054|10,000,000 Reasons to Fight!]]\'\'.\n** Facing {{p|Persian|Pershie}} in \'\'[[SM083|Dummy, You Shrunk the Kids!]]\'\'.\n** Her and Ash talking about {{Rotom}} in \'\'[[SM098|Bright Lights, Big Changes!]]\'\'.\n** Watching Ash use {{m|10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt}} against {{an|Professor Kukui}} in [[SM144]].\n* The shot of Ash and Pikachu leaving [[Alola]] is very similar to the the shot of them leaving [[Kanto]] during the flashback in \'\'[[SM001|Alola to New Adventure!]]\'\'.\n* When {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Shaymin}} changes into its {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Shaymin|Sky Forme}}, its eyes are notably different when compared to the eyes of a regular Sky Forme {{p|Shaymin}}, instead resembling those of [[Mallow\'s mother]].\n* This episode was followed by a preview for the [[new series]].\n\n===Errors===\n* When everyone is saying goodbye to Ash and Pikachu outside the plane, {{p|Metang}}\'s horn is colored blue instead of gray.\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n<!--{{Epilang|color=90BDDC|bordercolor=F1912B\n}}-->\n{{-}}\n<!-- fill in the title links with dub titles only -->\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=SM145 |\n<!--prevtitle= |-->\nnextcode=SS001 |\n<!--nexttitle= |-->\nseries=Sun & Moon series |\ncolorscheme=Alola}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1085}}\n[[Category:Sun & Moon series episodes|146]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Aya Matsui]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded and directed by Daiki Tomiyasu]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Daiki Tomiyasu]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Daiki Tomiyasu]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Rei Yamazaki]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Maiko Katsuki]]\n[[Category:Episodes by multiple animation directors]]\n[[Category:Milestone episodes]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a Mythical Pokémon appears]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a Legendary Pokémon appears]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a main character leaves the group]]\n\n[[de:Arigatō Alola!
