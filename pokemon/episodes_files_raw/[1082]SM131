It first aired in Japan on July 21, 2019 and is scheduled to air in the United States on November 23, 2019.\n{{spoilers}}\n<!--\n==Blurb==\nOfficial Blurb from Pokémon.com goes here, with source link-->\n<!--Please do not alter the blurb to fix any errors, they are meant to be presented as they are on the official site.-->\n\n==Plot==\nWhile his friends offer him support, {{an|Sophocles}} nervously waits for his match against [[Mina]] to start. Following {{Ash}}\'s suggestion, Sophocles settles down after taking some deep breaths. {{an|Lillie}} asks her older brother {{an|Gladion}} to not hold back during their match, declaring that she wants to demonstrate [[Snowy]]\'s full power, and Gladion agrees. Meanwhile, [[Jessie]] imagines her [[Manalo Conference]] victory speech while [[James]] dozes off, much to her displeasure.\n\nOnce Sophocles\'s match begins, his {{TP|Sophocles|Vikavolt}} pursues Mina\'s {{p|Ribombee}} through the sky. Vikavolt uses {{m|Zap Cannon}}, but Ribombee easily dodges it. After a quick dive and change of direction, Ribombee throws a series of {{m|Pollen Puff}}s and strikes Vikavolt several times. After the bombardment, Ribombee tosses Vikavolt into the battlefield with {{m|Psychic}}. Vikavolt quickly recovers and uses another Zap Cannon, but Ribombee again dodges it. In its moment of disorientation, Vikavolt zips behind and grabs a hold of Ribombee with its mandibles. With its opponent immobilized, Vikavolt defeats it with a close-range {{m|Signal Beam}}. [[Nanu]] makes the official ruling and declares Sophocles the winner.\n[[File:SM131 Jessie VS James.png|thumb|left|250px|Jessie facing James]]\nJessie and James\'s match begins, with them going by "Jessina" and "Jamesio", respectively. Once Nanu signals for the sixth match to begin, [[James\'s Mareanie]] uses {{m|Spike Cannon}}, but {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} deflects the move. James orders Mareanie to use {{m|Sludge Bomb}}, but Wobbuffet simply reflects the attack back with {{m|Mirror Coat}}. Wobbuffet\'s defenses continue to prevent any damage from being inflicted on it, and the battle goes nowhere. James realizes that the match will continue on indefinitely like this, so he whispers to Mareanie to pretend to be incapacitated. However, when Mareanie turns to him, James looks into her eyes and realizes that she wants to battle properly for him. He then decides to take the battle just as seriously and orders Mareanie to use Spike Cannon. Wobbuffet manages to use {{m|Counter}} in time, but Mareanie\'s continued onslaught of attacks eventually causes the defensive barrier to weaken. In a massive explosion, Wobbuffet is thrown into the air and knocked out, giving James the win, much to Jessie\'s dismay.\n[[File:SM131 Kiawe VS Acerola.png|thumb|250px|Kiawe facing Acerola]]\nNext, {{an|Kiawe}} and [[Acerola]] call out their Pokémon, {{TP|Kiawe|Marowak}} and {{p|Gengar|Rapooh}}, respectively. Acerola orders Rapooh to use {{m|Shadow Ball}}, though the attack is destroyed by Marowak\'s {{m|Bonemerang}}. Rapooh then uses {{m|Shadow Punch}}, but Marowak manages to block it with {{m|Shadow Bone}}. Rapooh retaliates with another Shadow Punch, which strikes Marowak, who is then immobilized by Rapooh\'s {{a|Cursed Body}} [[Ability]]. Acerola orders Rapooh to use {{m|Thief}}, and it promptly steals Marowak\'s bone club, instantly limiting Marowak\'s move-set. Rapooh takes the opportunity to lash Marowak with a Shadow Ball-Shadow Punch combination. As Rapooh readies another Shadow Punch, Marowak is freed from Cursed Body and slams into its opponent with {{m|Iron Head}}. The impact winds Rapooh, who then absorbs Marowak into its body. However, Marowak emerges from Rapooh\'s body with its bone club in hand. Acerola orders another Shadow Ball, but Marowak retaliates, batting the Shadow Ball back at Rapooh before striking it with Shadow Bone, defeating it and allowing Kiawe to advance to the next round.\n\nThe announcer excitedly declares that next up is a sibling showdown between Gladion and Lillie. {{an|Lusamine}}, with pom poms in hand, and her staff cheer Lillie on, much to Lillie\'s embarrassment. Lillie has Snowy summon a {{m|Hail}}, instantly changing the battle conditions to suit Snowy\'s {{t|Ice}} typing. Gladion quickly orders {{TP|Gladion|Umbreon}} to attack with {{m|Dark Pulse}} though Snowy is uninjured as she hid amongst the growing frost. Gladion is mildly impressed by Snowy\'s {{a|Snow Cloak}} Ability, admitting that Lillie is growing as a {{pkmn|Trainer}}. He orders a Shadow Ball, which smashes through Snowy’s {{m|Aurora Veil}} defenses and strikes its target. As the Hail conditions fade, Lillie decides for a more drastic measure, her [[Z-Move]]. Lillie executes her Z-Pose perfectly and Snowy lashes Umbreon with {{m|Subzero Slammer}}. Umbreon, however, emerges fine and knocks Snowy out with a super effective {{m|Iron Tail}}. As Lillie comforts Snowy in her arms, Hapu announces that Gladion is the winner. Lusamine is particularly proud of her two children, admitting she wishes her husband [[Mohn]] could be there to watch.\n\nThat night, the round two match ups are revealed on the [[Pokémon Center]] screen as: Gladion versus Jamesio, Ash and [[Hau]], Kiawe is up against Sophocles while [[Guzma]] will battle {{an|Lana}}. Hau is particularly excited by the match up, with his {{p|Decidueye}} and [[Ash\'s Rowlet]] exchanging a series of fighting words. Rowlet is so stirred up that it flies out of the Center to call for [[Toucannon\'s flock|its family]]. As it soars, it notices a {{pkmn2|wild}} {{p|Wingull}} passing by and promptly orders it to deliver the all-important message.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
