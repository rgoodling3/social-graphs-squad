It first aired in Japan on January 13, 2019 and in the United States on May 4, 2019.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/22_12-thats-some-spicy-island-research/-->\n<i>The Pokémon School class is visiting Poni Island, and everyone is excited about their upcoming research projects. Ash wants to compete in his fourth grand trial, but because the island currently has no kahuna, he plans to challenge Tapu Fini instead! While searching for the Island Guardian, he meets a Trainer named Hapu, who impresses our hero with her tenacity and battling skills. Although Hapu doesn’t share Ash’s enthusiasm, she respects his determination. And when Team Skull tries to capture a group of Oricorio, she jumps into the fray and defeats the hapless trio with just one hit!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAs [[Hapu]] and her {{p|Golurk}} tend to her {{wp|radish}} farm and feed a trio of {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Oricorio|Sensu Style}} {{p|Oricorio}}, {{an|Professor Kukui}}, {{Ash}}, and {{ashcl}} arrive at the [[Seafolk Village]] port on [[Poni Island]] and meet up with [[Nurse Joy]], who will be supervising them for the next few days. Kukui brings everyone\'s attention to their personal research projects and asks them to clarify their chosen topics. {{an|Sophocles}} says that he hopes to [[Evolution|evolve]] his {{TP|Sophocles|Charjabug}} at [[Vast Poni Canyon]], {{an|Kiawe}} wants to continue {{pkmn|training}}, {{an|Mallow}} is set on sourcing some Poni radishes for a new dish for [[Aina\'s Kitchen]] menu, {{an|Lana}} wishes to catch up with [[Ida]], {{an|Lillie}} expresses her plans to study Poni Island\'s Pokémon, and Ash wants to challenge the Poni Island [[Island challenge|grand trial]]. Upon hearing Ash\'s intentions, Kukui informs him that Poni Island doesn\'t have a grand trial because there is currently no [[Island Kahuna]]. Sophocles explains that the former Kahuna recently retired due to his old age. Kukui offers Ash a chance to battle him, but Ash instead decides that he will take on {{DL|Guardian deities (anime)|Tapu Fini}}. Afterwards, Kukui boards the ship back to [[Melemele Island]].\n\nAsh and the others set off to explore Poni Island and reach the [[Ancient Poni Path]]. {{Rotom}} spots a Golurk working the fields and scans it into its database. Mallow is thrilled to see Golurk harvest a Poni radish, which is known for their extreme length. Ash decides to help, and as he prepares to climb the picket fence, he hears a voice telling him to stay out before it commands Golurk to use {{m|Flash Cannon}}. The attack sends Ash and {{AP|Pikachu}} hurtling away, but {{TP|Mallow|Tsareena}} manages to stop their momentum. Hapu reveals herself to the group and challenges them, assuming they are radish thieves. Ash accepts the challenge and has Pikachu use {{m|Quick Attack}}. However, Hapu says Quick Attack won\'t work because of Golurk\'s {{t|Ghost}} type. However, Pikachu strikes Golurk\'s leg with {{m|Iron Tail}}, causing the giant Pokemon to fall into a kneeling position. Hapu takes note of Ash\'s strategy and admits that it was clever under her breath. Ash has Pikachu go in for another Quick Attack and Iron Tail combination, but Golurk grabs Pikachu\'s tail and slams him into the ground. Pikachu is then knocked out by Golurk\'s {{m|High Horsepower}}. Hapu warns Ash\'s group to not return and steal her crops before walking off with Golurk and her {{p|Mudsdale}}.\n\nAsh and his friends return to the [[Pokémon Center]], and Pikachu makes a swift recovery thanks to its treatment. Joy overhears Ash and Kiawe\'s conversation about the Golurk {{pkmn|Trainer}} they met, and she adds that the girl\'s name is Hapu. Nurse Joy explains that Hapu prefers to live alone, and while her parents live close by, she is deeply attached to her grandfather [[Sofu]]\'s land. Kiawe recognizes the name and claims that [[Kiawe\'s grandfather|his grandfather]] was friends with Sofu. Joy adds that Hapu grew up around adults, and this contributed to her stubborn determination to win. Lillie is still unsure as to why they were called radish thieves, and Joy replies that Hapu has recently been struggling with a series of thefts. Mallow is keen to taste some Poni radish, and luckily Joy has some remaining. Everyone takes a bite, but Ash, Kiawe, Sophocles, and Lillie finds it too spicy, while Lana, Mallow, and Tsareena enjoy the taste. Then, {{TP|Kiawe|Marowak}} takes a bite and finds it tolerable, much to Kiawe\'s surprise. The rest of the Pokémon try the radish and all but [[Sandy]] and Charjabug finds the radish too spicy. Joy admits the radishes are an acquired taste, but Hapu\'s produce is particularly good. Meanwhile on Hapu\'s property, Hapu contemplates Ash\'s odd decision to send out Pikachu against her Golurk.\n\nSoon, Ash and his friends split up to do their own activities; Lana is going [[fishing]] before catching up with Ida, Lillie and Mallow decide to explore the Seafolk Village markets, Kiawe and Sophocles decide to do more training while Ash is set on locating Tapu Fini. Hapu looks out at the ocean and sets off on her Golurk to do a patrol after noticing that the sea is particularly still. Ash soon reaches [[Poni Beach]], hoping to find Tapu Fini, but he instead finds a group of Oricorio. Suddenly, someone throws out a radish on a string and it immediately attracts one of the Oricorio. The [[Team Skull]] trio, [[Rapp]], [[Tupp]] and [[Zipp]], are then revealed to be the culprits and have already netted themselves several Oricorio. Tupp plans to have the Oricorio perform as dancers to the entrance of Team Skull Paradise. The trio is surprised to see Ash and go on to explain that they are on Poni Island to create Team Skull\'s Paradise. Tupp declines Ash\'s demands and the trio then sends out their {{p|Salandit}}, {{p|Zubat}}, and {{p|Garbodor}} against Pikachu.\n\nHapu spots the confrontation from the air and intervenes before things get heated. She then spots some of her stolen radish and turns to Ash for answers. Ash proclaims his innocence and explains that Team Skull were trying to catch the Oricorio. Hapu then notices the loot bag and tells Team Skull that they are in need of punishment. Tupp and his teammates remain defiant and belittle Hapu for her short stature. Hapu then calls on Mudsdale for assistance and its arrivals causes Team Skull\'s Pokémon to walk backwards. Ash insists that it is his battle, but Hapu cuts him off and declares that she is capable of handling the situation on her own. The Skull trio command their Pokémon to attack Mudsdale. The direct hits instead help activate Mudsdale\'s {{a|Stamina}} [[Ability]], which increases its {{DL|Statistic|Defense|defenses}}. Mudsdale\'s High Horsepower attack defeats the Team Skull trio in one blow. Suddenly, the Team Skull trio\'s boss, Admin [[Plumeria]], arrives on the scene. She is unimpressed when Tupp admits that they were trying to capture the Oricorio to have them dance at the Team Skull Paradise. Zipp, Tupp, and Rapp follow after Plumeria and ignore Hapu entirely.\n\nAsh releases the Oricorio from the loot bag, and the [[wild Pokémon]] are happy to be free and reunited. Hapu apologizes for mistaking Ash for a radish thief and asks for his forgiveness. Ash is not fussed and then asks Hapu for a battle. Hapu, however, abruptly declines and she recalls Mudsdale before heading for home. Ash declares that he won\'t give up on the rematch, causing Hapu to consider it as she soars away. Overnight, Ash and his classmates return to the Pokémon Center for a meal prepared by Nurse Joy.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
