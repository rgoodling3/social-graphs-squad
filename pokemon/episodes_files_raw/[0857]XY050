The Dance for Tomorrow!!\'\') is the 50th episode of the {{series|XY}}, and the 849th episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It first aired in Japan on November 13, 2014 and in the United States on February 7, 2015 as the first episode of the eighteenth season, \'\'[[S18|Pokémon the Series: XY Kalos Quest]]\'\'.\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/18_01-pathways-to-performance-partnering/-->\n<i>As our heroes head to Coumarine City, a lunchtime squabble between Clemont\'s Chespin and Serena\'s Pancham gets out of hand when they bump into a Smoochum and Farfetch\'d. Their Trainer, Nini, is planning to enter her first Pokémon Showcase, just like Serena. The two girls decide to show each other their performances and get feedback from Ash, Clemont, and Bonnie as well, but they have an unexpected audience...\n\nTeam Rocket is lurking nearby, and Jessie decides she just has to have Nini\'s Smoochum as her Pokémon Showcase partner. She disguises herself as a choreographer and coaxes all the dancing Pokémon into a small performance space...and then Team Rocket\'s balloon takes off with them! Chespin and Pancham finally decide to work together and discover they\'re a pretty good team, sending the villains blasting off again. Nini and Serena say their goodbyes and promise to meet in the Pokémon Showcase as rivals!</i>\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode starts with {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} eating their lunchtime snack. While they\'re eating, {{an|Serena}} comes by with [[Poké Puff]]s, but with only crumbs left, since {{TP|Clemont|Chespin}} ate them all. {{TP|Serena|Pancham}} becomes angry, and starts fighting with Chespin which {{an|Clemont}} and Serena try to end. However, the two Pokémon continue fighting across the field.\n\nWe eventually see [[Nini|a girl]]\'s {{p|Smoochum}} and her crying {{p|Farfetch\'d}}. The girl then asks what Clemont and Serena are doing to her Pokémon, and asks if those "ill-mannered" Pokémon are theirs, and that Chespin and Pancham were using {{m|Tackle}} for no reason. Clemont and Serena tell Chespin and Pancham that they need to apologize. Ash joins in and apologizes too. The girl accepts their apologies and reveals she is practicing for a [[Pokémon Showcase]], which Serena is participating as well. It will be their first time doing it.\n\nThe girl then asks Serena to watch her performance, but Serena replies saying she doesn\'t know enough to judge someone\'s performance. The girl tells Serena all she has to do is give an opinion, she doesn\'t need professional judging skills.\n\nThe scene cuts and the girl has her Smoochum use {{m|Powder Snow}}. Then, Farfetch\'d retrieves its stick and clears out the Powder Snow. Smoochum uses {{m|Heart Stamp}}, and then Farfetch\'d uses {{m|Fury Cutter}} to cut the Heart Stamp into multiple hearts, concluding the performance. The group applaud and the girl asks if there is anything about the performance that could use fixing. Serena suggests she could coordinate her dance a bit more. Ash suggests a flashier Heart Stamp. She requests Serena to show her her performance. Though Serena is not ready, {{an|Bonnie}} wants to see it alongside Clemont. Ash and {{AP|Pikachu}} agree. When Serena asks if {{TP|Serena|Fennekin}} and Pancham are ready, Chespin jumps in to kick Pancham. Bonnie tries to break up the fight along with Pikachu, when it\'s revealed Chespin wants to perform too.\n\nClemont brings out his "Only Lonely Dancing Robo-Partner," and powers it on to give Chespin a partner. The invention ends up hurting Chespin, and Bonnie asks Clemont to turn it off, but Clemont fails to find the off button. The invention eventually blows up on everyone.\n\nThe scene cuts, as Ash wishes good luck to Serena. Serena starts off her showcase with Fennekin using {{m|Flamethrower}} as Pancham dangerously spins through the Flamethrower. Ash and friends aren\'t the only ones watching, as we see {{TRT}} off in the distance. Jessie looks as Smoochum\'s lips which she thinks are beautiful, and decides to steal Smoochum to win the showcase. James asks why Jessie isn\'t planning to steal Pikachu, Jessie says she is willing to do that \'\'after\'\' stealing Smoochum, as stealing Smoochum could help her gain the title "Kalos Queen".\n\nSerena\'s act continues, and Fennekin uses Flamethrower once again around the purple light in the sky. This ends her performance, and everyone comments saying they loved the act. The girl says Pancham\'s acrobatics didn\'t fit with the performance—it didn\'t match Fennekin\'s part of the performance. Smoochum falls in love with Pancham and Pancham tries to avoid Smoochum. It is suggested that Pancham and Smoochum (described as the perfect couple) should dance together, so they do so. When the dance is over, everyone claps. The girl then asks if Serena wants to trade Pancham for one of her Pokémon. However, Serena says she is unwilling to trade Pancham as it is the first Pokémon she caught and Pancham will be going to be Serena\'s showcase partner. The girl\'s name is now revealed to be Nini.\n\nTeam Rocket arrive, disguised, and {{an|James}} introduces {{an|Jessie}} as La Grande Dame Brûlée, cream of the choreographer crop. Nini asks if they can help them, but James says La Grande Dame Brûlée is "anything but cheap", but Jessie says they will help for free. The scene cuts and Jessie and James actually \'\'help\'\' Nini and Serena. Jessie tells the Pokémon to lift their left and right legs. She then tells them to shift their bodies left and right. Jessie and James then inflate a balloon and have the Pokémon go inside there, that way their movements will be more economical. Rather than adjust their movements, Jessie just uses the balloon to \'\'steal\'\' the Pokémon. Serena mentions she thought they were having a lesson, then La Grande Dame Brûlée reveals herself to be Jessie in disguise. Nini asks for an explanation who Team Rocket is, and Clemont tells Nini they\'re a team who attempts stealing Pokémon.\n\nTeam Rocket start their getaway and the true fight begins. The gang tries to catch up with them, but {{MTR}} throws a smoke bomb at them and run away. Ash sends out {{TP|Ash|Fletchinder}} to track Team Rocket\'s balloon. At Team Rocket\'s balloon, the Pokémon are making movements from inside to distract Team Rocket. The balloon they are trapped in gets detached from Team Rocket\'s hot-air balloon, and ends up in a forest. When the balloon opens, Chespin and Pancham start fighting again, but James\'s {{TP|James|Inkay}} finds the Pokémon. Chespin and Pancham stand in front of the other Pokémon to defend them, still fighting. James tells Inkay to use {{m|Psybeam}}. This hits Smoochum and Farfetch\'d. Jessie has {{TP|Jessie|Pumpkaboo}} use {{m|Shadow Ball}}. Fennekin tries to counter with Flamethrower. Everyone but Chespin and Pancham are down, Pancham has a flashback of Serena saying "Don\'t you remember you\'re supposed to be friends?! Now make up!". Chespin has a flashback of Clemont saying "Hey, all you\'re doing is just being plain mean to each other. Come on!". The two become quick friends again as Jessie tells Pumpkaboo to use {{m|Dark Pulse}}, as Chespin and Pancham make a last-second dodge.\n\nPumpkaboo gets hit with attacks, and James gets Inkay to use Tackle. Inkay dodges and James tells Inkay to use Psybeam. Pumpkaboo uses {{m|Leech Seed}}, and Chespin\'s vine counterattacks it. Ash, Pikachu, Bonnie, Serena, Clemont, and Nini arrive in on the action, and everyone reclaims their Pokémon while Clemont asks how Chespin and Pancham are doing. Jessie commands Pumpkaboo to use Shadow Ball at the group, which they dodge. Pancham and Chespin are revealed to everyone to have become friends again. After Pancham and Chespin play their part, Ash tells Pikachu to use Thunderbolt sending Team Rocket blasting off again. Jessie complains about "her cute little Smoochum-woochum" being gone from her possession and James comments that behavior does not fit a queen, and Meowth comments "in her dreams." Jessie angrily comments that she is not to give up trying to become Kalos Queen, and Meowth says her performance throne is the cheapest.\n\nOnce that is over, Pancham and Chespin continue fighting, which, from Ash\'s point of view, proves they\'re great friends.\n\nAt evening, Serena and Nini say goodbye to each other. Serena and Nini plan to be performance rivals, and Nini claims that she\'ll beat Serena. Nini then walks away and tells everyone to keep in touch with her. With a new friend and rival for Serena, Ash\'s journey continues.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
