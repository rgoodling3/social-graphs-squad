It\'s found by a friendly Turtwig who defends Pikachu from Team Rocket, but mistakes Ash for a foe as well! During this commotion, Ash and Pikachu are hit by Sleep Power from a nearby Oddish. Turtwig takes this opportunity to grab Pikachu and run off into the forest. Turtwig\'s friend Clara, a kind old lady, happens upon the scene and explains to our heroes that Turtwig is the leader of the local Pokémon. Looks like this time it\'s taking its responsibilities a little too seriously!\n\nAsh finds Turtwig and explains that he and Pikachu are really best friends, though Turtwig doesn\'t believe a word of it until Pikachu confirms Ash\'s story. Now that everyone is on friendly terms, it\'s time for a lovely outdoor meal at Clara\'s lakeside home. However, nobody realizes that Team Rocket\'s Magikarp submarine is lurking in the water. The villains snatch Turtwig and Pikachu, but Ash and Piplup pursue them and Pikachu and Turtwig are soon free.\n\nThat\'s not enough to stop Team Rocket, of course. They come back for another kidnap attempt, only to be defeated by Pikachu. Ash and his friends then prepare to leave, but Turtwig wants to come along—after a battle with Ash, that is. Pikachu wins the match, which means Turtwig is now the newest member of the team!</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} give chase as {{TRT}} make a [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|balloon]] getaway with {{AP|Pikachu}} locked in a cage. Ash summons {{AP|Starly}} to attack the rope holding Pikachu\'s cage. [[James]] sends out {{TP|James|Carnivine}}, but it latches onto him as usual. [[Jessie]] kicks Carnivine, and the force pushes the balloon down, causing Starly to accidentally pop the balloon. The balloon crashes near a lake, surprising a nearby {{p|Turtwig}}, who finds Pikachu and opens up the cage. Carnivine attacks and Turtwig steps up to protect Pikachu. Turtwig immediately attacks Carnivine with a powerful {{m|Tackle}}, sending Team Rocket flying.\n\nAsh and the others soon catch up to Pikachu, and Turtwig runs up to defend Pikachu, assuming that they are hostile. {{an|Dawn}} steps up to catch Turtwig by sending {{TP|Dawn|Piplup}}, attacking with {{m|Peck}}. Turtwig fires off a {{m|Razor Leaf}}, but Piplup ducks low to the ground and dodges behind a rock. The attack hits a nearby bush, injuring a {{pkmn2|wild}} {{p|Oddish}} who stumbles out and uses {{m|Sleep Powder}} near Pikachu. Ash rushes in to save Pikachu, though both take the attack, falling {{status|asleep}}. Turtwig quickly grabs Pikachu and runs off. Dawn and {{an|Brock}} attempt to pursue, but they run into an elderly woman named [[Clara]]. She takes them to her cabin and awakens Ash. She informs the others that Turtwig is a friend and a protector of the community. She recalled finding it in the area, feeding it and nursing it back to health, which prompted it to stick around. It quickly became a leader in the community.\n\nTurtwig meanwhile gives Pikachu a piece of fruit. It breaks up a fight between a {{p|Geodude}} and a {{p|Mankey}}, giving both of them enough fruit to settle the matter. Ash heads out and finds Pikachu, and Turtwig quickly tackles Ash. Pikachu quickly tells Turtwig that Ash is friendly, and Turtwig quickly changes tone, ashamed at itself. Nearby, an injured {{p|Linoone}} appears. Dawn checks her [[Pokédex]] while Ash rushes to treat it. They take it back to Clara, where Brock treats it with herbs. Team Rocket surveys the group from their Magikarp submarine in the lake.\n\nBrock cooks lunch for everyone, including the {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. Linoone quickly finishes its food, and Turtwig gives Linoone its food portion. Ash applauds Turtwig, and Ash gives Turtwig another serving. Turtwig is so ecstatic that it quickly latches onto Ash\'s head in a manner similar to James\'s Carnivine, and Clara supports the fact that Turtwig is drawn to Ash. Clara has also experienced Turtwig\'s affection, but she manages to get Turtwig latched onto a stick instead of her head. Suddenly, Turtwig and Pikachu are captured in a glass capsule, pulling them back to Team Rocket\'s submarine. The trio quickly flees, so Ash jumps into the water after them, and Dawn sends out Piplup to help. Clara realizes that Team Rocket might be using the river to escape, so she and the others follow along the shore. Team Rocket notices Ash following and grabbing onto the capsule. They pedal faster to try and dislodge Ash, taking the capsule underwater. Turtwig tries to break the glass with Tackle, though Pikachu\'s {{m|Iron Tail}} and {{m|Thunderbolt}} breaks the capsule and also electrifies everyone around, both Team Rocket and Ash. Meanwhile, Clara stops running due to fatigue, but Ash and the Pokémon surface nearby. Turtwig is somewhat exhausted, though uses {{m|Synthesis}} to heal up. Meanwhile, Team Rocket surfaces and tries another attempt to capture Turtwig. They order {{TP|Jessie|Seviper}} and Carnivine to attack with {{m|Poison Tail}} and {{m|Bite}}, but Turtwig rushes up to attack Seviper with Tackle before using Bite to send Carnivine flying. As Carnivine and Seviper charge forward to attack, Pikachu uses {{m|Volt Tackle}} to send Team Rocket blasting off.\n\nEveryone prepares to depart Clara\'s place, but Clara knows Turtwig wants to go. Turtwig rushes over and stops Ash, asking to go along, although it demands a battle. Ash obliges and sends Pikachu to face off against Turtwig. As Turtwig charges, Pikachu knocks it down with {{m|Quick Attack}}. Turtwig tries a Razor Leaf, but Pikachu dodges. Turtwig quickly follows up with Tackle, catching Pikachu off guard. Turtwig rushes forward again. Though Pikachu jumps up to dodge, so Turtwig bites onto Pikachu\'s tail, bringing him down. Pikachu tries to shake it off, but Turtwig is holding on tight. Ash orders Pikachu to use Iron Tail on a tree to remove Turtwig. It works, and Pikachu follows up with Thunderbolt, paralyzing Turtwig. Ash promptly throws a {{i|Poké Ball}}, and Turtwig goes inside. After a few moments, the Ball stops shaking, making the catch a success. With Ash acquiring {{AP|Turtwig}}, they continue to [[Jubilife City]].\n\n==Major events==\n* [[James\'s Carnivine]] is revealed to know {{m|Bullet Seed}}.\n* {{Ash}} catches a {{AP|Turtwig}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n* [[Ash\'s Turtwig]]\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Dawn}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Clara]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Mime Jr.}} ({{OP|James|Mime Jr.}})\n* {{p|Piplup}} ({{OP|Dawn|Piplup}})\n* {{p|Starly}} ({{OP|Ash|Starly}})\n* {{p|Turtwig}} ({{OP|Ash|Turtwig}}; new)\n* {{p|Seviper}} ({{OP|Jessie|Seviper}})\n* {{p|Carnivine}} ({{OP|James|Carnivine}})\n* {{p|Oddish}}\n* {{p|Mankey}}\n* {{p|Geodude}}\n* {{p|Linoone}}\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:DP005 senryuu.jpg|thumb|200px|Pokémon senryū]]\n* Music from \'\'[[M06|Jirachi: Wish Maker]]\'\' is used as background music.\n* The next episode preview was followed by a preview for \'\'[[The Mastermind of Mirage Pokémon]]\'\'.\n* [[Professor Oak\'s Big Pokémon Encyclopedia]]: [[Pokémon Trainer]]s\n** Pokémon senryū: さあ10さい\u3000ぼくもわたしも\u3000トレーナー \'\'Sā jussai, boku mo watashi mo torēnā.\'\' "Ah, the age 10; we will all be {{pkmn|Trainer}}s."\n* The dub title is a play off artist {{wp|Will Smith}}\'s song \'\'{{wp|Gettin\' Jiggy wit It}}\'\'.\n** Coincidentally, the {{wp|Powerpuff Girls}} cartoon series also has an episode titled \'\'Gettin\' Twiggy With It\'\'.\n* The capture of {{AP|Turtwig}} is similar to the capture of {{AP|Bulbasaur}}; both previously "belonged" to another person, they both protect or keep the peace in that area, and Ash caught it with {{AP|Pikachu}} after {{TRT}} attacked.\n\n===Errors===\n* On the DVD, the credits don\'t appear in {{so|Diamond & Pearl|the opening}} unlike other episodes.\n* In the Hindi dub, Turtwig was mispronounced as Turtling once.\n\n===Dub edits===\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FCC|bordercolor=99F\n|zh_cmn={{tt|收服草苗龜吧！|Get Turtwig!}}\n|cs={{tt|Moje hlava není ke kousání|My Head\'s Not for Biting}}\n|da={{tt|Goddag til Turtwig|Hello Turtwig}}\n|nl={{tt|Een Driftige Aanwinst!|A Hasty Gain!}}\n|fi={{tt|Konnankoukkuja|Mischiefs}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Une drôle de preuve d\'amour !|A weird demonstration of love!}}\n|de={{tt|Klein, aber bärenstark!|Small but husky!}}\n|he={{tt|משתוללים בין העצים|Raving between the trees}}\n|hi=ऐश को मिला नया दोस्त! {{tt|\'\'Ash ko mila naya dost!\'\'|Ash got a new friend!}}{{tt|*|Disney XD dub}}\n|it={{tt|Un Pokémon generoso|A generous Pokémon}} & {{tt|Simpatia a prima vista|Liking at first sight}} <!--Don\'t Delete anything here, Italian episodes are divided into two parts, which have different titles-->\n|no={{tt|Turtwig gjør entré|Turtwig makes an entrance}}\n|pl={{tt|Dogadajmy się|Let\'s come to understanding}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Engalhado em Confusões!|Twigged in Troubles!}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Aprender a Lição!|Learn the Lesson!}}\n|ru={{tt|С Тортвигом навсегда!|With Turtwig forever!}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Nuevos Amigos!|New Friends!}}\'\'\'\n|es_eu={{tt|Comprendiendo a Turwig|Understanding Turtwig}}\n|sv={{tt|Ett kvistigt problem!|A knotty problem!}}\n|ro={{tt|La Drum cu Turtwig|On the Road with Turtwig}}\n|th={{tt|จับนาเอโทรุได้แล้ว!|Get Naetle!}}\n|ko={{tt|모부기 넌 내꺼야|Turtwig You\'re Mine}}\n}}\n\n\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=DP004 |\nprevtitle=Dawn Of A New Era! |\nnextcode=DP006 |\nnexttitle=Different Strokes for Different Blokes |\nseries=Diamond & Pearl series |\ncolorscheme=Sinnoh}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0471}}\n[[Category:Diamond & Pearl series episodes|005]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Shinzō Fujita]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Masaru Koyama]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Masahiko Watanabe]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Izumi Shimura]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a main character obtains a new Pokémon]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Ash]]\n\n[[de:Klein, aber bärenstark!]]\n[[es:EP474]]\n[[fr:DP005]]\n[[it:DP005]]\n[[ja:DP編第5話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 钻石＆珍珠 第5集]]'}
