It first aired in Japan on July 18, 2002 and in the United States on July 26, 2003.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/05_47-lapras-of-luxury/-->\n<i>Ash and friends return to New Bark Town, but before Ash is able to register for the Johto League Championship, Professor Elm sends him on an errand to retrieve a Pokémon egg from a nearby marine Pokémon laboratory. At the laboratory, Ash and friends meet up with a young researcher who uses the supersonic waves from a Lanturn to detect the singing voices of traveling Lapras. She hands an egg over to Ash, asking that he deliver it to Professor Elm. When a school of Lapras arrive, one of them begins calling out to Ash. It turns out that this is in fact the very same Lapras that Ash parted ways with in the Orange Islands. Their reunion is cut short when Team Rocket arrives and kidnaps this Lapras along with all of its friends. Unsurprisingly, Team Rocket fails miserably, but when their Gyarados submarine is caught up in a whirlpool, it drags Ash\'s Lapras\'s mother and the leader of the Lapras along with it. The researcher\'s equipment cannot detect the missing Lapras over the roar of the whirlpool, but magically Ash\'s Lapras and its mother are able to communicate through Lapras-song, allowing Ash\'s Lapras to find its missing peers.</i>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} are returning to [[New Bark Town]], but before Ash is able to get there to register for the {{DL|Silver Conference|Johto League Championship}}, [[Professor Elm]] sends him on an errand to retrieve a [[Pokémon Egg]] at the [[Marine Pokémon Laboratory]]. At the laboratory, the group meets a young researcher who is in a hurry. As she rushes passed them, {{an|Brock}}\'s heart is sent aflutter and he chases after the woman, with his friends following behind. The researchers rushes to a pier and orders her waiting {{p|Lanturn}} to use {{m|Supersonic}}. The sonar waves echo throughout the water, and the researcher watches intently for any responses. Brock suddenly arrives, but the researcher hushes him so that she can concentrate on her fieldwork. Suddenly the computer picks up the singing voices of traveling {{p|Lapras}}. The Lapras emerge from the water much to the delight of the group and the researcher. \n\nAs Ash watches a herd of Lapras from shore, two adults separate from it, one of which approaches Ash. Ash realizes it\'s his old buddy, his {{AP|Lapras}} that he {{pkmn2|caught}} in the [[Orange Archipelago|Orange Islands]], and {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Lapras|its mother}}. The researcher is astounded and introduces herself as [[Naomi]], a marine biologist and director of the Marine Laboratory. She reveals that Professor Elm told her that Ash would be coming to retrieve the Pokémon Egg. She takes everyone back to the lab, where she discusses Lapras migration. Naomi says that Lapras travel routes appears to be linked water temperature and season. She declares that the key to solving the mystery is in Lapras\' voice. Then Naomi plays the traveling song that Lapras sing when they migrate, and explains that her Lanturn\'s Supersonic can actually pinpoint their location. Meanwhile, {{TRT}} spies on the Lapras herd from their [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|Gyarados submarine]]. [[James]] suggests they capture the Lapras and rent them out as water taxi services. [[Jessie]] is thrilled with the money making idea and declares full scheme ahead.\n\nLater, Naomi shows the group the green colored Egg and explains that it was rescued from a group of [[Pokémon poacher]]s, where it was stolen from the Pokémon Preserve on [[Mt. Silver]]. She reveals that Professor Elm, who is the advisor of the Johto League Pokémon Preservation Council, will know exactly what to do with the Egg. Meanwhile, Lapras calls out for Ash to play with it. {{an|Misty}} and the others urge Ash to catch up with it, and so he leaps from Naomi’s balcony down to the shore before him and {{AP|Pikachu}} hop aboard Lapras. The trio enjoy a fun-filled afternoon surfing over the ocean waves. By night, Ash commends Lapras on its growth and increased power. Ash shows Lapras his eight [[Johto League]] [[Badge]]s, however the reunion is cut short when Team Rocket net Lapras\'s herd.\n\nThe Lapras cries also alert Naomi and the others, so they rush outside to examine the scene. Team Rocket\'s sub emerges from the water, and the trio performs their {{motto}}. As Ash and Lapras surf into view, James sends out {{TP|James|Weezing}} for a {{m|Smokescreen}}. The acrid smoke leaves Ash coughing and allows Team Rocket to make a getaway with their hauled catch. Soon enough Lapras and Ash chase after the Rocket sub as Naomi urges Brock and Misty inside her own submarine. Team Rocket uses their secret booster weapons to bolster their speed, leaving Ash and the others in their wake. Noami pulls up beside Ash and calls for him to enter the sub while they follow after his Lapras.\n\nTeam Rocket is relieved that they have escaped Ash and the others. Suddenly something rocks their Gyarados submarine. {{MTR}} points to the viewing screen and the Rocket trio watch in horror as the Lapras have gnawed through the capture net and making an escape. Jessie orders an emergency resurfacing to avoid any more losses. However, Jessie notices that there seems to be a significant lag and Meowth is unable to explain why. James suddenly spots a wall of riptides, but before they can act, Team Rocket and some of the Lapras are swept into the strong currents. Soon enough, Naomi’s sub follows Ash’s Lapras to the remaining herd. Naomi notices that a couple of Lapras are missing, Brock worries that the two missing Lapras might be caught in the rip. Ash\'s Lapras tells the herd to follow, saying it has heard something, but Naomi doesn\'t detect anything within the radar\'s range. The herd communicates with each other to guide their movements and fight the strong current, while signaling for the missing two. Naomi suddenly gets something on her radar: the two missing Lapras replying to the herd\'s travel song. Naomi is amazed, realizing that they can distinguish the wordings of their song even when there is so much background noise and they can hear the songs of their friends from miles away, farther than radar can detect. Naomi notices that they are headed for a nearby island.\n\nOn the island, Team Rocket is exhausted but still have the two Lapras in the net. The herd suddenly appears out of the water and Naomi\'s submarine also resurfaces. But before they can retrieve the two missing Lapras, Jessie and James sends out {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}} and Weezing. Brock chooses to send out {{TP|Brock|Crobat}} to battle against Team Rocket. He orders Crobat to use {{m|Sonic Boom}} which hits Weezing and Arbok. As Naomi and Misty strive to release the two, before doing so, Meowth rushes in to stop them with his claws. Though Ash has Pikachu knock Meowth out of the way with a {{m|Quick Attack}}. Ash, Misty, and Naomi release the two and Lapras and its mom are happy to be reunited again. Arbok and Weezing were ready to attack, but they’re stopped by the herd of Lapras, as they, along with their leader use {{m|Ice Beam}} to {{status|frozen|freeze}} Team Rocket\'s Pokémon. Ash commands Pikachu to use {{m|Thunder}} to blast Team Rocket off. The herd of Lapras are now safe. \n\nBy daybreak, Ash and his friends farewell the Lapras herd. They watch as the leader of the herd asks Ash’s Lapras to take over the lead, and it accepts the honor. Naomi explains to the group that the leader was so impressed by how Ash\'s Lapras had taken charge of the situation the day before that it decided to "hand over" its leadership duty. Lapras turns its head to say goodbye to Ash before it and its herd continue on their migration route. Later, Naomi reports back to Professor Elm that she can finally complete her thesis on Lapras migration patterns. Elm turns his attention to Ash, who is holding an [[Egg case]] with the Egg inside, and asks him to escort the Egg back to his [[New Bark Town]] lab. Ash takes up the task. He and his friends say goodbye to Naomi and her Lanturn before continuing to follow the eastern [[Johto]] shore to New Bark Town.\n\n==Major events==\n[[File:Larvitar Egg.png|thumb|220px|Ash with the Egg]]\n* {{Ash}} is briefly reunited with his {{AP|Lapras}}.\n* Ash is asked to deliver a [[Pokémon Egg]] to [[Professor Elm]].\n* [[Brock\'s Crobat]] is revealed to know {{m|Sonic Boom}}.\n* Ash\'s Lapras becomes the leader of its herd.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n[[File:PMTV EP257.png|thumb|200px|right|{{tt|Pocket Monster TV|Who\'s That Pokémon}}]]\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Professor Elm]]\n* [[Naomi]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP EP257.png|thumb|200px|right|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Qwilfish}} \'\'(US and international)\'\', {{p|Lapras}} \'\'(Japan)\'\'\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Togepi}} ({{OP|Misty|Togepi}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Lapras}} (formerly {{OP|Ash|Lapras}})\n* {{p|Crobat}} ({{OP|Brock|Crobat}})\n* {{p|Arbok}} ({{OP|Jessie|Arbok}})\n* {{p|Weezing}} ({{OP|James|Weezing}})\n* {{p|Lanturn}} ([[Naomi]]\'s)\n* {{p|Lapras}} ({{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Lapras|anime}}; multiple)\n\n==Trivia==\n* {{TRT}} uses the {{p|Gyarados}} [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|submarine]] again, complete with boosters.\n* The episode title refers to the phrase "\'\'lap of luxury\'\'".\n* In this episode, Team Rocket uses a {{DL|Team Rocket mottos|Lapras of Luxury motto|variation}} of their motto.\n* This episode marks the first time that {{Ash}} is reunited with a Pokémon he previously released.\n* This episode is featured on \'\'Volume 15: Lapras\'\' from [[Viz Media]]\'s {{OBP|Pokémon All-Stars|Region 1}} series.\n* Music from \'\'[[PK01|Pikachu\'s Vacation]]\'\' and \'\'[[M02|The Power of One]]\'\' can be heard in this episode.\n* [[Riding on Lapras]] is also used in this episode.\n* This episode was the first to air in Japan after the theatrical release of \'\'[[M05|Pokémon Heroes: Latios & Latias]]\'\'.\n\n===Errors===\n[[File:EP257 error.png|thumb|right|200px|Ash ready to battle with Pikachu]]\n* In the English dub, Ash tells Lapras to use "Cold Beam" instead of {{m|Ice Beam}}.\n* When Ash and {{Ashfr}} catch up to Team Rocket, Ash prepares to battle with {{AP|Pikachu}}, saying, "Pikachu, ready?", yet he\'s also holding a {{i|Poké Ball}} in his hand, implying he was going to use another Pokémon.\n* [[Brock\'s Crobat]] uses {{m|Sonic Boom}} in this episode.
