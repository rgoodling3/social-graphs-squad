Secret of the Lake!\'\') is the 242nd episode of the [[Pokémon anime]]. It was first broadcast in Japan on March 28, 2002 and in the United States on April 12, 2003. \n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/05_33-as-clear-as-crystal/-->\n<i>When a tangle with Team Rocket leaves Pikachu desperately exhausted, a young passerby offers to restore Pikachu\'s energy, but only if the humans present promise never to reveal to another soul what they are about to see. This trainer then proceeds to guide Ash and friends to a legendary lake that somehow seems to restore energy to the Electric Pokémon that live along its banks. Unfortunately, however, Team Rocket manages to tail the young trainers as they enter. Jessie and James are quick to make plans to lay waste to the serene lake, trading its pristine essence for personal gain.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nThe group continue towards [[Blackthorn City]], and {{Ash}} returns to his human self after being turned into [[Ashachu|A Pikachu]] by {{OBP|Lily|EP241}}\'s spell. Now one issue is solved, but {{an|Misty}} is furious to learn that they are once again lost in a forest. Ash manages to settle Misty before {{TRT}} appear [[List of Team Rocket\'s disguises|disguised in an orange and purple tuxedo]]. [[James]] removes the white cloth covering the [[Team Rocket\'s mechas|\'\'PikaPower Mach II\'\']], a machine designed to restore electricity of tired {{t|Electric}} Pokémon like [[Ash\'s Pikachu]]. [[Jessie]] then rips Pikachu off Ash\'s shoulder and straps him in. Next, she radios in {{MTR}} who swoops down in the balloon and takes Pikachu, Jessie, and James into the sky. As they ascend, Jessie and James remove their disguises to reveal themselves. Jessie then tells Ash to command Pikachu to use {{m|Thunderbolt}}. But the energy is absorbed into Team Rocket\'s machine, which also has the power to forcibly drain its victims of energy. Team Rocket threatens to sap all of Pikachu\'s power if Ash doesn\'t hand over the rest of his Pokémon, but Ash simply tells Pikachu to give it all he\'s got. Soon enough, Pikachu\'s power overloads the machine and Team Rocket goes blasting off. Ash happily catches Pikachu, but the power drain has left him exhausted.\n\nJust then, a girl named [[Krystal]] approaches the group. {{an|Brock}} instantly falls in love with her at first sight. However, Ash goes on to tell her that Pikachu is badly hurt and that there isn\'t a [[Pokémon Center]] for miles around. Krystal offers to help, but asks them to keep a very big secret for her in return, and the group agrees to the request. She leads them up a large hill. As they walk, the group notices numerous Electric Pokémon climbing up the hill - Krystal tells them that they\'re all going there for a special reason. When they get to the top of the hill, they find a big lake, which Krystal claims has magical healing powers; the Electric-types come here to rest and recharge. She then orders Ash to put Pikachu into the water, and the Mouse Pokémon is soon good as new. After Pikachu is healed, Krystal takes Ash and his friends out to the middle of the lake in a speedboat to show them the secret to the lake\'s power. When they look down from the bottom of the boat, they see what looks like an underwater temple with a crystal at the bottom. Krystal informs them that the Electric Pokémon have been coming to the lake for years. She explains that according to legend, the temple sank into the water after torrential rains. \n\nUnknowingly, Jessie, James, and Meowth are eavesdropping on the conversation and plot to steal the legendary crystal to become instantly rich. The evil trio put a plan into motion, and use a large mechanical {{p|Tentacruel}}. They retrieve the crystal with little difficulty, but its light suddenly fades out, alerting Ash and his friends that something\'s up. The Team Rocket trio reveals themselves, reciting their {{motto}} before floating away in their balloon. As our heroes fume over this occurrence, the Electric Pokémon start to follow Team Rocket in attempt to get the crystal back. Ash orders Pikachu to {{m|Thunderbolt}} them, and the other Electric Pokémon join in the attack. However, Team Rocket sucks in their energy with the new and improved \'\'PikaPower Mach III\'\'. Gloating that their new machine is better than ever, the villains begin forcibly drawing energy from the Electric Pokémon, but black clouds appear in the sky, followed by a mighty screech and a huge bolt of lightning that breaks the circuit between the Electric Pokémon and the machine. \n\nAs everyone wonders what this means, the sky darkens and the clouds part to reveal the [[legendary birds|Legendary Bird]] {{p|Zapdos}}. In a rage, Zapdos flies towards Team Rocket to zap their PikaPower Mach III. However, even Zapdos loses energy and the group starts to wonder why it doesn\'t seem to have much power in the first place. Team Rocket gloats, but Zapdos unleashes its full power and overloads the \'\'PikaPower Mach III\'\', sending Team Rocket blasting off again. But then Zapdos falls out of the sky to the ground. Still angry and flailing about, it finally faints from weakness - clearly, it is in bad shape.\n\nKrystal tells the group that this is the \'\'real\'\' secret - Zapdos itself often visits the lake to recharge itself. Needing the crystal to heal Zapdos, Ash and his friends set off to find Team Rocket and the crystal. Pikachu senses the crystal is nearby, so they follow it to where Team Rocket had crashed. In an attempt to keep the crystal for themselves, Team Rocket sends out {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}} and {{TP|James|Victreebel}} - although James again has to deal with the latter attempting to eat his head. Jessie orders Arbok to use {{m|Poison Sting}}, but Ash\'s Pikachu dodges and uses {{m|Quick Attack}}. With Arbok thrown into Jessie by the force of the blow, James orders Victreebel to use {{m|Razor Leaf}} - however, Ash tells Pikachu to use Quick Attack again, hitting Victreebel into its {{pkmn|Trainer}}. Ash demands that Team Rocket hand over the crystal, but Jessie instead throws Ash a {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}} balloon, which inflates and bursts. Under cover of the resulting dust storm, Team Rocket makes a getaway in a new Wobbuffet balloon - in response, Ash sends out {{AP|Bayleef}} and orders her to use her {{m|Vine Whip}}. Seeing the crystal being pulled from the balloon, James orders Victreebel to use its Vine Whip to get the crystal back. As the {{type|Grass}} types struggle to break each other\'s grip on the crystal, Jessie orders Arbok to use {{m|Poison Sting}}. However, Pikachu uses Thunderbolt to blast Team Rocket off again, the crystal falling from their grasp. Running to catch the crystal, Ash dives off a cliff. Luckily, Bayleef catches Ash in time with her vines.\n\nWith the crystal secure, Ash and his friends return to the lake, where Ash dives underwater and places it back in its rightful place. He resurfaces, but the crystal remains dark. Pikachu and the other Electric Pokémon are determined, so they swim over to the crystal and use their attacks to charge it up. The crystal\'s mystical blue glow returns once again. The group puts the injured Zapdos into the lake, where it sinks to the bottom - however, the crystal stops glowing before it can heal the Legendary Bird. The Electric Pokémon use charge up the crystal again, which helps power up Zapdos as well. Fully recharged, Zapdos rises out of the water, releasing a mighty Thunderbolt that completely restores the crystal\'s glow. With the lake back to normal, Zapdos flies off into the distance as everyone waves goodbye.\n\nAsh and {{ashfr}} are then shown ready to leave, promising Krystal that they won\'t tell anyone about the lake or Zapdos. Brock makes a last attempt to woo her, but Misty pulls him away by the ear before the group continues on their way. Elsewhere, Team Rocket are clinging onto each other as they hang from a cliff. Zapdos soars passed them and delivers an electric shock.\n\n==Major events==\n* {{Ash}} reverts to human form after [[Ashachu|his transformation]].\n* Ash and {{ashfr}} see a {{p|Zapdos}}.\n{{animeevents}}\n\n===Debuts===\n====Pokémon debuts====\n=====TV episode debuts=====\n* {{p|Zapdos}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Humans===\n[[File:PMTV EP242.png|thumb|200px|right|{{tt|Pocket Monster TV|Who\'s That Pokémon}}]]\n* {{Ash}}\n* {{an|Misty}}\n* {{an|Brock}}\n* [[Jessie]]\n* [[James]]\n* [[Krystal]]\n\n===Pokémon===\n[[File:WTP EP242.png|thumb|200px|right|Who\'s That Pokémon?]]\n[[Who\'s That Pokémon?]]: {{p|Kingdra}} \'\'(US and international)\'\', {{p|Zapdos}} \'\'(Japan)\'\' \n\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ({{OP|Ash|Pikachu}})\n* {{p|Pikachu}} ([[Ashachu]]; reverts)\n* {{p|Meowth}} ({{TRM}})\n* {{p|Togepi}} ({{OP|Misty|Togepi}})\n* {{p|Wobbuffet}} ({{OP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}})\n* {{p|Bayleef}} ({{OP|Ash|Bayleef}})\n* {{p|Arbok}} ({{OP|Jessie|Arbok}})\n* {{p|Victreebel}} ({{OP|James|Victreebel}})\n* {{p|Zapdos}}\n* {{p|Raichu}}\n* {{p|Magnemite}}\n* {{p|Voltorb}}\n* {{p|Electabuzz}}\n* {{p|Jolteon}}\n* {{p|Chinchou}}\n* {{p|Ampharos}}\n\n==Trivia== \n* The concept of this episode, as well as the appearance of the {{type|Electric}} member of a [[legendary trio]], is somewhat similar to \'\'[[The Legend of Thunder!]]\'\', which focused on {{p|Raikou}}. It is also believed that [[Professor Sebastian]]\'s Miracle Crystal System was made from the crystal seen in this episode. It is also implied that the crystal must have been stolen from the lake by Sebastian and his minions.\n* [[Jessie]] [[Breaking the fourth wall|breaks the fourth wall]] in this episode by asking [[James]] to explain their mecha to their "viewing audience".\n* Music from \'\'[[PK01|Pikachu\'s Vacation]]\'\', \'\'[[M01|Mewtwo Strikes Back]]\'\', and \'\'[[M02|The Power of One]]\'\' can be heard in this episode.\n* When James says "Time to say adieu!", {{MTR}} sings "To you, and you, and you and you and you!" to the tune of the song \'\'So Long, Farewell\'\' from the musical film \'\'{{wp|The Sound of Music}}\'\'.\n* {{TRT}} is sent blasting off three times in this episode.\n* This episode is featured on the \'\'Volume 4: Electric\'\' copy of [[Pokémon Elements]].\n\n===Errors===\n<!--Please do not mention anything about the main characters acting like they haven\'t seen anything before. No one is expected to remember everything.-->\n* When [[Ashachu]] turns back into {{Ash}}, Ash\'s bag magically reappears after its disappearance in the [[EP241|previous episode]].\n* Voltorb is one of the Pokémon seen in the water, but throughout the episode, it says "Electrode".\n* When Pikachu collapses from exhaustion, Brock attributes it to all the {{m|Thunder Shock}}s he used against Team Rocket. However, Pikachu had used {{m|Thunderbolt}}.\n* During one scene, all the {{type|Electric}} Pokémon in the lake shock the crystal. Ash was unaffected by this, even though he was in the lake at the time.\n* Brock says that he thought Team Rocket\'s balloon had fallen near where he was when looking for them, but Team Rocket got knocked out of the balloon upon it exploding and therefore should not have crashed with it. In spite of this, they are found with it, anyways.\n* As shown various times in the anime that when electricity is used in water, all the people who are in contact of water also get electrocuted, but when all the Electric Pokémon are trying to revive Zapdos, Ash is not even affected even though he was in water.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* In the dub, when Misty complains about being lost in the woods and not getting her "beauty sleep", Ash reassures her that they\'ll make it out of the woods and adds, "[B]esides, Misty, you don\'t need beauty sleep." In the original version, he only talks about how they are sure to find their way.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=DDDDDD|bordercolor=FFCB49\n|bg={{tt|Ясно като кристал|As Clear as Crystal}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|閃電鳥跟水晶，湖的秘密|Zapdos and the Crystal, Secret of the Lake}}\n|de={{tt|Kristallklare Sache|Crystal clear case}}\n|nl={{tt|Zo Helder als Kristal|As Clear as Crystal}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Le lac magique|The magic lake}}\n|he=בהיר כבדולח {{tt|bahir kabdolakh|Clear as Crystal}}\n|it={{tt|Il cristallo magico|The magic crystal}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Tão Claro quanto um Cristal|As Clear as a Crystal}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Claro como Cristal|As Clear as Crystal}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Tan claro como el cristal!|As clear as crystal!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|El cristal poderoso|The powerful crystal}}\n|pl={{tt|Czysty jak kryształ|Clear as crystal}}\n|hi=जादुई क्रिस्टल {{tt|\'\'Jadooi Crystal\'\'|Magical Crystal}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}}\n}}\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP241 |\nprevtitle=Hocus Pokémon |\nnextcode=EP243 |\nnexttitle=Same Old Song and Dance |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Johto | }}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0242}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|242]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Shōji Yonemura]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Yoshitaka Fujimoto]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Toshiaki Suzuki]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Hiroshi Sakai]]\n[[Category:Episodes in which a Legendary Pokémon appears]]\n\n[[de:Kristallklare Sache]]\n[[es:EP244]]\n[[fr:EP242]]\n[[ja:無印編第242話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第243集]]'}
