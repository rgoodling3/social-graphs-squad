It first aired in Japan on September 2, 1999 and in the United States on September 23, 2000.\n\n{{spoilers}}\n\n==Blurb==\n<!--http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/03_06-hello-pummelo/-->\n<i>After winning his way to the final competition for the Orange League Winner\'s Trophy, victory seems a long shot for Ash as the Gym Leader deploys a powerful Gengar that topples one of Ash\'s Pokémon after another.</i>\n\n==Plot==\nAs {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} approach [[Pummelo Island]], they notice a mysterious {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} {{m|fly}}ing around, which seems to be a {{TP|Drake|Dragonite}}. Upon reaching the island, Ash registers himself for a {{pkmn|battle}} against {{OBP|Drake|Orange League}}, the [[Orange Crew Supreme Gym Leader|Supreme Gym Leader]] of the [[Orange League|Orange Crew]]. After having his [[Badge]]s verified, he is informed that his battle will be held the following morning and that it will be a [[Full Battle]]. Ash gets ready to start {{pkmn|training}}, but {{an|Misty}} tells him that he needs to know where the stadium is first. The assistant escorts Ash and his friends to [[Pummelo Stadium]] and the nearby [[Palace of Victory]], where all victorious {{pkmn|Trainer}}s are immortalized. The attendant explains that no one has beaten Drake in a long time, and the reason why no one has been able to beat him is because his {{TP|Drake|Dragonite}} was too strong. Meanwhile, on the Pummelo Stadium battlefield, {{TRT}} appears to steal Drake\'s Dragonite. However, it uses a single {{m|Hyper Beam}}, which sends them blasting off.\n\nAsh gets ready to train, but finds that his {{AP|Snorlax}} won\'t wake up. Upon consulting [[Nurse Joy]], she states that Snorlax, who had just eaten, probably won\'t wake up for several days and will have to miss the Full Battle. Ash calls {{an|Professor Oak}}, who suggests using one of {{cat|Ash\'s Pokémon|his other Pokémon}} instead. {{AP|Kingler}}, {{AP|Muk}}, and one of his {{AP|Tauros}} turn up, and Ash decides to use Tauros due to the "beginner\'s luck" factor that won him his battle with Kingler and Muk back in the [[Indigo Plateau Conference]]. Ash puts Snorlax\'s {{i|Poké Ball}} on the transporter and receives Tauros in return. Meanwhile, [[Jessie]] and [[James]] contemplate their humiliating defeat. A van drives passed and informs everyone that a challenger has been found to battle the Supreme Gym Leader the next day. {{MTR}} suggests that they can get Dragonite when the challenger has weakened it.\n\nThe next morning, Ash arrives at Pummelo Stadium, ready to battle. After the customary handshake, the [[Battle judge|referee]] explains that the state of the field will change after one of them has three unconscious Pokémon. At that moment, the flat field disappears and is replaced by a rocky field with a pool in the middle. Outside, Team Rocket watches from one of the television screens, and they are amazed to learn that Ash is the challenger.\n\nDrake starts with {{p|Ditto}}, while Ash starts with {{AP|Pikachu}}. Ditto starts with {{m|Transform}} to turn into a Pikachu. Pikachu begins with a powerful {{m|Thunder}}, and Ditto uses its own Thunder. Next, they both exchange a {{m|Thunder Shock}} at the same time. The rocks begin to crumble underfoot, hurting Pikachu but not Ditto, who calmly hops from one to the other. Ash is frustrated, and ignores Misty\'s suggestion that he substitute Pikachu for another Pokémon. Ditto starts using {{m|Agility}}, while Pikachu tries to shock it with {{m|Thunderbolt}}, but it proves to be too quick and evades the attack. Ditto then hits Pikachu with Thunder, but it has no effect as Pikachu channels it to the ground with his tail. Pikachu then uses {{m|Quick Attack}} and Ditto copies the move. The two opponents confront each other midair with an {{t|Electric}} attack before falling to the ground. However, Pikachu manages to get up and knocks Ditto out with his tail to win the round. {{Tracey}} realizes that Pikachu managed to win because he was in better physical shape.\n\nDrake congratulates Ash on his first victory before sending out his next Pokémon, an {{p|Onix}}. Ash recalls Pikachu and sends out {{AP|Squirtle}}. As Ash tells Squirtle to use {{m|Water Gun}}, Drake has Onix to {{m|Dig|burrow underground}} and avoid the attack. Initially unsure on what to do, Ash eventually decides to send Squirtle into the water. However, Onix gets to Squirtle first, knocking it into the air before holding it in a {{m|Bind}}. Squirtle manages to counter this by using {{m|Withdraw}} followed by {{m|Hydro Pump}}. Onix is unable to escape the torrent, and Squirtle finishes off its opponent with {{m|Skull Bash}}.\n\nDrake informs Ash that he won\'t have a ghost of a chance against his third Pokémon, {{p|Gengar}}. Misty and Tracey are worried as no Pokémon is strong against a {{type|Ghost}}, so Ash decides to try his beginner\'s luck strategy and sends out Tauros. Tauros uses {{m|Fissure}}, but Gengar jumps into the air, making the attack useless. Gengar then uses {{m|Confuse Ray}} on Tauros, who starts running into the rocks, leaving Ash with no choice but to recall Tauros. He then sends out Lapras and decides to counter Confuse Ray with {{m|Ice Beam}}. Lapras avoids Gengar\'s initial attacks by diving underwater, emerging to hit Gengar with a {{m|Water Gun}}. Gengar then tries {{m|Night Shade}}, so Lapras uses Ice Beam. The two attacks collide in an explosion that engulfs the entire arena, leaving Ash and Drake in shock.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.

It initially appears as a {{p|Pikachu}}, but then {{m|transform}}s back into Ditto when it is revealed.\n* During the {{pkmn|battle}} between {{AP|Pikachu}} and Ditto, Pikachu\'s {{m|Quick Attack}} and Ditto\'s {{m|Agility}} look the same.\n* {{OBP|Drake|Orange League}}\'s {{p|Gengar}} is able to hover over {{AP|Tauros}}\'s {{m|Fissure}} attack, rendering it useless. While at the time this was impossible in the games, the concept of certain Pokémon, including Gengar, floating to evade {{type|Ground}} moves {{a|Levitate|would later be implemented}}.\n* The book [[Thundershock in Pummelo Stadium]] is based on this episode.\n\n===Errors===\n* In the scene where {{Ash}} scans his [[Pokédex]] for {{p|Dragonite}}, the statue is above it, not underneath it.\n* Even though Ash caught his Tauros in a [[Safari Ball]], from this episode onward, he will always be seen to have it in a {{i|Poké Ball|normal Poké Ball}}.\n* {{Tracey}} says that there is no type which would be really strong against a {{type|Ghost}} Pokémon. In reality, Ghost-type Pokémon are weak against themselves.\n* The announcer refers to Gengar\'s {{m|Confuse Ray}} as "Confusion Ray".\n* When Ash [[recall]]s his Tauros, a part of his glove is missing.\n\n===Dub edits===\n* [[Pikachu\'s Jukebox]]: [[What Kind of Pokémon Are You?]]\n* Although the dub implies that Drake is merely a fifth Gym Leader in the Orange League, the Japanese version specifically uses the title Head Leader to denote his importance.\n* When Ash is thinking about what Pokémon to use against {{p|Gengar}}, Tracey originally tells Ash to use Psychic or {{type|Ground}} moves against the {{2t|Ghost|Poison}} Pokémon, making Ash choose Tauros due to him knowing Fissure. In the dub, Tracey says that there is no type that is really strong against a Ghost-type Pokémon, which Ash answers by saying, "Now\'s a good time as any for a little beginner\'s luck."\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Epilang|color=FFDDAA|bordercolor=FFBB55\n|bg={{tt|Привет, Пумело!|Hello, Pummelo!}}\n|zh_cmn={{tt|勝利者盃，全員大對決，六VS六|Victory Cup, Full Battle, 6 VS 6}}\n|cs={{tt|Konečně turnaj!|Finally, the tournament!}}\n|nl={{tt|Hallo, Pummelo!|Hello, Pummelo!}}\n|de={{tt|Hallo Pummelo|Hello Pummelo}}\n|fr_eu={{tt|Bienvenue à Pomelo|Welcome to Pummelo}}\n|he=שלום פאמלו {{tt|\'\'Shalom Pummelo\'\'|Hello Pummelo}}\n|hu=Hello, Pummelo!\n|it={{tt|L\'isola del drago|The island of the dragon}}{{tt|*|Original 2000 dub}} <br> {{tt|Benvenuti a Pummelo|Welcome to Pummelo}}{{tt|*|2014 K2 TV dub}}\n|pt_br={{tt|Alô, Pummelo!|Hello, Pummelo!}}\n|pt_eu={{tt|Olá Pummelo|Hello Pummelo}}\n|es_la={{tt|¡Hola Pumello!|Hello Pumello!}}\n|es_eu={{tt|Hola Pomelo|Hello Pumello}}\n|pl={{tt|Witaj, Pumello|Hello, Pumello}}\n|hi=हेलो, Pummelo {{tt|\'\'Hello, Pummelo\'\'|Hello, Pummelo (Same as English)}} {{tt|*|Hungama dub}} \n}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{EpicodePrevNext|\nprevcode=EP110 |\nprevtitle=The Stun Spore Detour |\nnextcode=EP112 |\nnexttitle=Enter The Dragonite |\nseries=Original series |\ncolorscheme=Orange}}\n{{Project Anime notice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:0111}}\n[[Category:Original series episodes|111]]\n[[Category:Episodes written by Atsuhiro Tomioka]]\n[[Category:Episodes storyboarded by Yoshitaka Fujimoto]]\n[[Category:Episodes directed by Osamu Inoue]]\n[[Category:Episodes animated by Shin\'ichirō Kajiura]]\n[[Category:Pokémon League episodes]]\n[[Category:Episodes focusing on Ash]]\n\n[[de:Hallo Pummelo]]\n[[es:EP113]]\n[[fr:EP111]]\n[[it:EP111]]\n[[ja:無印編第111話]]\n[[zh:精灵宝可梦 第112集]]'}
