It first aired in Japan on July 28, 2019 and is scheduled to air in the United States on November 30, 2019.\n{{spoilers}}\n<!--\n==Blurb==\nOfficial Blurb from Pokémon.com goes here, with source link-->\n<!--Please do not alter the blurb to fix any errors, they are meant to be presented as they are on the official site.-->\n\n==Plot==\n{{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Wingull}} arrives at [[Melemele Island]] and informs [[Toucannon\'s flock]] that {{AP|Rowlet}} is competing in a tough match against a {{p|Decidueye}}, prompting Toucannon, {{p|Trumbeak}}, and several {{p|Pikipek}} to leave for [[Manalo Stadium]]. Meanwhile, {{Ash}} is already {{pkmn|training}} with {{AP|Pikachu}} and Rowlet, who is hoping to overcome [[Hau]]\'s Decidueye. Though [[Ash\'s friends]] advise {{AP|Torracat}}\'s {{t|Fire}} attacks would be more effective against Decidueye, Ash is insistent on choosing Rowlet and declares that he has no secret plan in mind. {{an|Kiawe}} quickly supports the tactic after seeing Rowlet\'s enthusiasm, though the others have their doubts. Ash decides to keep training with Rowlet while everyone else goes to watch {{an|Gladion}}\'s match.\n[[File:SM132 James VS Gladion.png|thumb|left|250px|James facing Gladion]]\nWhile fuming over her loss against [[James]] in the previous round, [[Jessie]] demands he win or else before handing him the [[Z-Ring]] to ensure victory. Soon, James and Gladion enter the battlefield as [[Caster]] introduces the latter to the audience. James calls out {{TP|James|Mareanie}} for a pep talk; Mareanie agrees to do its best and fulfill James\'s personal goal of battling the {{an|Professor Kukui|Masked Royal}}. After [[Hapu]] calls for the second round match to begin, James makes the first move, but [[Gladion\'s Lycanroc]] easily evades the oncoming {{m|Sludge Bomb}}.\n\nMeanwhile, Rowlet falls asleep again during Ash\'s training session. {{Rotom}} suggests Rowlet should learn a new [[move]] for a counter-strategy. Rowlet soon wakes up as its foster family arrives to lend a hand. After Rowlet informs Toucannon of its concerns for its upcoming match, Toucannon shows its {{m|Feather Dance}} technique. Rotom adds that the move would be ideal against Hau\'s Decidueye, as Feather Dance weakens an opponent\'s attack. With that, Ash and Rowlet begin to try to master Feather Dance.\n\nElsewhere, Mareanie manages to stand up, though she is clearly exhausted. As Lycanroc increases its attack power with {{m|Swords Dance}}, James decides to use a [[Z-Move]] and performs {{m|Black Hole Eclipse}} with Mareanie. Gladion counters with his own Z-Move, {{m|Continental Crush}}, with Lycanroc hurling a giant boulder directly at Mareanie\'s black hole. In the crowd, [[Nanu]] recalls how [[SM077|Ash used the same strategy]] during their [[Island challenge|grand trial]] match. The two Z-Moves cancel each other out, and Gladion has Lycanroc follow up with {{m|Stone Edge}}, winning the round. A dejected James walks backstage and is confronted by Jessie, though instead of receiving a scolding, she rewards his efforts with a can of {{DL|Pokémon Center Café|Drinks|Komala Coffee}}. {{MTR}} adds that they will just think of another way to conquer [[Alola]], and Jessie declares that [[Team Rocket]] only looks to the future. James is greatly relieved, as is Mareanie, who goes on to poison him in admiration.\n[[File:SM132 Ash VS Hau.png|thumb|250px|Ash facing Hau]]\nLater, Rotom interrupts Ash\'s training session to inform him that Gladion won his match and that his own match is about to begin. The Trumbeak and Pikipek return in time to deliver Rowlet a special gift, a Decidueye-styled cloak meant to encourage it to win. The flock leaves, while Ash returns to the stadium. Backstage, Hau declares his hopes to defeat Ash and prove himself as a strong Trainer. Ash shares his sentiments, also admitting that he wants to win the entire [[Manalo Conference]]. The two are called over to the battlefield; Hau runs off first, while Ash takes a moment to call out his Pokémon from their {{i|Poké Ball}}s so they could cheer him and Rowlet on. Ash\'s friends are relieved to see Ash made it to his match, though they are concerned about how his training went. Meanwhile, Toucannon\'s flock perches themselves on the stadium rooftop to watch the battle.\n\nNanu begins the match, and Hau orders Decidueye to use {{m|Razor Leaf}}. Rowlet dodges it before launching {{m|Seed Bomb}}, though Decidueye batters the [[Everstone]] away with {{m|Leaf Blade}}. Ash decides to use his Z-Move early, but Decidueye simply flies upwards and evades {{m|Bloom Doom}}. Hau reveals he did his research and calls Ash\'s tactic predictable. Decidueye then shoots a {{m|Spirit Shackle}} arrow, pinning Rowlet to the battlefield and allowing Hau to uses his own Z-Move, {{m|Sinister Arrow Raid}}. The attack hits its target, but Rowlet is revealed to have used its cloak as a makeshift {{m|substitute}}. Seeing as the match is yet to be won, Hau confidently declares that his next move won\'t miss.\n\n==Major events==\n<!-- This is not for summarizing everything that happens in this episode.
