There are yellow ring-shaped markings down the sides of its segmented body, which resemble its eyes and are meant to scare off predators. Its most notable characteristic is the bright red antenna ({{wp|osmeterium}}) on its head, which releases a stench to repel predators. Despite these features and its camouflage in green foliage, Caterpie is often preyed upon by {{type|Flying}} Pokémon. Its four tiny feet are tipped with suction cups, permitting this Pokémon to scale most surfaces with minimal effort.\n\nCaterpie is easy to capture and grows quickly, making it ideal for new {{pkmn|Trainer}}s. It will shed its skin many times before finally cocooning itself in thick silk. It can also spit this silk in order to entangle foes as seen in [[EP003|the anime]]. It has a voracious appetite, which drives it to eat a hundred leaves a day. It will even eat leaves bigger than itself. According to [[PS054|Pokémon Adventures]], its favorite food is the Vermilion flower. Caterpie lives in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|temperate forests and jungles}}.\n\n==In the anime==\n===In the main series===\n[[File:Ash Caterpie M20.png|thumb|250px|Caterpie in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]\n====Major appearances====\n=====[[Ash\'s Caterpie]]=====\nCaterpie debuted in \'\'[[EP002|Pokémon Emergency!]]\'\', where {{Ash}} encountered it in [[Viridian Forest]].

They are both known as the Worm Pokémon.\n* Until the release of {{game|Platinum}}, when it became able to learn {{m|Bug Bite}}, Caterpie was unable to do anything to a {{t|Ghost}} type except {{m|Struggle|struggling}} and {{m|String Shot|lowering its Speed}}. It shares this trait with its evolution, {{p|Metapod}}. This is also true for {{p|Weedle}}, and its evolution, {{p|Kakuna}}, against {{t|Steel}} types before {{game|Platinum}} was released.\n** Due to this, it was impossible to complete a [[Generation I]] game using only Caterpie or Metapod, since Struggle couldn\'t hit Ghost types at the time.\n* In the anime and in Pokémon Adventures, Caterpie holds the record as the Pokémon who takes the least time to evolve twice, taking only [[BW130|one episode]] in the anime and [[PS89|one chapter]] in Pokémon Adventures.\n** [[Polibo|Poliwag]] and [[Togebo|Togepi]] also share this record, but in Pokémon Adventures only.\n* Prior to Generation VI, Caterpie\'s body style was [[File:Body02.png]].\n* In \'\'[[EP003|Ash Catches a Pokémon]]\'\', when Caterpie evolves into Metapod, the process was similar to a real caterpillar going into pupation. [[AG142|Later]] [[BW130|episodes]] show Caterpie evolving like the rest of the Pokémon do.\n* Caterpie is tied with {{p|Magikarp}}, {{p|Carvanha}}, {{p|Igglybuff}}, {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Attack Forme}} {{p|Deoxys}}, and {{p|Weedle}} for having the lowest Special Defense stat of all Pokémon.\n\n===Origin===\nCaterpie is a stylized {{wp|caterpillar}}, most resembling an {{wp|Papilio xuthus|Asian swallowtail}}. Its "antenna" is an {{wp|osmeterium}}, an organ unique to swallowtail caterpillars which, like Caterpie, they use to emit a foul odor. The tip of Caterpie\'s tail resembles the horn at the rear end of most species of {{wp|Sphingidae|hawk moth}} larvae.\n\n====Name origin====\nCaterpie is a corruption of \'\'{{wp|caterpillar}}\'\'.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Other languages|type=Bug|type2=Bug\n|ja=キャタピー \'\'Caterpie\'\'|jameaning=From {{tt|キャタピラー \'\'kyatapirā\'\'|caterpillar}}\n|fr=Chenipan|frmeaning=From \'\'{{tt|chenille|caterpillar}}\'\' and \'\'{{tt|pan|trail}}\'\'; also a pun on \'\'{{tt|chenapan|rascal}}\'\'\n|es=Caterpie|esmeaning=Same as English/Japanese name\n|de=Raupy|demeaning=From \'\'{{tt|Raupe|caterpillar}}\'\'\n|it=Caterpie|itmeaning=Same as English/Japanese name\n|ko=캐터피 \'\'Caterpie\'\'|komeaning=Same as Japanese name\n|bg=Катерпи \'\'Katerpi\'\'|bgmeaning=Transcription as English/Japanese name\n|zh_yue=綠毛蟲 \'\'Luhkmòuhchùhng\'\'|zh_yuemeaning="Green caterpillar", or literally, "Green furry worm"\n|zh_cmn=綠毛蟲 / 绿毛虫 \'\'Lǜmáochóng\'\'|zh_cmnmeaning="Green caterpillar", or literally, "Green furry worm"\n|he=קטרפי \'\'Caterpy\'\'|hemeaning=Transcription of English name\n|hi=कटेरपी \'\'Caterpie\'\'|himeaning=Transcription of English/Japanese name\n|lt=Katerpis|ltmeaning=From English name\n|ru=Катерпи \'\'Katerpi\'\'|rumeaning=Transcription of English/Japanese name\n}}\n<br clear="left">\n\n==Related articles==\n* [[Ash\'s Caterpie]]\n* [[Kitty]]\n* [[Caterpie (Red and Blue Rescue Team)]]\n<!--\n==Notes==-->\n\n==External links==\n* {{wp|Caterpie, Metapod, and Butterfree|Article on Wikipedia}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{PokémonPrevNext/Head|type=Bug}}\n{{PokémonPrevNext/Pokémon|type=Bug|prevnum=009|prev=Blastoise|nextnum=011|next=Metapod|round=yes}}\n|}\n{{Project Pokédex notice}}\n\n[[Category:Body style 02 Pokémon]]<!--Prior to Gen VI-->\n\n[[de:Raupy]]\n[[es:Caterpie]]\n[[fr:Chenipan]]\n[[it:Caterpie]]\n[[ja:キャタピー]]\n[[zh:绿毛虫]]'}
