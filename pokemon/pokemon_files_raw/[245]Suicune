Of the three Legendary beasts, Suicune is said to represent the rains that quenched the flames of the burning Brass Tower.\n\nSuicune is the [[game mascot]] of {{game|Crystal}}, appearing on the boxart.\n\nSuicune is pursued in the {{pkmn|anime}}, [[Pokémon Adventures|manga]], {{game|Crystal}}, and {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}} by [[Eusine]].\n\n==Biology==\nSuicune is a slim, quadruped, blue, mammalian Pokémon with white, diamond-shaped markings. Its face and underside are white as well. Suicune has a thick, purple mane that resembles the {{wp|aurora borealis}} and two white, streamer-like tails that wave forward. It has a long, white snout. Suicune has a large, hexagonal, cerulean blue crest on its forehead that resembles the antlers of a {{wp|Qilin}} with two prongs on either side of the base. It has red eyes, a small tuft of fur under its chin, and small paws with white paw pads.\n\nSuicune has the power to walk across water and purify dirty water with one touch. It travels across {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grasslands}} in search of water to purify. Northern winds always seem to blow stronger in its presence. In {{game|Crystal}}, Suicune is said to be the closest of the [[Legendary beasts]] to {{p|Ho-Oh}}. It is also said to have a link to the {{p|Unown}}. [[DP028|In the anime]], Suicune is shown to be heroic, serious, and calm during dangerous situations.\n\n==In the anime==\n===In the main series===\n====Major appearances====\n[[File:Suicune M20.png|250px|thumb|Suicune in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]\n[[File:Sugimori Suicune AG.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Ken Sugimori|Sugimori]] reference sheet for the anime]]\n====={{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Suicune|Suicune (anime)}}=====\nSuicune debuted in \'\'[[EP117|Don\'t Touch That \'dile]]\'\' when {{Ash}}, {{an|Misty}}, and {{an|Brock}} spotted one in the middle of a lake near [[New Bark Town]].

It wasn\'t officially seen until \'\'[[PS122|Querulous Qwilfish]]\'\' where it had cured the baby Qwilfish {{adv|Crystal}} had rescued and cleansed the sea water. It appeared in \'\'[[PS138|Really Raikou & Entirely Entei I]]\'\', joining Raikou and Entei against Falkner and afterwards discussed with them about Ho-oh. It was revealed in a flashback in \'\'[[PS141|Hello, Lickitung]]\'\', where it was awakened by {{adv|Yellow}} along with its two counterparts, and the three raced around [[Kanto]] and [[Johto]] looking for {{pkmn|Trainer}}s to help them defeat the [[Masked Man]] to free {{p|Ho-Oh}}. Suicune, in particular, personally challenges many of the [[Gym Leader]]s in the two [[region]]s. During its travels, it encounters both [[Eusine]] and {{adv|Crystal}}, both of which become obsessed with capturing it. Eusine acquires the [[Clear Bell|Crystal Bell]] from the Rocket trio he defeats, but he and Crystal are still unable to capture Suicune. Crystal has her confidence shattered by this (and by the guilt of interrupting Suicune\'s attempt to contact its old master) and has to retreat back to her old training grounds to regain her confidence, which she does by reacquiring her catching skills capturing a wild {{p|Larvitar}}. Suicune later chooses [[Misty]] as its partner and fights alongside her, but then pairs up with Crystal anyways after Misty becomes injured, much to the dismay of Eusine.\n\nA Ditto {{m|transform}}ed into a Suicune to distract Crystal and Eusine in \'\'[[PS127|Miltank Melee]]\'\', while [[Team Rocket Elite Trio|Ken, Al and Harry]] surrounded the real one. Ditto\'s stretchiness was able to grab both of them, but Crystal managed to escaped with her [[Monlee]] and defeated the Ditto.\n\nAn ice sculpture of a Suicune appeared in [[Mahogany Gym]] in \'\'[[PS143|Irked Igglybuff and Curmudgeonly Cleffa]]\'\', where it started to move and battled [[Whitney]] and [[Pryce]]. It was later destroyed in \'\'[[PS144|Savvy Swinub]]\'\', were it was revealed to Whitney and the Radio Crew that Pryce uses it for battle practice.\n\n===In the Pokémon Gold & Silver: The Golden Boys manga===\nA Suicune appeared in \'\'[[GB11|Gold and Black VS Team Rocket]]\'\' and \'\'[[GB12|The Legendary Pokémon]]\'\'.\n\n===In the Pokémon Pocket Monsters manga===\nA Suicune appeared in [[PMHGSS04]] and [[PMHGSS05]].\n\n==In the TCG==\n{{main|Suicune (TCG)}}\n\n==Other appearances==\n[[File:Pokkén Suicune.png|220px|thumb|Suicune in Pokkén Tournament]]\n===[[Pokkén Tournament]]===\nSuicune is a Standard-type playable character in Pokkén.

If it is not caught, Suicune can be found in the Burned Tower after defeating the [[Elite Four]] again.\n* {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}: Suicune first appears alongside {{p|Raikou}} up on [[Revelation Mountain]] where they confronted {{mdc|Krookodile|smd}} believing he turned {{p|Entei}} to stone but discovered {{p|Nuzleaf}} was responsible and was turned to stone.

Normally knowing {{m|Surf}} if [[Snagging|snagged]] in [[The Under]] or [[Realgam Tower]], Suicune instead knows {{m|Hydro Pump}} if it is snagged in [[Deep Colosseum]].\n\n===Origin===\nSuicune is thought to be based on numerous creatures and mythological deities, mainly the {{wp|Qilin}} or "Kirin", an Eastern legend that has traits of {{wp|Chinese dragon}}s, {{wp|unicorn}}s, {{wp|deer}}, {{wp|big cat}}s, and other beasts. The Qilin was said to be able to walk on water and is known to be a powerful and peaceful creature. The crest on Suicune\'s head roughly matches the description of the beast\'s antlers. The spots of Suicune are also significant, seeming to combine the spots of a {{wp|leopard}}, taking homage from {{wp|Fūjin}}, the Shinto god of The North Wind, who wears leopard skin. Leopards themselves are found in Asia and are featured in myths that show it is a widely respected sacred animal like the Qilin. The way it runs and roars in the anime may also relate to the leopard. Being a Pokémon that represents the wind and rain, Suicune may also be based on some of the world\'s numerous myths of wind deities. Suicune\'s mane is meant to resemble a northern {{wp|aurora}}.\n\n====Name origin====\nSuicune may be a combination of 水 \'\'sui\'\' (water) and 君 \'\'kun\'\' (monarch). The [[Pokémon Crystal Version|game title]] it is the mascot of suggests that it may derive from 水晶 \'\'suishō\'\' (crystal).\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Other languages|type=Water|type2=Water\n|ja=スイクン \'\'Suicune\'\'|jameaning=From {{tt|水 \'\'sui\'\'|water}}, {{tt|水晶 \'\'suishō\'\'|crystal}}, and {{tt|君 \'\'kun\'\'|monarch}}\n|fr=Suicune|frmeaning=Same as Japanese name\n|es=Suicune|esmeaning=Same as Japanese name\n|de=Suicune|demeaning=Same as Japanese name\n|it=Suicune|itmeaning=Same as Japanese name\n|ko=스이쿤 \'\'Suicune\'\'|komeaning=Transliteration of its Japanese name\n|zh_cmn=水君 \'\'Shuǐjūn\'\'|zh_cmnmeaning=From {{tt|水君 \'\'Suikun\'\'|water monarch}}.\n|hi=सुइकून \'\'Suicune\'\'|himeaning=Transcription of English name\n|ru=Суикун \'\'Suikun\'\'|rumeaning=Transcription of English name\n}}\n<br clear="left">\n\n==Related articles==\n* [[Legendary beasts]]\n* [[Suicune (M04)]]\n* [[Legendary beasts (M13)]]\n* {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Suicune|Suicune (anime)}}\n* [[Legendary beasts (Adventures)#Suicune|Suicune (Adventures)]]\n* [[Legendary beasts (Super Mystery Dungeon)]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*{{wp|Suicune|Article on Wikipedia}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{Legendary Pokémon}}\n{{Smash Bros.}}\n{{PokémonPrevNext/Head|type=Water}}\n{{PokémonPrevNext/Pokémon|type=Water|prevnum=244|prev=Entei|nextnum=246|next=Larvitar}}\n|}\n{{Project Pokédex notice}}\n\n[[Category:Shadow Pokémon in Pokémon Colosseum]]\n[[Category:Legendary Pokémon]]\n[[Category:Game mascots]]\n[[Category:Legendary trio Pokémon]]\n[[Category:Legendary Pokémon obtainable before the Elite Four]]\n[[Category:Kanto Legendary Pokémon]]\n[[Category:Johto Legendary Pokémon]]\n[[Category:Orre Legendary Pokémon]]\n[[Category:Roaming Pokémon]]\n\n[[de:Suicune]]\n[[es:Suicune]]\n[[fr:Suicune]]\n[[it:Suicune]]\n[[ja:スイクン]]\n[[zh:水君]]'}
