In ancient times it came in conflict with {{p|Kyogre}}, a Pokémon with the ability to expand the oceans. In {{game3|Ruby and Sapphire|Pokémon Ruby|s}}, {{v2|Emerald}}, and [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|Omega Ruby]], Groudon is sought after by [[Team Magma]] as a major part of their plot to create more habitats for land Pokémon by lowering the sea level.\n\nGroudon is the [[game mascot]] of Pokémon Ruby and its remake Pokémon Omega Ruby, with Groudon appearing on the box art of Ruby and Primal Groudon appearing on the box art of Omega Ruby.\n\nAlong with {{p|Kyogre}} and {{p|Rayquaza}}, Groudon is a part of the [[weather trio]].\n\n==Biology==\nGroudon is a massive, bipedal, dinosaur-like creature covered in red, segmented plates of thick skin that act as armor. It has a gray underside and large white spikes that run along the sides of its head, body, and tail. It has four claws on each hand, four dozer-like blades on the end of its large tail, and three claws on each foot with gray markings under its feet. It also has blue stripes inside the seams of its armor plating which can only be seen when Groudon is glowing with power.\n\nAs Primal Groudon, its appearance is similar to Groudon, but larger in size. Its skin color changes from dark red to deep crimson with its underside, spikes, and teeth turning black. The blades on its tail are more separated from one another. The {{tt|Ω|Omega}} symbol is now shown on its arms. Its eyes, the inside of its mouth, and the now-enlarged openings between its armor plating glow bright yellow, and its irises are now red. The energy that fills Primal Groudon pours forth as magma, and it burns with such an extreme temperature that its body is always shimmering with the haze of its heat.<ref name="Primal">http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-us/pokemon/legendary-pokemon/primal-groudon</ref> In the [[XYS02|anime]], Primal Groudon is said to create new land with every step it takes.\n\nGroudon is an immensely powerful Pokémon, having the ability to summon intense droughts and cause volcanic eruptions. The droughts it can cause allow it to evaporate water, while the volcanic eruptions it can summon enable it to create land. It sleeps {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rough-terrain Pokémon|underground}} in large magma chambers. If it encounters its rival, {{p|Kyogre}}, they will engage in a cataclysmic battle. Groudon is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Precipice Blades}}.\n\n==In the anime==\n===In the main series===\n[[File:Groudon anime.png|thumb|left|250px|Groudon in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]\n[[File:Primal Groudon anime.png|left|thumb|250px|Primal Groudon in the anime]]\n====Major appearances====\n=====[[Groudon (M06)]]=====\nIn \'\'[[M06|Jirachi: Wish Maker]]\'\', a former [[Team Magma]] scientist named [[Butler]], working as a magician at the [[Millennium Festival]], wished to use {{OBP|Jirachi|M06}} to bring forth a Groudon. However, what he ended up with was not a Groudon, but a manifestation of pure evil that had the appearance of a Groudon. At the end, Jirachi used {{m|Doom Desire}} to destroy the false Groudon.\n\n====={{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Groudon (AG)|Groudon (\'\'Advanced Generation\'\' series)}}=====\nGroudon made its physical main series debut in \'\'[[AG097|Gaining Groudon]]\'\'. [[Team Aqua]] had captured Groudon but did not have [[Blue Orb|the correct orb]] to control it, so they planned to make a trade with [[Team Magma]], who had captured Kyogre. The trade was about to be made when [[Archie]] decided to use Kyogre to destroy everyone, including his fellow henchmen. The {{pkmn|battle}} between Kyogre and Groudon occurred in \'\'[[AG098|The Scuffle of Legends]]\'\'.\n\n====={{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Groudon (XY)|Groudon (\'\'XY\'\' series)}}=====\nA Groudon made a cameo appearance in \'\'[[XYS02|Mega Evolution Special II]]\'\', where it was shown being awakened by the presence of the [[Giant Rock]]. It played a bigger role in \'\'[[XYS03|Mega Evolution Special III]]\'\', where it was shown in its [[Primal Reversion|primal state]], fighting with Primal {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Kyogre (XY)|Kyogre}} over the Giant Rock. The same Groudon reappeared in flashbacks during \'\'[[XY092|Cloudy Fate, Bright Future!]]\'\' and \'\'[[XY138|The First Day of the Rest of Your Life!]]\'\'.\n\n=====Other=====\nA Groudon appeared in \'\'[[DP043|Malice In Wonderland!]]\'\' as an illusion created by {{p|Mismagius}}.\n\nA Groudon briefly appeared in the beginning of \'\'[[M18|Hoopa and the Clash of Ages]]\'\', being one of the many Pokémon summoned by {{an|Hoopa}} to defeat in the past. A Primal Groudon later appeared as one of six [[Legendary Pokémon]] summoned and hypnotized by the shadow {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Hoopa|Hoopa Unbound}} as its reinforcements. It and its teammates engaged in a battle against the {{p|Latios}}, {{p|Latias}}, and {{Shiny}} {{p|Rayquaza}} summoned to protect the real Hoopa in [[Dahara City]]. Eventually, after the shadow Hoopa was sealed in a [[Prison Bottle]], the hypnosis on Primal Groudon and the other Legendary Pokémon was lifted, and Primal Groudon departed for its home.\n\n====Minor appearances====\nGroudon debuted in the opening sequence of \'\'[[M06|Jirachi: Wish Maker]]\'\', where it was seen rising out of lava in a volcanic area while being monitored by [[Team Magma]].\n\nGroudon made its main series debut in a fantasy in \'\'[[AG036|The Spheal of Approval]]\'\'.\n\nA Groudon appeared in a fantasy in \'\'[[AG083|Unfair Weather Friends]]\'\'.\n\nA Groudon made a cameo appearance in the opening sequence of \'\'[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]\'\'.\n\nA Groudon made a cameo appearance in the opening sequence of \'\'[[M10|The Rise of Darkrai]]\'\', where it exploded out of a makeshift, mountain-based battlefield.\n\nA Groudon made a cameo appearance in the opening sequence of \'\'[[M12|Arceus and the Jewel of Life]]\'\'.\n\nA Groudon made a cameo appearance in the opening sequence of \'\'[[M13|Zoroark: Master of Illusions]]\'\'.\n\n[[File:Primal Groudon ORAS Trailer.png|thumb|220px|left|Primal Groudon in the animated trailer]]\n[[File:Primal Groudon PG.png|thumb|220px|Primal Groudon in [[Pokémon Generations]]]]\n\n===In the Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire Animated Trailer===\nA Primal Groudon appeared in the [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Pokémon Alpha Sapphire Animated Trailer]], where it rose from the ground and battled a Primal {{p|Kyogre}} with its {{m|Precipice Blades}}.\n\n===In Pokémon Generations===\nA Primal Groudon appeared in a vision that {{FB|Magma Admin|Courtney}} had in \'\'[[PG07|The Vision]]\'\'. In that vision, it destroyed a chain of islands before attacking [[Maxie]] and [[Tabitha]]. While she was puzzled by the vision\'s meaning, this ultimately did not deter her from carrying on Team Magma\'s plans.\n{{-}}\n\n==In the manga==\n[[File:Maxie Groudon Adventures.png|thumb|150px|Groudon in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]\n[[File:Primal Groudon Adventures.png|thumb|150px|Primal Groudon in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]\n===In the movie adaptations===\n{{main|Groudon (M06)}}\nAn evil creature resembling a Groudon was the result of [[Butler]]\'s failed experiment in the {{ma|Jirachi: Wish Maker|manga adaptation}} of \'\'[[M06|Jirachi: Wish Maker]]\'\' by [[Oouchi Suigun]].\n\n===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===\n{{main|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)#Groudon|Groudon (Adventures)}}\nGroudon\'s first appearance was in \'\'[[PS214|Assaulted by Pelipper I]]\'\'. Awakening Groudon was the main mission of [[Team Magma]], so they could expand the land. Groudon was finally awakened when Team Magma and [[Team Aqua|Aqua]] formed a temporary truce to be able to go underwater. [[Wallace]], [[Brawly]], and [[Roxanne]] tried to stop the Pokémon\'s advance but failed due to the interventions of [[Blaise]], [[Magma Admin Courtney|Courtney]], and [[Tabitha]]. Eventually, it reaches its destination: [[Sootopolis City]], to battle {{p|Kyogre}}, which it did for days on end until {{adv|Ruby}}, with the aid of a reformed Courtney and his own, {{p|Rayquaza}}-controlling [[Norman|father]], managed to quell it. Afterwards, it cut its ties with Kyogre and went to resume its slumber at the bottom of [[Mt. Chimney]]. It is shown afterwards that this restored the volcanic activities that Team Aqua had earlier annulled.\n\nA Primal Groudon appeared in a fantasy in \'\'[[PAORAS05|Omega Alpha Adventure 5]]\'\'.\n\n===In the Pokémon Battrio: Aim to be Battrio Master! manga===\n[[Ryū Tendō]] owns a Groudon which debuted in [[ABM10]].\n\n===In the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Ginji\'s Rescue Team manga===\nGroudon appeared in \'\'[[GRT5|Why I Became a Pokémon.

Brawl]]]]\n===[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]===\nGroudon is obtainable as a {{i|Poké Ball}} Pokémon. It uses {{m|Overheat}} to immolate itself in a fiery aura, causing anyone (except the summoner) who comes into contact with it to be knocked back and receive damage, similar to the attack of {{p|Moltres}}, though it lasts longer. Due to its tremendous size, it takes up a lot of the stage, making its attack almost inescapable. However, Groudon\'s attack is significantly weaker than Moltres\', as it deals less knockback and damage; making it very hard to directly KO an opponent until they reach a very high damage percentage.\n\n====Trophy information====\n\'\'"A Continent Pokémon. In ancient times, it brought down droughts to save people who had suffered from floods. It is normally found in the profound depths of the earth, where it slumbers in magma. With a mighty roar, it uses {{m|Earthquake}} to mow down enemies. In battle, it summons sunlight to bathe the area. It once had an epic battle with {{p|Kyogre}}."\'\'\n\n===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]===\nGroudon appears as a trophy.\n\n====Trophy information====\n\'\'\'NA\'\'\': \'\'Groudon is called the Continent Pokémon, and that\'s not just because it lives on them.

Ultimate]]===\nBoth Groudon and Primal Groudon appear as {{sbw|Spirits (characters)|Spirits}}.\n\n==Game data==\n===NPC appearances===\n* [[Pokémon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire]]: Groudon is the focus of the second Bonus Field on the [[Ruby Field]]. Groudon will throw rocks down from the ceiling to add obstacles to the field and create an {{m|eruption}} to surround itself in pillars of fire. The rocks take three hits to break while the fire pillars take four hits to break. During this time, Groudon will also throw fire balls at the Poké Ball to stall it further. The eruption does break any rocks still on the field. Groudon must be hit 15 times in three minutes to win. After beating the round twice, Groudon will be captured.\n*[[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team]]: When the player completes the [[Mt. Freeze]] dungeon for the first time, after {{p|Ninetales}} is spoken to, an earthquake will happen, then Ninetales says that Groudon has awakened, and will wreak havoc. Team ACT will then go off and try to stop Groudon, only to be defeated, then a new team, made up of {{p|Blastoise}}, {{p|Golem}}, and {{p|Octillery}}. When they get defeated, the player\'s team have to go to [[Magma Cavern]] themselves and defeat Groudon.\n*[[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness]]: When the player visits [[Steam Cave]] for the first time, {{p|Uxie}} creates a fake Groudon, hoping that it would keep the player\'s team away from knowing Fogbound Lake\'s existence in order to protect the [[Time Gear]] it has been guarding. After the credits, a real Groudon appears in [[Shimmer Desert]] as the guardian of the [[Seven Treasures|Terra Cymbal]].\n\n===Pokédex entries===\n====Groudon====\n{{Dex/Header|type=Ground}}\n{{Dex/NA|gen=III}}\n{{Dex/Gen/2|gen=III|reg1=Hoenn|num1=199|reg2=Kanto}}\n{{Dex/Entry1|v=Ruby|t=FFF|entry=Groudon has long been described in mythology as the Pokémon that raised lands and expanded continents.

They are both known as the Continent Pokémon.\n* Primal Groudon has the highest base {{stat|Attack}} stat and base stat total of all {{type|Ground}} and {{type|Fire}} Pokémon.\n** It also has the highest base {{stat|Attack}} and base {{stat|Defense}} stats of all {{type|Fire}} Pokémon and the highest base {{stat|Special Attack}} stat of all {{type|Ground}} Pokémon.\n* The [[Groudon (M06)|fake Groudon]] in \'\'[[M06|Jirachi: Wish Maker]]\'\' is [[Size discrepancies in the Pokémon anime|much taller]] than its game height of 11\' 06", being as tall as the mountainous structures in [[Forina]]. When an actual Groudon [[AG097|later]] [[AG098|appeared]] in the anime series, it was much closer to its correct size.\n* On the DVD cover of \'\'Jirachi: Wish Maker\'\', a normal Groudon is depicted, despite the Groudon in the film not being an actual Groudon.\n* In [[Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness]], the character [[Chobin]] operates a [[Robo Groudon]] after the [[Michael|player]] defeats him for the third time.\n* Although Groudon is genderless in the [[core series]] games, it is referred to as a male in [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness]].\n* A Groudon [[Pokémon cosplay|costume]] is worn by [[Terrell]] in [[Pokémon Battle Revolution]].\n\n===Origin===\nGroudon may be modeled after the Earth\'s land and volcanoes and may be a personification of the land. Its conflict with Kyogre is similar to that of {{wp|Behemoth}} and {{wp|Leviathan}} of Hebrew legend, who at the end of time would start a battle that would kill them both.\n\nLike Groudon, Behemoth is associated with the land. However, while Behemoth is usually depicted as a {{wp|Phacochoerus|warthog}}/{{wp|hippopotamus}}-like creature, Groudon resembles a {{wp|Therapoda|therapod}} dinosaur, with spikes resembling various species of {{wp|Ankylosauria}}.\n\n====Name origin====\nGroudon may be a combination of \'\'ground\'\' and \'\'don\'\' (Spanish for \'\'lord\'\'). \'\'Don\'\' also means \'\'tooth\'\' in Ancient Greek and is commonly used in {{wp|dinosaur}} names, which Groudon somewhat resembles.
