Prior to [[Generation II]], it was a pure {{type|Electric}} Pokémon.\n\nIt [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Magneton}} starting at [[level]] 30, which evolves into {{p|Magnezone}} when [[level]]ed up in a [[special magnetic field]].\n\n==Biology==\nMagnemite is a seemingly robotic Pokémon that has a gray, spherical metal body with blue-and-red tipped horseshoe magnets on each side and a single, large eye. It has three {{wp|Phillips head}} screws on its body: two near the bottom of its body and the one on top of its head that looks similar to an antenna. The two bottom screws serve no noticeable purpose, although they may be its feet as the Pokédex identifies a footprint similar to that of the screw\'s head. Even though Magnemite and its evolved forms are mechanical creatures, [[EP101|the anime has shown]] that it has emotions and a way of reproducing. [[EP195|It has even exhibited]] the need to eat, although its main form of nutrients is electrical currents. It is commonly found in locations such as {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rough-terrain Pokémon|power plants or caves}} with a strong magnetic field. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, [[Media:Neo Premium File 2.jpg|Magnemite has been depicted in carvings]] discovered at the [[Ruins of Alph]] and has been present in [[AZ]]\'s retelling of the [[Kalos]] war, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years.\n\nThe magnetic units on Magnemite\'s body create electromagnetic waves that allow it to defy gravity and can potentially disrupt electrical equipment. Magnemite is not known to be unnecessarily aggressive, but may approach Trainers with little notice. If a wild Magnemite is approached, [[Escape#Wild Pokémon|it may simply flee]] on rare occasions, as Magnemite does not care for interaction. However, if attacked, it will start retaliation with non-damaging moves. In the care of a Trainer, it can be a devoted fighter. However, [[EP195|it has been demonstrated that]] it may be deterred unless a strong bond is formed with its Trainer.\n\nMagnemite can be attracted to anything emitting electricity or a magnetic field, including gadgets such as a [[Pokétch]]. [[EP030|It has even been shown]] to be attracted to electric Pokémon producing such fields. With modern electrical lines buried underground, Magnemite attacks on power plants have increased. To prevent power outages, these power plants deliberately send out signals Magnemite cannot stand to ward them off.\n\n==In the anime==\n===In the main series===\n[[File:Clemont Magnemite.png|thumb|left|250px|Magnemite in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]\n====Major appearances====\nMagnemite debuted in \'\'[[EP030|Sparks Fly for Magnemite]]\'\'. {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} were in [[Gringey City]] while the power went out. When they were looking around for the cause of the power outage, a lone Magnemite showed up and was attracted to [[Ash\'s Pikachu]], who had a cold. When a group of {{p|Grimer}} and its {{AP|Muk}} leader were chasing Ash and his friends, a group of Magnemite and {{p|Magneton}} helped fight them off.\n\nMultiple Magnemite appeared in \'\'[[EP101|Get Along, Little Pokémon]]\'\', under the ownership of {{OBP|Ethan|EP101}}. He used them to harness electrical energy from bolts of lightning during thunderstorms, with this energy being given to towns without power. One of the Magnemite, [[nickname]]d Number 6, evolved into a Magneton to save Ash and Pikachu from {{TRT}}.\n\nThree Magnemite appeared in \'\'[[EP195|The Poké Spokesman]]\'\', under the ownership of a group of [[phony Pokémon interpreters]].

It was seen riding on Jasmine\'s shoulder through the whole episode. Magnemite was later used in her [[Gym]] {{pkmn|battle}} with Ash in \'\'[[EP224|Nerves of Steelix!]]\'\'; it battled {{AP|Pikachu}}, who was able to defeat Magnemite with {{m|Quick Attack}}.\n\nA Magnemite appeared in \'\'[[AG040|Watt\'s with Wattson?]]\'\', under the ownership of [[Wattson]].

This makes them the first Pokémon to ever change typing with the progress of generations.\n* Despite most of Magnemite\'s Pokédex entries saying they are able to float through the air by employing powerful electromagnetic waves or even anti-gravity, Magnemite does not have the Ability {{a|Levitate}}, so it is still affected by {{type|Ground}} moves. However, starting in [[Generation IV]], Magnemite can learn {{m|Magnet Rise}}, which simulates Levitate for five turns.\n* Magnemite, along with {{p|Magneton}}, has [[List of Pokémon that appear in every regional Pokédex|appeared in every regional Pokédex]]. This is due to the Sinnoh Pokédex\'s expansion in Platinum and the Unova Pokédex\'s expansion in Black 2 and White 2.\n* Magnemite and its evolution Magneton are two of the few Pokémon that had their [[cry]] changed slightly in [[Generation III]]. This was due to Generation III utilizing a better sound effects game engine and [[Game Boy Advance|newer game system]].\n* {{g|Snap}} is the only form of a Pokémon canon that shows two Magnemite bonding, similar to a Magneton. However, when a picture is taken, they are still called Magnemite.\n** {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team}} also showed this, but it was stated to be a failed evolution, due to the lack of a third Magnemite.\n* In [[Generation V]], Magnemite was the most traded Pokémon on the [[GTS]]. This is probably due to what is known as the Magnemite chain/coil: a scheme by which players could increase the number of visitors to their [[Join Avenue]] in {{2v2|Black|White|2}} by trading Magnemite on the GTS. The scheme originated with Japanese players and became popular worldwide.\n* On May 31, 2017, [[The Pokémon Company]] posted a Magnemite-themed music video onto their YouTube channel titled [[Where is Coil? Here is Coil!]].\n\n===Origin===\nMagnemite seems to be based on a {{wp|magnet}}. It may also be based on the objectification of {{wp|electromagnetism}}, one of the four {{wp|fundamental interactions}} of nature.\n\n====Name origin====\nMagnemite may be a play on \'\'{{wp|magnetite}}\'\'. It may also be a combination of \'\'magnet\'\' or \'\'magnetite\'\' and \'\'mite\'\', referring to its small size.\n\nCoil is literally \'\'coil\'\', perhaps referring to the fact that a coil with electric current generates a magnetic field.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Other languages|type=electric|type2=steel\n|ja=コイル \'\'Coil\'\'|jameaning=From \'\'coil\'\'\n|fr=Magnéti|frmeaning=From \'\'{{tt|magnétique|magnetic}}\'\', and \'\'{{tt|petit|small}}\'\'\n|es=Magnemite|esmeaning=Same as English name\n|de=Magnetilo|demeaning=From \'\'Magnet\'\' and \'\'{{tt|ilo|Esperanto for \'tool\'}}\'\'\n|it=Magnemite|itmeaning=Same as English name\n|ko=코일 \'\'Koil\'\'|komeaning=Transliteration of Japanese name\n|zh_yue=小磁怪 \'\'Síuchìhgwaai\'\'|zh_yuemeaning=Literally "Little magnetic monster"\n|zh_cmn=小磁怪 \'\'Xiǎocíguài\'\'|zh_cmnmeaning=Literally "Little magnetic monster"\n|he=מגנמייט \'\'Magnemayt\'\'|hemeaning=Transcription of English name\n|hi=मॅगनेमाइट \'\'Magnemite\'\'|himeaning=Transcription of English name\n|ru=Магнемайт \'\'Magnemayt\'\'|rumeaning=Transcription of English name\n|th=คอยล์ \'\'Coil\'\'|thmeaning=Same as Japanese name\n}}\n<br clear="left">\n\n==External links==\n\n{{PokémonPrevNext/Head|type=Electric|type2=Steel}}\n{{PokémonPrevNext/Pokémon|type=Electric|prevnum=080|prev=Slowbro|nextnum=082|next=Magneton}}\n|}\n{{-}}\n{{Project Pokédex notice}}\n\n[[Category:Single-type Pokémon|081]]<!--In Gen I-->\n[[Category:Pokémon that run from battle]]\n[[Category:Pokémon that have had their type changed]]\n\n[[de:Magnetilo]]\n[[es:Magnemite]]\n[[fr:Magnéti]]\n[[it:Magnemite]]\n[[ja:コイル]]\n[[zh:小磁怪]]'}
