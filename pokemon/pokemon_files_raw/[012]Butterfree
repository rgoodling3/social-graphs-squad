It is the final form of {{p|Caterpie}}. It also has a [[Gigantamax]] form.\n\n==Biology==\nButterfree resembles a vaguely anthropomorphic butterfly with a purple body. Unlike true insects, it only has two body segments and four light blue legs. The upper pair of legs resembles small, three-fingered hands, while the lower pair resembles long, digit-less feet. Butterfree has two black antennae, a light blue snout with two fangs underneath, and large, red compound eyes. Its two pairs of wings are white with black {{wp|Insect wing#Venation|venation}}. Two oval scales on a female Butterfree\'s lower wings are black, but they are white on a male.\n\nAs Gigantamax Butterfree, its size increases to gigantic length with altered look. The wings and its pattern changes to light and dark green color with white. The antennae changes to bright green and extends to the point the tip bends with three red clouds surrounding it. The eyes changes to bright glowing red. A Fur like circle is attach to both the wings and back of Butterfree. Several green scales can be seen floating around Butterfree. Gigantamax Butterfree\'s scales are its most effect weapons, capable of releasing paralysis, poisoning, or sleep through its wings. The massive wings are powerful enough to lift a 10-ton truck through a simple flap. The wind it generates  can scattered poisonous scales throughout the area, making it dangerous to be near it.<ref>https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon-galar-region/gigantamax-butterfree/</ref>\n\nButterfree\'s wings are covered with poisonous powders that fall off continuously as it flies. It will defend {{p|Caterpie}} from bird Pokémon using this powder. This powder also repels water, enabling it to gather honey even in the rain. Butterfree will roam up to six miles (ten kilometers) from its nest in search of honey, which it carries with the hairs of its legs. Sometimes it has territorial disputes with {{p|Cutiefly}} over fields of flowers. It also consumes sap from trees pierced by {{p|Heracross}}, as seen in [[EP119|the anime]]. Butterfree is found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|temperate forests and jungles}}, but it has also [[EP021|been observed]] flying near the ocean as part of its migratory breeding pattern. \n\nGigantamax Butterfree is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of using the exclusive [[G-Max Move]] G-Max Befuddle.\n\n==In the anime==\n===In the main series===\n[[File:Ash Butterfree M20.png|250px|thumb|left|Butterfree in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]\n[[File:Orange Islands Butterfree.png|thumb|250px|An {{DL|List of alternately colored Pokémon in the anime|Orange Archipelago Butterfree}} in the anime]]\n====Major appearances====\n=====[[Ash\'s Butterfree]]=====\n{{Ash}} had a Butterfree that he {{pkmn2|caught}} as a {{p|Caterpie}}, the first Pokémon he ever caught.

This has only been seen in a single female, and unlike a {{Shiny}} Butterfree, which has green eyes and pink wings, limbs, and snout, this Butterfree only differed in its pink body and wings.\n* Butterfree has been trained by four important {{pkmn|Trainer}}s in the {{pkmn|anime}}: {{Ash}}, [[Ritchie]], [[Solidad]], and [[Drew]].\n* Butterfree shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Beautifly}}. They are both known as the Butterfly Pokémon.\n* Butterfree can be seen as a parallel to {{p|Beedrill}}. Both of their unevolved stages evolve at level 7 and again at level 10. They both go through metamorphosis-like evolution and have the same base stat total of 395. Also, while Beedrill is [[Game-exclusive Pokémon|exclusive]] to {{game3|Black and White|Black|s}} and [[Pokémon Black and White Versions 2|Black 2]], Butterfree is exclusive to White and White 2.\n\n===Origin===\nButterfree\'s design appears to be based on the {{wp|Aporia crataegi|black-veined white}} {{wp|butterfly}}.\n\n[[Gigantamax]] Butterfree resembles the \'\'{{wp|kaiju}}\'\' {{wp|Mothra}}.\n\n====Name origin====\nButterfree is a combination of \'\'{{wp|butterfly}}\'\' and \'\'free\'\', possibly referring to its ability to fly after being grounded for two evolutionary stages. It may also involve パタパタ \'\'patapata\'\' (onomatopoeia for something flapping, such as wings) and 振る \'\'furu\'\' (to flap, as in wings).\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Other languages|type=Bug|type2=Flying\n|ja=バタフリー \'\'Butterfree\'\'|jameaning=From {{tt|バタフライ \'\'batafurai\'\'|butterfly}} and {{tt|フリー \'\'furī\'\'|free}}\n|fr=Papilusion|frmeaning=From {{tt|\'\'papillon\'\'|butterfly}} and \'\'illusion\'\'\n|es=Butterfree|esmeaning=Same as English/Japanese name\n|de=Smettbo|demeaning=From {{tt|\'\'Schmetterling\'\'|butterfly}} and possibly {{tt|\'\'Bö\'\'|gust}}\n|it=Butterfree|itmeaning=Same as English/Japanese name\n|ko=버터플 \'\'Butterfle\'\'|komeaning=Corruption of {{tt|버터플라이 \'\'beoteopeullai\'\'|butterfly}}\n|bg=Батърфри \'\'Batŭrfri\'\'|bgmeaning=Transcription of English name\n|zh_yue=巴他蝶 \'\'Bātādihp\'\'|zh_yuemeaning=Partial transliteration of Japanese name. 蝶 is from {{tt|蝴蝶 \'\'wùhdihp\'\'|butterfly}}\n|zh_cmn=巴大蝴 \'\'Bādàhú\'\'|zh_cmnmeaning=Partial transliteration of Japanese name. 蝴 is from {{tt|蝴蝶 \'\'húdié\'\'|butterfly}}\n|hu={{tt|Csodalepke|Mewtwo Returns only, where it was mistakenly translated}}|humeaning="Wonder butterfly"\n|lt=Drugelaisvis|ltmeaning=From {{tt|\'\'drugys\'\'|butterfly}} and {{tt|\'\'laisvas\'\'|free}}\n|ru=Баттерфри \'\'Batterfri\'\'|rumeaning=Transcription of English/Japanese name\n|he=בטרפרי \'\'Butterfree\'\'|hemeaning=Transcription of English name\n|hi=बटरफ्री \'\'Batterfri\'\'|himeaning=Transcription of English/Japanese name\n}}\n<br clear="left">\n\n==Related articles==\n* [[Ash\'s Butterfree]]\n* [[Pink Butterfree]]\n* [[Kitty]]\n* [[Butterfree (Red and Blue Rescue Team)]]\n<!--\n==Notes==\n<references />-->\n\n==External links==\n* {{wp|Caterpie, Metapod, and Butterfree|Article on Wikipedia}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{PokémonPrevNext/Head|type=Bug|type2=Flying}}\n{{PokémonPrevNext/Pokémon|type=Bug|prevnum=011|prev=Metapod|nextnum=013|next=Weedle|round=yes}}\n|}\n{{Project Pokédex notice}}\n\n[[Category:Shadow Pokémon in Pokémon XD]]\n[[Category:Pokémon whose base stats changed in Generation VI]]\n\n[[de:Smettbo]]\n[[es:Butterfree]]\n[[fr:Papilusion]]\n[[it:Butterfree]]\n[[ja:バタフリー]]\n[[zh:巴大蝶]]'}
