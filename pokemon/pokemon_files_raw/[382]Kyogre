In ancient times, it came into conflict with {{p|Groudon}}, a Pokémon with the ability to expand continents. In {{game3|Ruby and Sapphire|Pokémon Sapphire|s}}, {{v2|Emerald}}, and [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|Alpha Sapphire]], Kyogre is sought after by [[Team Aqua]] as part of their plot to create more habitats for aquatic Pokémon by raising the sea level.\n\nKyogre is the [[game mascot]] of Pokémon Sapphire and its remake, Pokémon Alpha Sapphire, with Kyogre appearing on the box art of Sapphire and Primal Kyogre appearing on the box art of Alpha Sapphire.\n\nAlong with {{p|Groudon}} and {{p|Rayquaza}}, Kyogre is a part of the [[weather trio]].\n\n==Biology==\nKyogre is a massive whale-like Pokémon with two big pectoral fins, each with four white square-shaped nails. It has a deep blue body and a white chin area with two small spikes protruding under it. Above each eye are two white, oval-shaped spots. It has red stripes around its chin, eyes, dorsal fins, and torso. These stripes glow when Kyogre is brimming with power. The tail is tattered with four trailing parts, the inner ones being smaller than the outer. Its eyes are small, yellow, and shadowed with black.\n\nPrimal Kyogre retains its general body structure, but grows to more than double the size of its base form. Its main skin color becomes a darker shade of blue, the red markings along its body become light blue, and its eyes glow yellow with orange irises and orange-red pupils. The markings on its pectoral fins slightly change to form {{tt|α|Alpha}} symbols, which connect to its outer nails with red markings connecting the inner nails. Every part of its skin that was white in its base form becomes clear and translucent, with the large ovals on its head now connected to clear markings stretching from its tail to its forehead, where another {{tt|α|Alpha}} symbol is formed. The trailing parts of its tail grow longer and gain translucent webbing, and the areas between its pectoral fin markings also become clear. The translucent parts of its body reveal organ-like structures that glow with a mysterious light; it has a large "organ" at the center of its body, two smaller ones aligned with the large oval markings, and two more located in its pectoral fins. In the [[XYS02|anime]], Primal Kyogre is said to have widened the seas by a large margin simply by taking a swim.\n\nKyogre is said to be a powerful Pokémon, having control over the element of water and rain. It is said to have expanded the seas, and is hailed as a savior for quenching areas of the world plagued with drought. Kyogre is normally calm and peaceful, but if it meets its rival, {{p|Groudon}}, Kyogre will engage in a cataclysmic battle against it. In the {{pkmn|Mystery Dungeon series}} and [[core series]], Kyogre is able to fly. Kyogre generally lives deep in the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Sea Pokémon|ocean}}, and is said to rest in a deep trench. Kyogre is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Origin Pulse}}.\n\n==In the anime==\n===In the main series===\n[[File:Kyogre M09.png|thumb|left|250px|Kyogre in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]\n[[File:Primal Kyogre anime.png|thumb|left|250px|Primal Kyogre in the anime]]\n====Major appearances====\n====={{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Kyogre (AG)|Kyogre (\'\'Advanced Generation\'\' series)}}=====\nKyogre made its physical main series debut in \'\'[[AG097|Gaining Groudon]]\'\'. [[Team Magma]] had captured Kyogre but didn\'t have [[Red Orb|the correct orb]] to control it, so they planned to make a trade with [[Team Aqua]], who had captured Groudon. The trade was about to be made when [[Archie]] decided to use Kyogre to destroy everyone, including his fellow henchmen. The {{pkmn|battle}} between Kyogre and Groudon occurred in \'\'[[AG098|The Scuffle of Legends]]\'\'.\n\n====={{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Kyogre (XY)|Kyogre (\'\'XY\'\' series)}}=====\nA Kyogre made a cameo appearance in \'\'[[XYS02|Mega Evolution Special II]]\'\', where it was shown being awakened by the presence of the [[Giant Rock]]. It played a bigger role in \'\'[[XYS03|Mega Evolution Special III]]\'\', where it was shown in its [[Primal Reversion|primal state]], fighting with Primal {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Groudon (XY)|Groudon}} over the Giant Rock. It also fought [[Steven\'s Metagross|Steven\'s Mega Metagross]], and was almost defeated by it until Metagross was defeated by [[Mega Evolution|Mega]] {{DL|Recurring wild Pokémon in the anime|Rayquaza}}. The same Kyogre reappeared in flashbacks during \'\'[[XY092|Cloudy Fate, Bright Future!]]\'\' and \'\'[[XY138|The First Day of the Rest of Your Life!]]\'\'.\n\n=====Other=====\nA Kyogre appeared in \'\'[[M09|Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea]]\'\'. It appeared along with countless other {{type|Water}} Pokémon when {{Ash}} replaced all of the [[Sea Crown]]\'s crystals. However, when [[The Phantom]] attempted to make all the Water-types panic using supersonic waves from his ship, Kyogre was part of the ensuing commotion. {{OBP|Manaphy|M09}} calmed them down using {{m|Heart Swap}} to rid the Pokémon of their confusion, and some {{p|Wailord}} broke open The Phantom\'s ship, followed by some {{p|Chinchou}} swimming into the opening and short-circuiting the ship. Kyogre then used {{m|Hyper Beam}} on the ship, destroying it.\n\nA Kyogre briefly appeared in the beginning of \'\'[[M18|Hoopa and the Clash of Ages]]\'\', being one of the many Pokémon summoned by {{an|Hoopa}} to defeat in the past. A Primal Kyogre later appeared as one of six [[Legendary Pokémon]] summoned and hypnotized by the shadow {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Hoopa|Hoopa Unbound}} as its reinforcements. It and its teammates engaged in a battle against the {{p|Latios}}, {{p|Latias}}, and {{Shiny}} {{p|Rayquaza}} summoned to protect the real Hoopa in [[Dahara City]]. Eventually, after the shadow Hoopa was sealed in a [[Prison Bottle]], the hypnosis on Primal Kyogre and the other Legendary Pokémon was lifted, and Primal Kyogre departed for its home.\n\nA Kyogre appeared in \'\'[[SM120|The One That Didn\'t Get Away!]]\'\'. It had been {{status|poison}}ed and was being pursued by a {{OBP|Hunter|SM120|Pokémon Hunter}} and [[Hunter\'s underlings|his underlings]]. However, {{an|Lana}} was able to feed it some [[Antidote]], restoring its health and allowing it to defeat the hunter. However, Kyogre was still enraged afterwards, forcing Lana to reel it in with her [[fishing|fishing rod]] and have her {{TP|Lana|Primarina}} sing to it in order to calm it down.\n\n====Minor appearances====\nKyogre debuted in the opening sequence of \'\'[[M06|Jirachi: Wish Maker]]\'\', where it was seen swimming across the ocean near the seabed.\n\nKyogre made its main series debut in a fantasy in \'\'[[AG083|Unfair Weather Friends]]\'\'.\n\nA Kyogre made a cameo appearance in the opening sequence of \'\'[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]\'\'.\n\nA Kyogre made a cameo appearance in the opening sequence of \'\'[[M10|The Rise of Darkrai]]\'\', where it was shown jumping out of the ocean and diving back in.\n\nA Kyogre made a cameo appearance in the opening sequence of \'\'[[M11|Giratina and the Sky Warrior]]\'\'.\n\nA Kyogre made a cameo appearance in the opening sequence of \'\'[[M13|Zoroark: Master of Illusions]]\'\'.\n\nA Kyogre appeared in \'\'[[SM005|Yo, Ho, Ho! Go, Popplio!]]\'\', during a fantasy where Lana imagined she might hook one whilst fishing.\n\nA Kyogre appeared in a fantasy in \'\'[[SM099|We Know Where You\'re Going, Eevee!]]\'\'.\n\n===In the Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire Animated Trailer===\nA Primal Kyogre appeared in the [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Pokémon Alpha Sapphire Animated Trailer]], where it leaped from the sea and battled a Primal {{p|Groudon}} with its {{m|Origin Pulse}}.\n\n===In Pokémon Generations===\n[[File:Kyogre PG.png|thumb|220px|left|Kyogre in [[Pokémon Generations]]]]\n[[File:Primal Kyogre PG.png|thumb|220px|Primal Kyogre in Pokémon Generations]]\nA wild Kyogre appeared in \'\'[[PG08|The Cavern]]\'\', where it was awoken by [[Archie]] inside the [[Seafloor Cavern]], who used the [[Blue Orb]] to turn it into its [[Primal Reversion|Primal]] form. It escaped the Cavern and swam through its surrounding waters and surfaced above the ocean before creating a massive storm, threatening to destroy [[Hoenn]]. It was last seen attacking Archie and other members of [[Team Aqua]] when he tried to calm it down.\n{{-}}\n\n==In the manga==\n[[File:Archie Kyogre Adventures.png|thumb|125px|Kyogre in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]\n[[File:Primal Kyogre Adventures.png|thumb|left|200px|Primal Kyogre in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]\n===In the Ash & Pikachu manga===\nKyogre appeared in \'\'[[SP28|Saving Kyogre, The Lord Of The Ocean Depths!]]\'\'.\n\n===In the Pokémon Adventures manga===\n{{main|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)#Kyogre|Kyogre (Adventures)}}\nKyogre\'s first appearance was in \'\'[[PS214|Assaulted by Pelipper I]]\'\'. It was awakened by Team Aqua in order to achieve their goal of expanding the sea. [[Wattson]], [[Flannery]], and [[Winona]] tried to stop it but failed due to Team Aqua\'s interference, and it ended up reaching [[Sootopolis City]], where it fought for days on end with {{p|Groudon}}. {{adv|Ruby}}, having trapped {{adv|Sapphire}} in [[Wallace]]\'s air car for her safety, was joined by a reformed [[Magma Admin Courtney|Courtney]] and succeeded in quelling both the titans using the [[Red Orb|Red]] and [[Blue Orb]]s and [[Norman]]\'s temporary control over {{p|Rayquaza}}. In the {{chap|Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire}}, [[Blaise]] and [[Aqua Admin Amber|Amber]] tricked {{p|Hoopa}} into summoning Kyogre and Groudon from their places of rest. This, in addition to the return of Archie and Maxie, was set up in order to prevent a meteoroid from destroying the world.\n\nIn the {{chap|Emerald}}, [[Guile Hideout]] succeeded in having {{adv|Jirachi}} create a Kyogre monster made of seawater that nearly sank the entire {{gdis|Battle Frontier|III}}.\n\nA Primal Kyogre appeared in a fantasy in \'\'[[PAORAS05|Omega Alpha Adventure 5]]\'\'.\n\n===In the Pokémon Battrio: Aim to be Battrio Master! manga===\n[[Ryū Tendō]] owns a Kyogre which debuted in [[ABM14]].\n\n==In the TCG==\n{{main|Kyogre (TCG)}}\n\n==In the TFG==\nOne Kyogre figure has been released.\n* {{TFG|Next Quest}}: {{TFG ID|Next Quest|Kyogre|5}}\n\n==Other appearances==\n[[File:Kyogre SSBB.png|thumb|200px|Kyogre in [[Super Smash Bros.

Finally, it will {{m|dive}} into the water to evade being hit completely. However, air bubbles will appear where it is about to rise out of the water.

This action has its own animation and larger hitbox.\n** Additionally, a Kyogre that knows {{m|Dive}} will allow the player to avoid underwater trainer battles. This action also has its own animation and larger hitbox.\n* Primal Kyogre is the [[List of Pokémon by weight|heaviest]] {{type|Water}} Pokémon.\n\n===Origin===\nKyogre may be modeled after the Earth\'s oceans and may also be a personification of the ocean. Its conflict with Groudon is similar to that of {{wp|Leviathan}} and {{wp|Behemoth}}, who would start a battle that would kill them both at the end of time. Like Kyogre, Leviathan is associated with the sea, and the Hebrew word for Leviathan is now used for whales in Modern Hebrew, which may be why Kyogre\'s appearance also draws inspiration from {{wp|whale}}s, especially the {{wp|Killer whale|orca}}. However, Leviathan does not resemble Kyogre in traditional depictions.\n\n====Name origin====\nKyogre may be a combination of 海 \'\'kai\'\' (ocean) and \'\'{{wp|killer whale|orca}}\'\' (a species described as a whale, but is more closely related to dolphins). Notably, it may also involve 海王 \'\'kaiō\'\' (king of the sea), which are the first two characters in 海王星 \'\'Kaiōsei\'\' ({{wp|Neptune}}).\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Other languages|type=Water|type2=Water\n|ja=カイオーガ \'\'Kyogre\'\'|jameaning=From 海 \'\'kai\'\' (ocean) and \'\'orca\'\'.
