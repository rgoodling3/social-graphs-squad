It can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into \'\'\'Mega Gyarados\'\'\' using the [[Gyaradosite]].\n\n==Biology==\n[[File:Gyarados Mouth Closed.png|thumb|left|230px|Gyarados with its mouth closed]]\nGyarados is a serpentine Pokémon with a long body covered in slightly overlapping scales. It is mostly blue with a yellow underbelly and a row of yellow spots down each side. Its mouth is very large and gaping, bearing four pointed teeth and yellow lips. It has one {{wp|barbel (anatomy)|barbel}} and a small white fin on each side of its face. The barbels are white on a female and tan on a male. It has small, red eyes, a three-pointed, dark blue crest on its head, and four white, spiky {{wp|dorsal fin}}s. Gyarados\'s tail fin is similar in structure to the crest on its head, except with a thin, white fin spread between the points.\n\nThe process of evolution causes a change in its brain structure that is believed to cause its violent nature. Gyarados\'s fangs can crush stones and its scales are harder than steel. Gyarados is feared for its fierce temper and wanton destructive tendencies. It appears in times of conflict and destroys the surrounding area. Its rampages have been known to last a month at a time. Gyarados lives in both {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water\'s-edge Pokémon|fresh and salty waters}}. Both Gyarados and its Mega form have demonstrated in the anime that it can leap huge distances both [[HS02|from the water]] and [[XY133|from the ground]], usually several times its own body length.\n\nWhen it Mega Evolves, Gyarados becomes bulkier. The fins on its cheeks become longer and gain a yellow tint. Its crest is larger and black, and its barbels also gain considerable length. A large spike extends downward underneath its chin, and it now has a black underside with a red stripe around the edges. The yellow spots along its body are replaced by raised red scales, which propel Mega Gyarados through the water. Two large yellow fins with blue spines appear on its back. Most of the other fins along its back disappear, replaced by two rows of blue spikes. There are now four yellowish, spiky fins near is tail: two on its back and two on its underside. While its brain has a powerful destructive instinct, it will obey a {{pkmn|Trainer}} it truly trusts. Mega Gyarados is tied with {{p|Hoopa}} [[List of Pokémon with form differences|Unbound]] as the [[List of Pokémon by height|tallest]] {{type|Dark}}.\n\n==In the anime==\n===In the main series===\n[[File:Misty Gyarados.png|thumb|250px|left|Gyarados in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]\n[[File:Misty Mega Gyarados.png|thumb|250px|Mega Gyarados in the anime]]\n[[File:Lance Red Gyarados.png|thumb|250px|left|{{Shiny}} Gyarados in the anime]]\n[[File:Lysandre Mega Gyarados.png|thumb|250px|Shiny Mega Gyarados in the anime]]\n====Major appearances====\n=====[[James\'s Gyarados]]=====\n[[James]]\'s Magikarp [[Evolution|evolved]] into a Gyarados in \'\'[[EP016|Pokémon Shipwreck]]\'\' after he became frustrated with it and kicked it into the water.

Afterwards, it defeated Team Rocket.\n\nTwo Gyarados appeared in \'\'[[EP206|The Joy of Water Pokémon]]\'\'. One was an inhabitant of [[Lake Lucid]], while the other one was being treated by [[Nurse Joy]] for neck problems.

In {{game|Black and White|s 2|Black 2 and White 2}}, Gyarados can be found at levels ranging from level 1 to 100 in the [[Nature Preserve]] by using a [[Super Rod]] in rippling water.\n* In [[Generation II]] and [[Generation IV]], Gyarados is the first of only two [[Shiny Pokémon]] to be integrated into a game\'s plot (the second was {{mdc|Celebi|2}} in {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}}).\n* As of [[Generation VII]], Gyarados and its pre-evolution\'s [[Egg Group]] combination ({{egg|Water 2}} and {{egg|Dragon}}) is unique.\n* As of [[Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu! and Let\'s Go, Eevee!]], Gyarados is used by three of the nine Pokémon League Champions, being used by {{ga|Blue}}, [[Lance]], and [[Wallace]], making it the most popular Pokémon among Pokémon League Champions thus far (although Blue does not always have a Gyarados, depending on the player\'s starter Pokémon). However, Blue is the only one to use it in the [[Pokémon World Tournament]].\n** Gyarados is also a popular Pokémon among [[Gym Leader]]s, being used by [[Misty]], Blue, [[Clair]], and [[Crasher Wake]]. However, Misty doesn\'t use Gyarados during the Gym battle.\n** Gyarados has also been used twice by two {{cat|villainous team leaders}}. The first instance was [[Cyrus]] and the second instance was [[Lysandre]].\n* In many ways, Gyarados is the counterpart of {{p|Milotic}}. Both are the serpentine evolved forms of weak fish Pokémon, and both appear in times of conflict, Gyarados to destroy, Milotic to becalm. Both have base stat totals of 540, the only difference being the distribution of their {{stat|Attack}}, {{stat|Special Attack}} and {{stat|Special Defense}} stats.\n** Gyarados is tied with {{p|Milotic}} for the greatest increase in base stat total after evolving, at 340 points.\n* Mega Gyarados has highest Attack stat of all {{type|Water}} Pokémon.\n* Mega Gyarados is tied with {{p|Hoopa}} [[List of Pokémon with form differences|Unbound]] and {{p|Umbreon}} for the highest base Special Defense of all {{type|Dark}} Pokémon.\n\n===Origin===\nGyarados appears to be based on a sea dragon or {{wp|sea serpent}} and {{wp|Chinese dragon}}. It is also partially based on a legend about how carp that leaped over the Dragon Gate would become {{wp|dragon}}s. Several waterfalls and cataracts in China are believed to be the location of the Dragon Gate. This is referenced by [[Pokémon Snap]], as the player needs to get a Magikarp into a waterfall to evolve it into Gyarados. This legend is an allegory of the drive and efforts needed to overcome obstacles, which can be tied to the fact that Gyarados\' pre-evolved form, Magikarp, could possibly take a lot of drive and effort to legitimately evolve into Gyarados.\n\nGyarados\'s {{t|Flying}} type may be a reference to \'\'{{wp|koinobori}}\'\', a carp-shaped {{wp|windsock}} traditionally flown to celebrate {{wp|Children\'s Day (Japan)|Children\'s Day}} in Japan, formerly called \'\'Tango no Sekku\'\' (端午の節句). It could also be inspired by the {{wp|Inkanyamba}}, a giant, winged, eel that causes storms when angry, a trait Gyarados is famous for.\n\n====Name origin====\nGyarados may derive from 虐殺 \'\'gyakusatsu\'\' (massacre/slaughter) or 逆境 \'\'gyakkyō\'\' (hardship/adversity)—both words relate to the creature\'s violent nature and the hardship it experienced before evolving. In addition, 逆 \'\'gyaku\'\' means "reverse" or "contrary", possibly referring to how Gyarados evolves from a weak Pokémon to one capable of destroying entire cities, and, in legend, how the carp goes against the flow of the waterfall in order to reach the top. It may also involve 嵐 \'\'arashi\'\' (storm) or 争い \'\'arasoi\'\' (conflict, referencing on how it appeared during wars). The last part may be from 脅す \'\'odosu\'\' (to threaten), again owing to Gyarados\' violent nature.\n\n==In other languages==\n{{Other languages|type=water|type2=flying\n|ja=ギャラドス \'\'Gyarados\'\'|jameaning=From {{tt|虐殺 \'\'gyakusatsu\'\'|slaughter}} or {{tt|逆境 \'\'gyakkyō\'\'|adversity}}, {{tt|嵐 \'\'arashi\'\'|storm}} or {{tt|争い \'\'arasoi\'\'|conflict}}, and {{tt|脅す \'\'odosu\'\'|to threaten}}\n|fr=Léviator|frmeaning=A corruption of \'\'{{wp|Leviathan}}\'\'\n|es=Gyarados|esmeaning=Same as English/Japanese name\n|de=Garados|demeaning=Similar to English/Japanese name\n|it=Gyarados|itmeaning=Same as English/Japanese name\n|ko=갸라도스 \'\'Gyarados\'\'|komeaning=Transliteration of Japanese name\n|bg=Гайрадос \'\'Gairados\'\'|bgmeaning=A corruption of Gyarados\n|zh_yue=鯉魚龍 \'\'Léih\'yùhlùhng\'\'|zh_yuemeaning=Literally "Carp dragon".
